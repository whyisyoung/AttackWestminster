After Hurricane Sandy: Time to Learn and Implement the Lessons in Preparedness, Response, and Resilience Hurricane Sandy lived up to expectations in October 2012, delivering a powerful punch with heavy rains, strong winds, and significant storm surges. After taking 69 lives in the Caribbean, Sandy hit the eastern United States, where it claimed 72 more lives.[1] Coastal communities in the Mid-Atlantic were among the hardest hit by the storm. Flooding posed problems for small towns and big cities alike, including New York. Parts of Manhattan lost power as the storm slammed into the Big Apple. Areas near Atlantic City, New Jersey, were consumed by the rising water level. Amid the disaster, however, Americans came together to help family, friends, and neighbors. First responders navigated dangerous conditions to rescue individuals in need. Other citizens answered the call to lend a helping hand. State and local governments took a leading role to prepare their communities for the disaster and mobilize once the storm hit. The American Red Cross initially mobilized more than 1,000 disaster workers in communities up and down the East Coast. Local Red Cross chapters provided shelters for those in need of housing.[2] Meanwhile, the Salvation Army deployed dozens of mobile feeding units in seven states to serve thousands of meals. The organization worked with local emergency management officials to determine where help was needed most.[3] In addition to the Red Cross and Salvation Army, local faith-based and community organizations played vital roles in the emergency response to Sandy.[4] Sandy was certainly a severe storm that will not soon be forgotten. Fortunately, America is still a resilient nation. Disaster Response In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the federal government responded by doling out more than $60 billion in total emergency spending, an appropriation process driven strongly by politics. Part of the problem driving the need for emergency spending is the increasing volume of disaster declarations issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over the past two decades. Each declaration issued by FEMA drains the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), a fund intended for emergencies that overwhelm state resources.[5] The more declarations issued, the faster the DRF needs replenishing. If FEMA reserved the DRF and its resources for nationally catastrophic disasters, the need for emergency spending would drop significantly. The pace of FEMA declarations has increased with each new President. In just eight years, President George W. Bush issued nearly as many FEMA declarations as Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton combined. In 2011 alone, President Obama issued more FEMA declarations than President Reagan did in eight years and President George H. W. Bush in four years. Is it any surprise that the DRF keeps running out of funds, thereby requiring emergency appropriations? The increase in disaster declarations is largely a result of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988 (Stafford Act), the controlling federal statute for disasters. Under this act, the federal government pays 75 percent to 100 percent of disaster response bills as long as FEMA has issued a disaster declaration. Meeting the requirements for such a declaration is relatively easy: The disaster in question must be “of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and the affected local governments and that Federal assistance is necessary.”[6] The financial threshold is also low: “when a state’s storm-related damages reach $1.29 per capita, [which] for several states...is less than $1 million in damages.”[7] The ambiguous provisions of the Stafford Act and low damages threshold create enormous incentives for governors to seek federal disaster declarations rather than shoulder most of the cost, especially during this time of tight state budgets. When the influence of 24-hour news channels carrying images of suffering citizens is married with politicians eager to squeeze as much out of the federal government as possible, the ability of fiscally responsible politicians to stem the tide of more spending is washed away like the houses built too near the unpredictable ocean. In order to prevent this situation from continuing in the future, Congress should: Modify the Stafford Act to establish clear requirements that limit the situations in which FEMA can issue declarations. As the litmus test for federal disaster dollars, the Stafford Act fails to clearly establish which disasters meet the federal requirements and which do not. Congress should correct this ambiguity by establishing clear requirements that limit the types of situations in which declarations can be issued. This should include eliminating some types of disasters entirely from FEMA’s portfolio. One way to accomplish this is to align declarations with the various scales used for disasters (such as the Saffir–Simpson Scale, the Richter Scale, and the Fujita Scale). Another way is to raise the minimum-dollar threshold for requesting disaster declarations. Doubling the per capita threshold to a minimum of $5 million (and a maximum threshold of $50 million) would significantly reduce the number of events that would warrant a federal disaster declaration. FEMA’s Operational Tempo and Lack of Preparedness Nothing typifies the extent to which states rely on the federal government for disaster spending like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s (R) demand that the federal government essentially give him a blank check to deal with Hurricane Sandy.[8] With his charge that Congress’s refusal to give him that blank check was a “dereliction of duty,” Governor Christie fails to appreciate that Congress has an obligation to ensure that precious taxpayers funds are appropriated responsibly. In some ways, it is hard to criticize Governor Christie too much for his expectation that the federal government should pick up the tab for Hurricane Sandy. He has watched for years as FEMA paid for disasters all over America that were far less damaging than what New Jersey experienced after Hurricane Sandy. He understandably believed it was his state’s turn to receive FEMA’s largesse. Governor Christie’s position reveals, however, just how dependent states have become on federal funding. Indeed, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) demonstrated this dependence, as well. The fact is that neither New Jersey nor New York has a disaster relief fund. After two decades of an increasingly active and generous FEMA, governors have slashed preparedness budgets and drained any disaster rainy day funds over the past 13 years. If FEMA will pick up the tab, why should governors not spend their tax funds elsewhere, particularly during tough economic times?[9 ] Yet, with the federal government’s increasing fiscal crisis, including the $17 trillion national debt, the ability of FEMA to continue to pay for routine disasters across the United States will become harder to justify. That means that states must begin planning for disasters as they once did from 1787 to 1992, before federal disaster declarations skyrocketed. The first step is for states to allocate money to disaster relief funds that will give them the ability to fund their own disaster response and recovery operations directly. Without a return of responsibility to the states, the federalization of routine disasters will continue to require FEMA to become involved with a new disaster somewhere in the United States at the current pace of every 2.5 days. This high operational tempo is affecting FEMA’s overall preparedness because it keeps FEMA perpetually in a response mode, leaving little time and few resources for catastrophic preparedness. Hurricane Sandy illustrated this problem once again. With Staten Island left to its own devices without federal assistance for several days, people began to criticize FEMA’s response.[10] Across the river in New Jersey, residents complained about FEMA’s lack of communication.[11] One FEMA worker described “a chaotic scene at New Jersey’s Fort Dix, where emergency workers arrived as the storm bore down.… [T]he worker said officials at the staging area were unprepared and told the incoming responders there was nothing for them to do for nearly four days.”[12] Michael Byrne, a FEMA federal coordinating officer acknowledged: “I’m not going to say we couldn’t have done better.”[13] One responder said, “I worked in Katrina, and Katrina was run better than Sandy.”[14] New Yorkers referred to President Obama’s promise to reduce FEMA’s red tape as little more than “hot air.”[15] Three months later, many victims of Hurricane Sandy, still in “tent cities or living in homes without power, heat or running water,” were hit again by the arctic cold that swept into the New York area at the end of January[16]—and were left trying to navigate the legendary FEMA bureaucracy to receive housing assistance.[17] For those in FEMA-provided temporary housing, the constant uncertainty surrounding the provision of assistance underscored the failure of FEMA to develop a long-term housing program for disasters like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.[18] Even FEMA’s most recent program, the Rapid Repairs program “aimed at getting victims back home quickly,” is riddled with communication errors, failure to follow up with victims, and widespread disorganization.[19] ByJanuary, one couple had waited “since mid-November for electrical work and a hot water heater.”[20] The wife had been going to the Rapid Repairs’ offices every day to find out when the workers would come to her home. She also made dozens of calls, chased contractors’ trucks through her neighborhood on foot and by car, and one time even tried to block them with her car in order to force a conversation. The final straw came when she met a Rapid Repairs’ worker looking for a nearby home that is only occupied in the summer.[21] Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (R) said that FEMA’s response after Hurricane Sandy was “as bad as Katrina.”[22] Representative Jerrold Nadler (D–NY) “told the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that FEMA is not prepared to respond effectively to disasters, especially in urban areas.”[23] Beyond the short-term issues, as documented by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), FEMA’s track record on long-term recovery efforts is spotty, at best.[24] As highlighted by the GAO, the key requirements for successful long-term recovery are: Clearly defined recovery roles and responsibilities; Effective coordination and collaboration among recovery stakeholders; and As FEMA and the state leaderships of New Jersey and New York continue their shift to long-term recovery, fulfilling these key requirements must be the primary focus of the political leadership and their staffs. Otherwise, finite resources will continue to be expended inefficiently and ineffectively. The fact is that FEMA spends too much time responding to routine natural disasters, such as small-scale tornadoes and snowstorms, and not enough time preparing for catastrophic natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, which have wide regional impacts. This increases the likelihood that the federal response to catastrophic events will be insufficient, as once again demonstrated by the response to Hurricane Sandy. In order to reverse this trend: Congress should reduce the federal share for all FEMA declarations to a maximum of 25 percent of the costs. This way at least three-fourths of the costs of a disaster are borne by the taxpayers living in the state or states where the disaster took place. For catastrophes with a nationwide or regional impact—such as 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina—a relief provision could provide a higher federal cost-share if the total costs of the disaster exceed a certain threshold. The Role of the National Guard and Coast Guard FEMA’s operational tempo and lack of preparedness can be contrasted with that of the National Guard and Coast Guard before and after Sandy made landfall. Leading up to the storm’s arrival, the National Guard mobilized with great efficiency and competence. Through the use of relatively new command structures, streamlining direction and information gathering, and use of specialized units, the National Guard, in conjunction with other state forces as well as active duty military personnel, was poised to respond to Hurricane Sandy well in advance. Having learned in recent catastrophes, such as Hurricane Katrina, the value of “dual-status commanders”—generals that can have both state and federal authority—they were appointed by the governors of Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, and New Jersey prior to Sandy’s landfall. This structure employs commanders who “have been trained to preserve the two separate chains of command of federal and state forces, helping to coordinate troops and reduce redundancies.”[26] The initiative for dual-status commanders emerged after insufficient direction and coordination between state and federal forces during Hurricane Katrina hampered response efforts. In Katrina, active duty and National Guard operations, even those that were seemingly identical in practice, were directed by two separate chains of command. The dual-status structure of the National Guard during Hurricane Sandy, however, enabled state and federal military responders to receive the instructions from the same personnel and operate in a more streamlined fashion. This command structure, as well as the general state of readiness of the National Guard, allowed it to put 60,000 guardsmen on alert status nationwide as Hurricane Sandy approached the U.S. However, due to the nature of the incident, and the evidently robust state force responses from New York and New Jersey, only 12,000 of the 60,000 guard personnel were activated for Hurricane Sandy. Operations performed by the guard included search and rescue on land (the Coast Guard operates search and rescue at sea), food and water distribution, debris removal and route clearance, traffic control, fuel distribution for response vehicles, power generation support, and assistance in maintaining civil order. In Massachusetts, for example, a National Guard Civil Support Team (CST), a unit for emergency preparedness support, was activated to respond to a possible hazardous material threat, but local response forces determined that they had control of the situation.[27] CSTs do not solely respond to hazardous material threats, however. Indeed, the New Jersey National Guard’s 21st CST was deployed to Brick Township, New Jersey, during the incident to enhance the local responders’ communications systems.[28] This type of support illustrates a critical benefit provided by CSTs. These teams have resources not necessarily available in local regions threatened by a storm, but work under the direction of the governors. In the case of the New Jersey 21st CST, the guard implemented a Joint Incident Site Communications Capability (JISCC).[29] The JISCC essentially creates a command and control center by which federal, state, and local forces can all communicate with each other regardless of which devices they employ to do so. This enables response efforts to run more efficiently as the JISCC quickly establishes a chain of command and enables the various capabilities to work in concert. Overall, the National Guard has proven to be a robust amplifier of local response efforts by virtue of its consistently trained force and federal funding stream. Yet the guard does not have access to unlimited resources. While the Administration has said that the recent round of defense cuts will not lower the number of personnel in the guard or affect guardsmen’s compensation or benefits, secondary effects could be felt in the future. Much of the equipment that the guard uses, for example, could be subject to improper modernization. Like the National Guard, the Coast Guard also served a number of critical roles in restoring order and security during and after Hurricane Sandy. Most notably, the Coast Guard was responsible for rescuing 14 people stranded aboard the distressed HMS Bounty, a tall ship replica that was caught in the storm off the coast of North Carolina. This rescue mission exemplified the Coast Guard’s use of various assets performing roles in concert, including an HC-130J airplane keeping watch, MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters conducting search and rescue missions, and Coast Guard Cutters Elm and Gallatin, which assisted in the search for missing crew members.[30] The Coast Guard’s medium-endurance cutter Spencer served as a command center in New York and New Jersey waters.[31] This cutter coordinated actions between U.S. Navy vessels and the Coast Guard cutter Willow. The Navy supported Coast Guard efforts, such as conducting hydrographic surveys to assess damage, resupplying Coast Guard vessels that were maintaining aids to navigation, and clearing debris. While the Spencer, Willow, Elm, and Gallatin performed admirably during Sandy, these cutters cannot remain in the fleet forever. The Coast Guard is currently planning a comprehensive recapitalization of its fleet. This includes the nascent “offshore patrol cutter” class, which will replace all medium-endurance cutters. Congress should continue to make sure that this and other modernization programs mature consistently and efficiently to ensure that the fleet remains capable and competent in future disaster relief. Specifically: Congress and the Administration should modernize the Coast Guard fleet. The Coast Guard’s aging fleet can no longer keep up with the increased mission-set of the service, including disaster response and recovery. Maintenance and repair is not enough to keep these assets operational. Instead, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should work with Congress to fully dedicate the resources needed to complete the development of the National Security Cutter, the Offshore Patrol Cutter, and the Fast Response Cutter fleets, and meet stated requirement levels. At the same time: The National Guard should continue building on lessons learned from Sandy and previous natural disasters. Continuing to understand how the National Guard transitions between state and federal duty is vital to maintaining the guard’s success as a response force in the future. Governors should embrace the National Guard’s dual-status command structure. Since the guard’s structure was generally successful in making response efforts more efficient and defined, governors affected by future incidents should feel encouraged in its use. Community-Based Planning and Communication “Do no harm”—a simple concept. When it comes to preparing for disasters like Hurricane Sandy, it takes on profound importance. Whether it is the individual, family, community organizations, or the private sector, the primary role is to do no harm. What does this statement mean exactly? It means that the system cannot erode the ability of people to first take care of themselves, so that first responders can focus on those who are endangered, injured, and cannot care for themselves. Nothing can be more detrimental to the response to a catastrophe than if first responders must waste vital time and resources taking care of those who could have taken care of themselves. Every community has individuals who collectively form a sizable vulnerable population. Typically, the vulnerable population consists of the mentally and physically disabled, the elderly, non-English-speaking immigrants, and children. As was demonstrated during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, a society fails when it fails those most in need. Once all elements of the community that are capable of doing so have taken care of themselves, then, and only then, can those elements engage with first responders to lend a hand and become part of the broader community response. As the 9/11 Commission noted, “The ‘first’ first responders on 9/11, as in most catastrophes, were private-sector civilians. Because 85 percent of our nation’s critical infrastructure is controlled not by government but by the private sector, private-sector civilians are likely to be the first responders in any future catastrophes.”[32] It is the person whose family is safe and secure who is able to volunteer at a disaster relief center. It is a not-for-profit community food bank whose supplies are protected that can resume its delivery of meals to those who cannot leave their homes. It is the big-box retailer whose employees are accounted for and whose stores are assessed for damage that can donate bottled water and clothing to the victims of a disaster and reopen rapidly to serve its battered community. Americans must, however, take a more realistic and pragmatic view on which actions community members should take based on the likelihood of various risks they may face. Many Americans struggle to meet their basic needs, particularly during tough economic times. For most businesses, money spent on preparing for disasters directly impacts their profits. Given these competing needs for individuals and businesses, it becomes even more critical to assess risk realistically. When it comes to natural disasters, geography largely determines the relative risk to a community. Over the past 57 years, FEMA has compiled data on all of the larger natural disasters that have occurred in the United States. The information is publicly available, searchable by state or year, and contains details, such as impacted counties, and news articles related to the disaster. Community members can use this actuarial data to develop a better understanding of the natural disasters likely to occur in their area and, therefore, make better decisions about how to prepare. One of the biggest issues arising after Hurricane Sandy was that many individuals who failed to evacuate did not have enough supplies on hand to survive[33] It did not help that, as was the case during Hurricane Katrina, the evacuation order for New York City came very late in the process. As a result, many of the 375,000 residents in the most flood-prone areas in New York City did not evacuate.[34] While many people rely on the Internet for information, the best method for conveying information to individuals is through a trusted community actor, such as a popular news personality or community leader. The information communicated should be as specific as possible and tailored to the particular disaster. With individuals taking action to prepare themselves and their families, and engaging in community-based efforts so that the ‘‘do no harm’’ principle is followed, a community’s resiliency will be high. As Hurricane Sandy showed, America’s communities are far from prepared to deal with the major events. That needs to change. Notably, Congress and the Administration should work to: Change the current American mindset of disaster response and relief from overfederalization to civil society. President Obama said it well: “But no matter how much money we invest or how sensibly we design our policies, the change that Americans are looking for will not come from government alone. There is a force for good greater than government. It is an expression of faith, this yearning to give back, this hungering for a purpose larger than our own, that reveals itself not simply in places of worship, but in senior centers and shelters, schools and hospitals, and any place an American decides.” [35] This includes in the aftermath of a disaster. Unfortunately, politicians often feel that they and the federal government must be seen in control after a disaster, even if government control is ultimately detrimental to true relief. Instead of merely paying lip service to the importance of civil society, U.S. leaders should realize that in both short-term and long-term disaster relief efforts, civil society organizations are powerful assets, and that a government-centric approach fails to use these assets to their fullest. State Defense Forces in Disaster Response Like the National Guard, State Defense Forces (SDFs) played an important role in the response to Hurricane Sandy. Unlike the National Guard, however, these forces are largely made up of volunteers from local and state communities and are often composed of retired service members and reservists, along with other professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers, seeking to give back. Many members, therefore, have high levels of training and professionalism stemming from past experience that makes them invaluable for high-risk states, acting as force multipliers for response efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters or domestic attacks. SDFs also have the advantage of being from, and thus understanding, the local area and culture. Additionally, they report to the governor of the state, and are generally under the command of the adjutant general, so they do not face the legal barriers that national forces sometimes face in deploying to states. Perhaps what is most important, though, is that each state can tailor its SDF to meet specific needs. While New York needed a naval militia to assist with its homeland security needs, New Mexico, for example, can focus its SDF on state needs such as border security and forest fire response. While not authorized to deploy outside their home states except under special circumstances, SDFs in some of the hardest-hit states, such as Maryland, New York, Virginia, and Connecticut, were activated to assist in the Sandy recovery efforts. As with the National Guard, many more militia troops were prepared and ready to serve their communities than were actually needed, but this is exactly the problem a state would want to have during a crisis. The Maryland Defense Force (MDDF) deployed one Disaster Assessment Team (DAT) in Salisbury ahead of the storm, and had two more DATs and four medical teams on standby that were never required to activate. The MDDF 121st Engineer Regiment was deployed to Salisbury as well as a medical team from the MDDF 10th Medical Regiment, which assisted a Maryland National Guard transportation team. Other MDDF personnel served in support roles at the State Emergency Operations Center and the Joint Operations Center at Camp Fretterd. Almost 70 MDDF personnel contributed 2,430 man hours to recovery efforts in the state of Maryland. Brigadier General (MDDF) Brian R. Kelm, Commander of the MDDF, recalled: “We were in place and ready to provide whatever support we could to our fellow citizens.… Although we dodged a major bullet, our personnel answered the call and served with pride and professionalism.”[36] Farther north in some of the hardest-hit areas, the New York Guard (NYG) maintained a 24/7 presence for at least three months after the storm. Its coordination in providing generators, light towers, fork lifts, cables, and other heavy operating materials out of Citi Field ballpark in Queens prevented immeasurable potential damages and losses for the state. There was no system for keeping track of all of this state-owned and leased equipment used for the response effort before activation of the NYG. George Gibson, Deputy Incident Commander of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services for Citi Field operations, stated: “I can’t begin to come up with a number of what our possible losses could have been without this system. Their work has truly kept us ahead.”[37] The New York Naval Militia also assisted the Coast Guard with six patrol boats in New York Harbor. Other states should take note: Governors of high-risk states should promote the creation of SDFs. Presently, 28 states have chosen not to authorize an SDF, including several states at high risk of natural disasters or terror attacks. The hesitation of many states to create an SDF makes little sense, given that SDFs offer near-zero-cost force multipliers for homeland security. There are, as outlined in this Special Report, a number of vibrant SDFs that can serve as models for new ones throughout the states, and whose command and staff elements could act as valuable advisers in the start-up process. State and federal policymakers should integrate SDF units into state and federal emergency management planning. States, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security should integrate SDFs into existing and future emergency management plans to ensure that all players in state emergency response are aware of the resources provided by each state’s SDF. Further, emergency management plans and exercises will provide the SDF with greater guidance on its role in state response in the event of a disaster. It is essential that all SDF personnel be drilled in National Incident Management System–Incident Command System (NIMS–ICS) protocols upon entry into service—and on a continuing basis. NGOs and the Private Sector: Vital Partners in Response and Recovery Another key lesson that can be learned from Hurricane Sandy is the importance of a vibrant civil society to disaster relief efforts. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), faith-based organizations and churches, and businesses all play roles that governments cannot fulfill on their own. Due to the bureaucratic nature of government responses, these organizations play a crucial role in reaching out to the victims of disaster in a rapid, responsive, and adaptive manner. Furthermore, these organizations are often not only the first responders, but they are also central to long-term relief and rebuilding efforts. Nongovernmental organizations such as the American Red Cross, United Way, New York Cares, and countless others quickly responded to the needs of those affected. Local volunteers like “Safety Sue” Marticek from the Red Cross could be found across the region doing what they could in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Safety Sue managed 340 residents in a New Jersey evacuation shelter, while the Red Cross as a whole housed 11,000 people in 258 shelters across 16 states on the day Sandy hit.[38] With already existing infrastructure and individuals found throughout the U.S., these NGOs met the needs of individuals across the U.S., often spearheading relief efforts in connection with other groups and governments. Similarly, churches and faith-based organizations have a unique role to play in disaster relief. Religious organizations are knit into their local communities, while also being part of a regional or national group of like-minded adherents. As such, religious organizations already have the local knowledge and infrastructure needed to respond immediately as well as having the backing of their larger religious denomination which can provide resources and personnel quickly and consistently. For example, Catholic Charities of the New York Archdiocese was organizing volunteer efforts within two days of Sandy.[39] The Mormon congregations of Washington, D.C., sent 2,500 boxes of clothes and supplies to the affected areas within days of the disaster. Nondenominational organizations, such as the Salvation Army, provided over 1.5 million meals and drinks as well as blankets and other supplies to the victims at dozens of locations across the affected area within one week of the storm.[40] In addition to physical relief, religious organizations also meet the spiritual and psychological needs of those who have experienced great loss. When dealing with the loss of homes, friends, and family, known and respected clergy are often viewed as the best source of counsel and advice. Faith-based organizations can similarly meet the needs of local firefighters, police, medical officials, and other caregivers, ensuring they are able to undertake other relief efforts. Heroism and generosity from individuals, NGOs, and religious organizations indicate all too clearly the importance of civil society in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Any disaster response must include such organizations, since they are often the greatest source of relief in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. And, with roots in local communities, these organizations are not there merely to provide relief, but also to rebuild. NGOs, such as the United Way and the Red Cross, for example, were also invested in the long-term relief effort. Both organizations are still working to meet the ongoing material needs of Sandy’s victims. The United Way has collaborated with organizations, including MTV and NBC, to continue to bring attention to the needs of ravaged communities. The United Way Hurricane Sandy Recovery Fund continues to provide essential supplies to those affected by Sandy. Similarly, the American Red Cross has worked to support the immediate needs of those affected, and had provided a total of over 17 million meals and snacks as of April 25.[41] The Red Cross also continues to provide housing assistance, financial guidance, and emotional and physical health consultations.[42] Supported by donations and volunteers, these organizations and others like them show how a vibrant civil society can do far more than a government in long-term restoration efforts after a disaster. NGOs alone, of course, cannot restore a community after a catastrophic disaster. Perhaps one of the most important elements to restoring a community after a disaster is ensuring business involvement. Indeed, Johnson & Johnson, American Express, Home Depot, and countless other companies donated over $140 million in funds and materials within two months of Hurricane Sandy.[43] Additionally, businesses play a crucial role in returning communities to normalcy. Businesses provide services and goods that communities need to operate. While basic supplies can be provided by government and nonprofits in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, only businesses can efficiently meet the various needs and demands of a community. Grocery stores, construction companies, and gas stations are just a few important examples. Along with selling critical goods and services, businesses also provide jobs, without which no community would ever recover. Employment allows individuals and families to return to their communities and rebuild what they have lost. Businesses also provide the necessary capital and expertise to repair damaged critical infrastructure networks. Energy, information technology, communications, and other sectors of critical infrastructure are largely owned by the private sector. This infrastructure must be rebuilt for true recovery to begin, and only the private sector has the resources and capability to make that happen. Instead of stimulus spending, the government can encourage these investments by suspending and streamlining unnecessary regulations following a disaster. By rebuilding infrastructure, employing local residents, and selling goods and services, businesses are instrumental in the long-term rebuilding efforts and must be integrated into government recovery plans. In order to best leverage the cooperation of these vital partners in future disasters, the government should: Incorporate NGOs, faith-based organizations, and businesses into federal and local disaster plans before disaster strikes. While President Obama created the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, and continued the Department of Homeland Security’s Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, these offices need to be leveraged more. Specifically, the roles, responsibilities, and resources of all stakeholders need to be established before a disaster strikes. These offices, together with state and local agencies, should work closely with civil society organizations to create disaster response plans that assign roles and responsibilities to best take advantage of all the resources and capabilities that civil society possesses. Reduce and streamline regulations after a disaster to encourage investment and rebuilding. While some regulations have legitimate functions in maintaining safety, others hold back rebuilding efforts by hamstringing businesses, NGOs, and other agencies with various restrictions and litigation. After a disaster, the government should make it easier for homes, businesses, and infrastructure to be rebuilt by temporarily suspending requirements like those in the Davis–Bacon statute, which effectively mandates wage premiums for those hired to work on federal construction projects. Additionally, Congress should repeal or waive environmental regulations that allow various environmental organizations to block or delay rebuilding efforts or much-needed improvements that could help mitigate disasters in the future. Similarly, financial regulations that prevent businesses and individuals from obtaining resources or investing in improvements should be suspended or repealed. Politics of Disaster Pork in the Hurricane Sandy Relief Bill. It is quite clear from the emergency spending doled out after both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy that the absolute worst time for Congress to appropriate funds is right after a disaster has occurred. The decision to appropriate additional funds is driven almost entirely by politics, not by good public policy. The result of such rash spending decisions is widespread waste, fraud, and abuse, as evidenced by Inspector General reports on FEMA’s disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts and studies of the response to Hurricane Katrina.[44] Indeed, as previously reported by The Heritage Foundation: “Fraud related to Hurricane Katrina spending is estimated to top $2 billion. In addition, debit cards provided to hurricane victims were used to pay for Caribbean vacations, NFL tickets, Dom Perignon champagne, ‘Girls Gone Wild’ videos, and at least one sex change operation.”[45] Regarding Hurricane Sandy, President Obama made an initial request of $60.4 billion. The vast majority of the requested “emergency” spending involved mitigation for future events, replacement of damaged federal assets or facilities, and good old-fashioned pork barrel spending, including: $200 million for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to be used at the discretion of the Secretary; $15 billion for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Development Block Grants; and Despite weeks of handwringing, Congress gave President Obama virtually every dollar he asked for with no offset.[47] The final coup de grace, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is that a majority of the appropriated funds will not be spent until after 2015.[48] The world’s second-largest reinsurer, Swiss Re, reported that Hurricane Sandy “accounted for $35 billion of insured losses.”[49] For perspective: The disaster relief package approved by Congress allocated over $60 billion, nearly twice as much as the entire privately insured payment. This is the kind of spending that helps unravel coherent budgeting and contributes to chronic trillion-dollar deficits. It also lures states and localities into greater dependence on federal funds, further undermining the principle of federalism. It does not by any stretch meet the test of “emergency” or “disaster” spending, nor will the majority of the funds go to help the states, localities, businesses, and individuals directly affected by the disaster to rebuild.[50] In the future: Congress should enact legislation that restricts the items for which the federal government can provide emergency funds post-disaster. With this restriction on the federal government’s appetite to engage in emergency spending, Americans should see a bit more responsible treatment of their tax dollars. Permissible items include disaster relief for registered and validated victims; debris removal; food, shelter, and other necessary supplies for disaster victims; and other direct aid to victims. Impermissible items include mitigation projects; repair or replacement of federal assets or facilities; and spending for any project beyond 150 miles of the disaster area (that is, pork barrel projects). In order for Congress to fund items outside the permissible list, it would need to secure two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate. Global Warming Not to Blame. In the wake of such devastation, it is reasonable to look for a cause and explanation for suffering. Some, however, have incorrectly blamed global warming for an increase in disasters like Sandy, as well as the resulting increase in emergency declarations. The storm that hit the Northeast was an infamous combination of a hurricane and a cold front coming across Canada during high tide—a horrendous storm, but according to historical tables not an unprecedented one.[51] Science cannot yet show a connection between Hurricane Sandy (and other severe weather events) and global warming. If anything, the science seems to be saying the opposite. Although somemodels show catastrophic warming, the data does not yet do so. What the data does show is that temperatures have leveled out over the past 15 years, such that Britain’s Met Office has dramatically lowered its temperature projections.[52] Neither has there been any discernible trend correlating carbon dioxide with hurricane activity over the past 200 years.[53] In fact, at the time of Hurricane Sandy, America was experiencing a hurricane drought of sorts, where for seven years there had not been a hurricane greater than Category 3 to make landfall since Wilma in 2005, the longest such stretch in over one hundred years.[54] Global warming was the biggest nonstory of Hurricane Sandy. Nevertheless, politicians and pundits took advantage of Hurricane Sandy’s devastation to advance global warming policies and projects.[55] Their proclamations captured much media attention and helped mobilize the passage of a relief package laced with global warming gestures. Rather than helping people rebuild their lives, significant amounts of federal money were diverted to biofuels and wind-energy tax credits, helping no one except those in the politically favored industries.[56] Available data do not show that the Earth is approaching accelerated and catastrophic warming; but regardless, these programs have next to zero effect on the climate.[57] Though some of the billions in the Sandy relief package will reach victims, the relief bill resembles many previous legislative decisions to spend on pet projects rather than on appropriate functions of the federal government. Rather than simply throwing money at the issue, a better and more honest federal approach to global warming right now is to encourage economic health—precisely what global warming energy subsidies do not accomplish. Federal programs like cap and trade, efficiency mandates, and fuel economy standards will not significantly affect global temperature, especially considering the efforts of developing nations to provide electricity to millions of people currently without it. But these policies will adversely affect American businesses and families. Instead of diverting federal dollars to these programs, Congress should pursue greater reform within the energy sector, where much of this spending takes place. Any program or policy should be eliminated that does not provide clear environmental benefits which outweigh total cost. Economic health, not special interest subsidies and politically driven agendas introduced in the name of fighting global warming, will enable individuals to handle the effects of global warming if they become a problem.[58] Critical Infrastructure Nuclear Safety: A Non-Event. As with those who blamed global warming for Hurricane Sandy, many infrastructure concerns turned out to be misguided. Before Hurricane Sandy made landfall, nuclear skeptics and opponents were already likening the storm to the Fukushima disaster in Japan and raising alarm about flooding, power outages, and overheating spent fuel pools. However, the feared impact of Sandy on the 34 nuclear reactors in its path turned out to be a non-event. The nuclear facilities in Hurricane Sandy’s path were designed and built to withstand floods above predicted storm surges and other natural disasters long before Sandy was ever a threat. Even in the case of serious damage caused by weather, nuclear plants are built with layered safety systems to mitigate and control emergency situations. For example, should power to the reactors be significantly disrupted during a storm, reactors will automatically shut down and diesel generators will kick in to maintain safe operations and conditions. Beyond plant design, federal law also requires nuclear plants to have preparedness and emergency response plans with local, state, and federal groups approved by FEMA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) before an operating license is granted. Nuclear facilities participate in full emergency exercises with state and local first responders at least once every two years. Operators also regularly undergo training and are tested for recertification every six years. NRC resident inspectors always staff each reactor facility in America, and independent groups like the Institution of Nuclear Power Operators and the World Association of Nuclear Reactors train, evaluate, and circulate best practices.[59] Because of these preparations and routine refreshing of emergency plans, America’s nuclear reactors are among the world’s safest. The week prior to Sandy’s landfall on the evening of October 29, nuclear facilities were entirely re-inspected and tested. Parts that could be disrupted by high winds were secured or moved. Backup power generators were fully fueled and ensured as operating properly. Staff at nuclear facilities in Sandy’s path went through routine preparations for severe weather and plants were overstaffed around the clock.[60] The NRC also notified potentially affected reactors and augmented personnel at plants to verify that proper precautions were being made. Leading up to, throughout, and after the storm, operators, emergency responders, and NRC inspectors staffed the stations.[61] Before and during the storm, the NRC monitored Sandy’s progress from the Incident Response Center from its Region I office in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, as well as from the Operations Center at headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. Channels of communication were kept open with the U.S. Department of Energy which twice daily issued situation reports, keeping the public well informed.[62] As part of standard NRC policy, reactors must shut down two hours before hurricane winds are forecast to reach the plants, though operators have the prerogative to shut down the reactors earlier as a precaution. Of the 34 reactors expected to be in Sandy’s path, 18 continued to operate at 100 percent power, six reduced power output at the request of regional grid operators or in response to the storm, seven were previously shut down for refueling or maintenance, and three successfully shut down manually in response to the storm. Of those three, New York’s Nine Mile Point 1 and Indian Point 3 shut down because of grid disruption, and New Jersey’s Salem 1 shut down because rough waters battered the housing structure for several of the plant’s pumps. The safety systems of all three responded without incident.[63] One plant, Oyster Creek Generating Station, issued an “unusual event” declaration and then an “alert”—the two lowest of four emergency alert levels—during the course of the storm. As the nation’s oldest operating nuclear reactor, it became a focal point for anti-nuclear sentiment and misinformation before and after the storm. Oyster Creek had been closed since October 22 for scheduled maintenance, eliminating many of the safety concerns that faced other facilities.[64] During the storm, high waters caused a partial loss of power and several of the cooling water pumps shut down. Even then a second set of pumps continued to operate. Operating company Exelon reported, “Station employees responded quickly and appropriately to the storm’s challenges and all plant safety systems, including used fuel cooling, operated as designed.”[65] Nevertheless, the alert became a handhold for anti-nuclear activists and others to rally against nuclear power.[66] On November 13, 2012, the NRC began a special inspection of the plant’s preparation and management during the storm. Though finding several menial points for improvement (such as control room documentation), the NRC report “underscores how plant operators dealt with the harsh conditions at the water intake structure and other challenges, such as the loss of off-site power for a time.”[67] The successful weathering of Sandy is yet one more addition to the American nuclear industry’s proven track record to prepare and withstand severe weather. The year 2011 should serve as proof enough: Nuclear reactor facilities were square in the crosshairs of hundreds of tornadoes sweeping through the South in April, massive flooding in Nebraska through June and July, the unusual Virginia earthquake in August, and Hurricane Irene later that same month, all without incident.[68] Even Hurricane Katrina, the Category 5 hurricane that caused so much high-profile damage in 2005, caused no incident at Entergy’s Waterford 3 unit in Louisiana, which was double-staffed in preparation for the storm and was safely shut down.[69] Of the Atlantic states in Sandy’s path, nuclear energy provides the majority of electricity in South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Vermont and a close second in North Carolina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.[70] The nuclear facilities in these states were prepared and proved resilient against Sandy’s force. Although Hurricane Sandy damaged much of the Northeast’s coastal infrastructure, the nuclear non-event attests to what those in the industry already knew: that America has the best nuclear safety system in the world. More, however, can be done to ensure the expansion of safe nuclear energy in the U.S. As such, Congress should: Complete its review of the U.S. Department of Energy’s application to construct the used nuclear fuel repository at Yucca Mountain. Finishing the permit application as required by law would allow the nation to move forward on developing a workable nuclear waste management policy.[71] If the NRC determines that the repository does not meet safety standards, the nuclear industry can begin searching for alternatives. Should the NRC determine that the repository can be safely built and operated, however, the Department of Energy should then transfer control of the permit to a Nevada-based entity that could negotiate directly with the nuclear industry the conditions under which the repository could be built. Rather than try to fix this fundamentally flawed system, the United States needs broad reform in the area of nuclear waste management, which at its basis requires giving nuclear waste producers responsibility for nuclear waste management. Modernize the regulatory process for new nuclear power plants. Though today’s reactors are very safe, new reactors have the potential to bring Americans even safer, clean, abundant, and affordable energy. One of the obstacles to nuclear investment, however, is an antiquated system for nuclear regulations. The nation needs a regulatory system that allows the introduction of new technologies into the marketplace. By being largely capable of regulating only one reactor type, the NRC essentially blocks new technologies from competing with existing ones. The NRC needs a more neutral approach to regulation that invites more market competition. A Greater Concern: Getting the Lights Back On While uproar over the nuclear energy sector was misguided, concern over the electrical infrastructure was very realistic. Hurricanes generally cause widespread power outages, particularly in highly populated areas. Hurricane Sandy was no different. The widespread outages caused by Hurricane Sandy along the New Jersey coast and Long Island impacted all three parts of the power system—generation, transmission, and local distribution. Inland, the impact was almost entirely on the local distribution system, as wind and rain combined to down hundreds of individual power lines. As with most hurricanes, the largest cause of outages from Sandy was due to damage to distribution systems. This network of substations, transformers, and distribution lines delivers electricity to individual customers. Above-ground distribution systems are especially vulnerable to widespread outages because high winds and heavy rain combine to cause branches, and often entire trees, to fall onto the lines. Even lines that are not snapped by falling branches or trees can still short-circuit when the electric line comes into contact withbranches. Moreover, in some cases, the wind and rain combine to knock down the distribution poles themselves. When a distribution line short-circuits, the sudden change in power flow can damage transformers located along the line, or at a substation. (Transformers adjust voltage to the level at which an individual business or residence can be served.) In some cases, transformers can catch fire or, in worst-case situations, explode. With this in mind, a common reaction to outages caused by hurricanes is often to call for burying distribution lines underground. Although underground distribution lines are immune to the effects of wind, undergrounding has drawbacks. In addition to the high cost, underground distribution lines are especially vulnerable to flooding. Thus, when a hurricane like Sandy causes significant flooding, underground distribution systems can suffer extensive damage. In Lower Manhattan, for example, some underground transformers flooded with corrosive sea water, rendering them nonfunctional. This was only aggravated by the fact that Hurricane Sandy made landfall at high tide, causing its particularly destructive storm surge, and resulting in even more significant flooding. For utility customers, waiting for power to be restored can be a long and frustrating experience. An individual neighborhood, for example, may be without power even though power has been restored on the next block. For utilities, restoring power requires extensive coordination and care, so as not to endanger their workers or customers. Some of the more than eight million homes that lost power as a result of Sandy remained in the dark for weeks. After a hurricane, power restoration requires clearing away debris, rebuilding distribution circuits, and replacing faulty equipment. In some cases, high-voltage transmission lines and generators may be damaged, requiring repair and replacement. Utility crews coordinate their repair efforts to restore the maximum number of customers in the least possible time, as well as giving priority to restoring power for critical users, such as hospitals. Power may not be restored in certain areas even after local repairs are completed because of the interconnected nature of the power system. The damages caused to the power grid by a hurricane are event-specific. That is, damages can vary significantly from storm to storm, depending on the storm’s characteristics. For example, had Sandy’s landfall taken place several hours later or earlier, at low tide, rather than at high tide, the storm surge and subsequent flood damage to lower Manhattan would have been much less. Because of the uniqueness of storm characteristics and damages, a standardized “one-storm-fits-all” set of recommendations to improve the reliability and resilience of the power grid is difficult. Nevertheless, utilities can implement measures to improve the resilience of the electric grid. These should be to: Promote contingency planning and training programs that help utilities respond more quickly and efficiently. Having contingency plans in place in the event of a hurricane is a low-cost, straightforward exercise. Contingency plans should encompass both short-term and long-term actions. These include: Coordinating repair crews with other utilities in advance of an approaching hurricane; Training repair crews and utility personnel to modify their responses as circumstances change. Identify and implement cost-effective improvements to the power system. Although it might be possible to build an electric system that is hurricane-proof, the cost would be prohibitive. Utilities can, however, undertake cost-effective actions to reduce potential outages and speed up power restoration in the event of catastrophic disasters, such as performing rigorous testing and analysis of aging transmission and distribution system assets to determine when various assets should be repaired or replaced, and the lowest-cost approaches for doing so. Provide a financial incentive for electric utilities to take action. Rather than identifying power system weaknesses as a means of punishing electric utilities, state utility regulators should use an incentive-based approach to reward utilities for superior performance. These approaches include: Incentives that reward utilities for improved system reliability and restoration of power to customers as quickly as possible. For example, utility performance can be benchmarked against other, similar utilities; and Incentives for improved contingency planning efforts. Incentive regulation offers utilities a balanced “carrot and stick” approach for not meeting established regulatory requirements. Such economic incentives have proven highly effective in improving overall utility reliability by allowing utilities to profit from superior performance, just as competitive firms do. There is no reason for similar incentives to not be applied to power restoration efforts. Time for Lessons to Finally Be Learned The reality is that most lessons learned from Hurricane Sandy are not new. Indeed, FEMA’s lack of preparedness will come as a surprise to no one, nor will the sometimes-tenuous nature of the U.S. electric grid. From Hurricane Katrina to the Gulf oil spill Americans have been taught these lessons before, yet the nation continues to fall short in terms of planning for catastrophic disaster response and recovery. It is time for the U.S. to stop brushing these shortfalls aside and ensure that the country is truly prepared for the next major disaster. The lessons have been taught—it is time they are learned.

26 October 2012 ICAT on Hurricane Sandy Damage Benchmarks ICAT just sent out this summary ( here in PDF) of an analysis using the ICAT Damage Estimator (based on our normalized hurricane loss database): The ICAT Damage Estimator (www.icatdamageestimator.com) can be used to obtain statistics regarding historic storms that have followed similar paths to Hurricane Sandy’s current forecast path. For this analysis, the Active Storms search feature was used to select all historic storms that have made landfall within the current range of computer model forecasts. This range includes the coastline from near the MD/VA border on the DelMarVa Peninsula to the eastern edge of Long Island, NY. The ICAT Damage Estimator shows that there have been 7 damaging tropical cyclones that have made landfall along this segment of coastline since 1900. The tool shows the storm parameters, the damage at the time of landfall, and the estimated damage if the storms were to make landfall in 2012. The 2012 damage estimations are made by “normalizing” the data by adjusting for population change, inflation, and change in wealth per capita. The most damaging storm to make landfall within the current range of computer model forecasts was the New England hurricane of 1938, which would cause an estimated ~$47B in damage today. However, this storm was a category 3 hurricane when it made landfall, while Sandy is only expected to have category 1 force winds. Of the 7 storms selected, only two made landfall as category 1 hurricanes. Hurricane Agnes of 1972 made landfall with 85 mph sustained winds near New York City and would cause an estimated $19B in damage today. Agnes initially made landfall over the FL Panhandle, then moved NE and emerged off the NC coast. As it approached New England, the storm strengthened as it underwent extratropical transition, which is also expected to occur with Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane Agnes’s impacts were felt across a very wide area of the Northeast. Hurricane Belle of 1976 also had 85 mph winds, but moved much more quickly than Agnes and was weakening as it made landfall. It is estimated that Belle would cause less than $1B in damage today. As can be seen from the storms selected by the ICAT Damage Estimator, the sample size of category 1 hurricanes making landfall along the Northeast is not very large. While Agnes appears to be the most similar to Sandy, it made landfall near New York City, which explains why the damage estimates are so high. Hurricane Irene of 2011 officially made landfall further south, but impacted a similar area that will be affected by Hurricane Sandy. That storm caused ~$7B in damage, but was not quite as strong as Sandy is expected to be. This data can be used as a benchmark to assess the range of possibilities for Sandy’s impact.

Partners The ferocious “frankenstorm” known as Sandy that ripped through greater New York City five years ago remains one for the record books. Like this year’s hurricane season, it racked up tens of billions of dollars in economic damages. Superstorm Sandy had another close, yet underappreciated, similarity to this year’s hurricanes: less affluent groups of people suffered more, both in the initial damage and recovery. An analysis by a team I led at Stony Brook University shows that Sandy’s destructive path across Long Island, from Brooklyn to the Hamptons, was not as even-handed as media coverage often made it seem, both in its initial impact and people’s recovery. The storm season of 2017 has already left behind an even more dramatic version of this story: Following Hurricane Harvey, Houston quickly switched water and electricity back on and emptied most emergency shelters. Meanwhile, several weeks after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, much of the island is still in “survival mode.” Both hurricane seasons expose the close ties between severe weather events and social inequality. Uneven impact Though no longer a hurricane when it hit the New York region, Sandy proved big and powerful enough to stir record rises in ocean levels, vying with Long Island’s worst recorded storm of 1938. While high winds brought down trees on cars, homes and power lines across the island’s interior, flooding brought the most damage. Coastline communities bore the brunt of the storm. In the wake of an onslaught that sounded “like a jet plane was landing on your street,” Rockaway resident Richard Blanck found himself up to his ankles in water on his front porch. In nearby Long Beach, “those few residents in the poor neighborhoods of town who owned cars saw them swallowed up, and disabled, by the salty water.” Farther from New York City, on Long Island, 100 Mastic Beach residents had to be rescued from flooded homes. All three of these communities, among the hardest hit by Sandy, lie along Long Island’s south shore, which has long drawn lower- as well as middle-income residents. This coastline is also more vulnerable to storms sweeping up from warmer waters. By contrast, since its early 20th-century reputation as a “Gold Coast,” the more insulated north shore remains more uniformly well-to-do and white. We looked at where people who registered significant damage with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) following Sandy lived. Mapping that data, it was clear the northern coastline was affected relatively little, compared to the south-facing and less wealthy parts of Long Island where people reported higher damage. One report three years after the storm recounted the experience of Melissa Miller in Long Beach, whose apartment in the Channel Park Homes development was inundated with five inches of sewage-infested water. Nearly every home in Long Beach was flooded, and two-thirds suffered “heavy or strong damage,” as did 20 percent of those in nearby Far Rockaways, according to state statistics. Our investigation showed her experience was shared by others in publicly subsidized homes, many of them with African-American residents. But along the southeastern and northern shorelines of Long Island, hardly any schools flooded, even in the most stricken communities. More affluent Bayville, in northern Nassau, suffered an 11-foot storm surge, but its schools, situated on higher, dryer ground, lay out of harm’s way. Less well-off white communities like Coney Island suffered too, and not just from flooding. Breezy Point, for instance, lost 10 percent of its housing, 135 homes from an electrical fire as well as 220 from the flood. Eastward along the south shore, from Nassau out through Suffolk counties, we found that wealthier communities weathered Sandy’s waves better than poorer ones such as Mastic Beach. Mastic Beach, in red, suffered worse damage than Westhampton just to its east because there is denser housing stock and because Mastic Beach has struggled to pass zoning codes to guide and limit residential development in low-lying areas, which makes it harder to withstand flood waters. Clearly Westhampton Beach’s lesser vulnerability did not just stem from its higher ground. Westhampton Beach has lower housing density compared to Mastic Beach and longstanding zoning for residential buildings, making this and other affluent areas better able to withstand and absorb floodwaters. Even before Sandy, Westhampton Beach had also long pushed to preserve dunes and other topography to mitigate surges from Sandy and other storms. Still waiting If disadvantaged residents and communities suffered more from the storm’s initial blow, they also faced greater obstacles in the struggle to repair or rebuild. In a better-off north shore town like Bayville, 86 percent of those with severely damaged homes had flood insurance, nearly three times more than the 30 percent in Coney Island/Brighton Beach. Further drilling into FEMA data showed that in damaged areas of Brooklyn with predominantly African-American residents, only 14 percent of homeowners were insured. Those without insurance had to await FEMA or New York state grants, which often took years to arrive. Recovery for people in lower socioeconomic groups of Long Island has been slower than people in more well-off neighborhoods.AP Photo/Mark Lennihan Over the last five years, FEMA as well as New York Rising, the state’s rehabilitation program, have accomplished much across the island, but also frustrated many Sandy victims with the slowness and paltriness of their aid. That only two-thirds of homeowners in New York Rising have completed their repairs five years after the storm also means that a third have not. And while Bayville was beginning its third phase of rebuilding in 2016, those in Long Beach’s Channel Park Homes still awaited adequate repairs by the city housing authority. As reported by the group ERASE Racism, Melissa Miller had received only a new refrigerator and some replacement drywall, along with a “sanitizing” that still left her apartment with a nauseating smell. Parallels in Harvey and Maria Sandy left a plethora of destruction in its wake, from its 147 deaths to approximately US$65 billion in damages. It also exposed vulnerabilities that were much longer in coming: communities in low-lying areas lacking sufficient infrastructure and insurance for its floods. We’ve seen this general pattern play out this year as well. As with Hurricanes Irma and Jose – and with a majority of the American citizens in a Hurricane Maria-stricken Puerto Rico – less well-off communities have already shouldered the severest burdens, whether because of lower incomes or racio-ethnic origins or both. Now more than ever, we need a nationwide conversation on ways our coastal landscapes have developed so that our most vulnerable citizens are now at greater risk from such massive storms. Officials need to find more reliable ways of illuminating problems faced by the less advantaged, and to ensure these are addressed as quickly and effectively as those of the better-off. What Sandy’s inequalities show is that around America’s largest metropolis as much as in other corners of our nation and planet, the battle against global warming is also a battle for environmental justice.
Social Good FarmVille-Inspired Game Helps Repair Hurricane Sandy Damage Rebuilding after October 2012's Hurricane Sandy, one of the costliest and deadliest storms in U.S. history, is far from complete. To help the people whose homes were destroyed in one of the most hard-hit communities, digital agency Mother has partnered with Zynga to gamify reconstruction in a digital experience called Repair the Rockaways. "There's a media cycle that begins and ends, but the story goes on with Sandy, even if it's not generating lots of hits because there's a new story in the spotlight," Tom Webster, Mother creative director, told Mashable. In a web simulation you may recognize from playing FarmVille, you can buy bricks to build houses in the game. While paying for FarmVille bricks goes to Zynga, 100% of the cost of Repair the Rockaways bricks goes toward buying supplies, materials and labor to rebuild the destroyed homes in Rockaway, New York. The amount of bricks you receive corresponds to the size of your donation, which you will see transform the empty community, modeled after the peninsular neighborhood in Queens, to populate with houses. For every donation of $100 or more, you'll receive a set of Kapla blocks, as a memento of the rebuilding you're helping facilitate in the Rockaways. You can opt to give them to a school in the area, if you'd prefer not to keep them yourself. There's also a call to action at the end of the experience, in the short film made by Respond and Rebuild. Eventually, different videos will be added to the game (you'll be notified via email with future updates), so you can follow the continuing narrative as the community rebuilds. "We've integrated the news into the experience. If you are being touched by this and you care enough to donate, the next thing to do is to donate again," Webster said. "There's the potential to donate up to $200,000 through brick sales."

Hurricane Sandy Roundup: Gas Rationing Continues, Fatty Sandy Meals It's now been three weeks since Hurricane Sandy pummeled the city with storm surges and massive flooding, leaving behind widespread power outages, transit woes, housing destruction and more problems we're going to be dealing with for a long time to come. Below, check out a roundup of the latest Sandy-related news, including another week of gas rationing, a look at some destroyed landmarks, and fatty MREs being given out to victims. Mayor Bloomberg announced that gas rationing will continue throughout the city until at least Thursday. "The odd-even license plate system has worked well and helped to reduce wait times and lines at the pump," Bloomberg said, adding he wanted to "ensure we do not risk going back to the extreme lines we saw prior to the system being implemented." As many as 250K cars were damaged during Sandy, and drivers are trying to figure out what to do now. "We have heard from dealers in the area that there is a growing need for people to replace damaged cars," David Hyatt, spokesman for the national dealers' trade group, told the Journal. "There has been an uptick in interest in new vehicles." Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the Rockaways, and called the conditions at certain NYCHA housing "distressing:" “There are little children eating on the floor and breathing in mold. This is the first place I’ve been where there are no resources,” said Kennedy. An underground vault owned by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. was flooded during Sandy, damaging 1.3 million bond and stock certificates—which means $70 billion in bearer bonds could be in jeopardy. The Post points out several NYC landmarks, areas and icons that were seriously damaged during Sandy, including the Old Orchard Shoal Lighthouse, Green-Wood Cemetery’s Angel and The Shore Theater sign in Coney Island.

Hurricane Sandy vs. Hurricane Katrina Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo made headlines and raised eyebrows Monday when he said that while Hurricane Katrina was deadlier than Hurricane Sandy, the latter storm was “more impactful” over all and “affected many, many more people and places than Katrina.” Photo Mr. Cuomo added that Hurricane Sandy had a greater economic impact, destroyed or damaged more units of housing, affected more businesses and caused more customers to lose power. Here are the statistics he backed that up with. For our part, City Room decided to undertake a little truth-squadding. While apples-to-apples numbers for the two storms are very difficult to come by, especially given that Hurricane Sandy’s costs are still being tallied, here are our findings.

Tidal gauge at The Battery showing the storm surge (green) lining up perfectly with the high tide (blue) to produce a massive storm tide (red) – National Data Buoy Center, NOAA. Also note that pressure bottomed out just above 960mb. A site at Sandy Hook, NJ stopped reporting before the peak storm surge/tide. Heavy rain combined with the storm tide on the Chesapeake and Delaware bays caused flooding in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The storm tide travelled up the Hudson river leading to record levels at Poughkeepsie. Rivers are still rising in response to the heavy rains from the storm still flowing into them. Heavy snow and (near) blizzard conditions are occurring the central Appalachian mountains and Ohio. Storm conditions are still occurring on the Great Lakes leading to very rough lake conditions and coastal flooding where onshore winds are producing 1-3ft water level rises. Damages from this hurricane will likely be astronomical in expense, mainly from the coastal flooding and power outages. In these coastal areas, many trees still had their leaves and so tree damage, power outages, and damage to homes from falling trees was the primary form of wind damage. Tree damage, power line damage, and roof damage from the weight of the snow, which was of a high water content, were the most common form of damage where feet of snow have fallen in the mountains. Meteorologically, this storm was significant because of its rare form of interaction with an extra-tropical system, its trajectory, its record breaking low landfall pressure of 946mb, and its size. A storm like this has immense potential to cause death and destruction and that it has indeed lived up to its potential. The name Sandy will likely be retired. A far reaching outer band of Hurricane Sandy produced scattered showers, some of which moved across the island and produced a tornado in Sandy’s parish. The tornado damaged homes and businesses, blowing in doors and windows, knocking over walls and ripping up a section of roofing. Squally showers are in the forecast until Sandy pulls further away from the island. Hurricane Sandy has top winds of 75mph, and although Sandy is expected to pass more than 300miles away from Bermuda, its extreme outer bands may produce tropical storm force winds, downpours, and tornadoes. The Bermuda Weather Service today investigated the damage and determined that it was indeed a tornado and that it was an F1 tornado on the Fujita Scale. An F1 tornado has winds between 73 and 112mph and produces minor damage. Tornadoes are not uncommon in tropical cyclones, especially to the right of the track. Tornadoes are not unheard of in Bermuda including ones that formed in Hurricanes. To understand why Bermuda sees so few tornadoes, think of Bermuda as a small target, and a tornado as an even smaller projectile – its gonna be hard for one to hit Bermuda. Tropical storm conditions are possible tonight and tropical storm warnings are in effect. Remember, tornadoes are always possible in tropical cyclones and so the threat for more will be there until Hurricane Sandy pulls away sometime around Monday evening. Sandy’s forecast track has changed little over the last day. The hurricane is expected to continue northeast or north-northeastwards today. A turn to the north should commence this evening or tonight, and a turn to the northwest tomorrow morning. Landfall is expected in New Jersey Monday night. Further deepening of this system has occurred with pressures falling to 951mb. Sandy could either hold its own, or continue to deepen up until landfall. Impacts:Heavy Rain – Widespread areas of 3-8″ of rain with localized areas of >12″ of rain are likely along and to the left of this storm’s track as Sandy moves inland. This could lead to moderate-major river flooding in the Mid-Atlantic states. Near-coastal river flooding may be exacerbated by elevated tides. High Wind – Tropical Storm conditions have been reported in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and gusts over tropical storm force have been reported in Virginia. Damaging winds to hurricane force are expected to occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland to near coastal cities. Tropical Storm force/gale force winds (>39mph) are expected to occur well inland with damaging gusts over 50mph common. This could cause severe tree damage or defoliation and lead to power outages or even structural damage as far inland as southern Ontario and Quebec. Storm Surge – A storm surge of 2-5ft is occurring along the North Carolina, Virginia, and Delmarva coasts, this could increase further as Hurricane Sandy continues an onshore flow in this area. Sound-side flooding is likely also occurring in Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. In Long Island sound and in New York Harbor, expect peak storm surges of 6-11ft. Anywhere else with onshore gale force winds can expect storm surges between 4 and 8ft. These are very serious heights above mean tide level and if combined with a high tide cycle, could produce disastrous coastal flooding and damage in a highly populated area. This storm surge will be accompanied by large battering waves that could produce erosion and additional structural damage. Records for storm surge values in this region could be threatened and the infrastructure in place put to the test. On the Great Lakes, the prospect of lake length winds on Lake Michigan have prompted lake shore flood watches to be posted in Illinois and Indiana. High surf and onshore gale force winds there could cause localized lake shore flooding there, a similar threat exists for Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Heavy Snow – In the middle Appalachians in West Virginia, a combination of tropical moisture, up sloping winds, and cold air filtering in on the west side of Sandy will mix to dump heavy wet snow and bring gusty winds. Near blizzard conditions are possible here and winter storm watches are in effect calling for 1-2 feet of snow in the highest elevations above 3000feet in altitude. 2-6″ are possible below 2000feet in altitude in West Virginia. In areas where deciduous trees still have leaves, the combination of snow and winds will produce significant tree damage that could lead to power outages, the weight of the snow may even lead to some roof damage. Bermuda Weather Service radar image of a squally shower of the west end of the island that possibly produced a tornado at around 9am local time. Bermuda: Bands of showers are expected to move through tonight and tomorrow. Squally showers in these bands could contain tropical storm force winds and tornadic activity is a distinct threat here. The Bermuda Weather Service expects 35-40mph southwesterly winds with gusts to 65mph late tonight – but this could be confined to the western marine area. Elevated surf along the south shore will produce dangerous rip currents and significant beach erosion, while making it hazardous to be out on the water. Why no tropical storm/hurricane warnings for the Northeast/New England? Hurricane Sandy could transition into a post-tropical storm as it approaches. If the storm is no longer tropical, tropical storm and hurricane warnings cannot be in effect for it. In the event this happens, all warnings would have to be switched to those used for mid-latitude extra-tropical storms which could lead to confusion among the public. So to avoid confusion, they are starting warnings off as those for extra-tropical storms. East Coast view of Hurricane Sandy, GOES Imagery from NOAA. October 27th 2012. Sandy has become so large that typical floater imagery doesn’t capture the entire storm. As of 11am eastern from the National Hurricane Center: Maximum sustained winds are near 75mph Minimum central pressure is near 958mb Sandy is moving North-Northeast at about 9mph. Sandy is doing a balancing act north of the Bahamas where it is trying to deepen (lower its central pressure) and expand its wind field at the same time. Fluctuations in its maximum wind speeds have been the result, and Sandy will likely continue to be at borderline hurricane status until Sunday night when it will try to strengthen as it gets energized by its merger with the trough over the interior Eastern United States. Hurricane Sandy’s pressure fell from 969mb at 11pm last night to 958mb at 11am this morning indicating deepening. While its maximum radius of tropical storm force winds expanded from 275miles at 5pm yesterday, to 450miles at 5am this morning. All Hurricane Warnings have been discontinued for now, but tropical storm conditions are still occurring in the northernmost Bahamas, offshore of Florida and North and South Carolina where tropical storm warnings are in effect. Further advisories, watches, and warnings will be needed as Sandy approaches, potentially from North Carolina to Maine. East coast states have already declared states of emergency and some evacuation notices have been posted in advance of Sandy’s landfall which is forecast to be somewhere in New Jersey or the Delmarva peninsula. Official National Hurricane Center track for Hurricane Sandy as of 11am Eastern Time. Tropical Storm Warnings for parts of North and South Carolina and the Bahamas in blue, and Tropical Storm Watches in yellow for parts of South Carolina and Bermuda. Impacts…Heavy flooding rain over 6″ in areas is likely near the storm’s path. Areas where both storm surge and flooding rains are a threat may have the flooding exacerbated by the unusually high tides down stream. Heavy wet snow is a distinct possibility in the higher elevations of Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Significant coastal flooding is also likely in areas of onshore winds and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where storm surges are forecast to reach up to 8feet and storm tides may be extreme due to the large changes between low and high tide and the astronomical high tide with the full moon on Monday. Damaging winds (30-60mph) could extend far inland causing tree damage and potentially some power outages. Structurally damaging winds (50-75mph) could occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland. Keep in mind that tropical storm force winds (sustained at >39mph) have been observed more than 400miles from the center of this storm – so even though the storm may make landfall in New Jersey, areas as far north as Maine and as far inland as Ontario and Quebec (including Lakes Erie and Ontario) could see tropical storm conditions. Areas to the south will have offshore winds, and tropical storm force winds will extend less far from the center and will be gustier in nature. In these areas, hazardously low water levels may be observed, especially at low tide. Meanwhile, there could be a period of tropical storm conditions in Bermuda (Tropical Storm Watch) sometime between tonight and Monday night as Sandy continues to expand and passes to the distant west. Squally showers will be the theme here during that period. Hurricane Sandy over the Northwestern Bahamas with 80mph winds, the cloud pattern shows a highly sheared storm – and one that is transitioning to something more of a hybrid between tropical and extra-tropical. GOES-14 high resolution 1-minute rapid scan satellite imagery. around 12pm October 26th 2012. Hurricane Sandy has been blasting through the Bahamas with some of the Central and Northwestern islands seeing a direct hit from Sandy and hurricane conditions as a result. Overnight, high southerly and south-southwesterly wind shear commenced over the center of Sandy. This has disrupted the core structure of the hurricane and injected dry air near the center – starting its transition into a more extra-tropical structure. Meanwhile, the cleanup begins in the Caribbean islands already affected and, unfortunately, reports of death and destruction have come in from Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In total, more than 20 people have reportedly died as a result of the storm. Forecast Track… Sandy made the turn to the Northwest yesterday that had it skirt the northern Bahamas delivering hurricane conditions there. This morning, its forward speed has slowed and it has turned back to the North. Tonight, Sandy should turn more to the northeast and pick up speed in response to an approaching trough currently over the Mississippi valley. By Monday, Sandy is expected to be at the latitude of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the trough has since stalled over the interior Northeast and a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along it. This wave of low pressure will turn Sandy back to the northwest, towards the Mid-Atlantic/New England coast for a potential landfall Wednesday morning. Sandy will not be fully tropical by this time, so it will have a broad wind field and the exact location of landfall becomes less important as effects spread over three hundred miles from that point. Official National Hurricane Center Hurricane Sandy track as of 11am Eastern time October 26th 2012. Forecast Impacts… The Bahamas…Hurricane conditions will subside in the northernmost islands of the Bahamas this afternoon, and tropical storm conditions should subside by Saturday afternoon. Storm surges of 3-5feet are occurring in areas of onshore winds while rainfall totals of 1-4″ are expected. Winds have likely reached near 80mph on eastern parts of Grand Bahama island and most of Little Abaco. Hurricane warnings are in effect for these islands and tropical storm warnings are in effect for the rest of the Northwest Bahamas. Florida…Tropical storm warnings are in effect along much of the East coast of Florida. Tropical storm conditions are occurring along the immediate coast in parts of Florida along with squally showers associated with Sandy. These winds are kicking up very high surf and are generating storm surges of about 1-3ft. Rainfall totals here should be around 2″. Tropical storm conditions should subside from south to north along the East Coast of Florida today and tomorrow as Sandy moves northwards and north-northeastwards. Bermuda… Tropical Storm conditions are possible on Sunday here as the wind field of this cyclone expands. A tropical storm watch is in effect as a result. Squally showers with (near) tropical storm conditions and large southwesterly swells are to be expected to start the work week here. The fact that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda and along the US East coast simultaneously suggests a storm more than 600miles in diameter. US East Coast… *Saturday morning – Monday morning: South Carolina and North Carolina (to Wilmington) will see offshore winds as Sandy passes well to the east this weekend. Tropical Storm conditions are possible mainly in the offshore marine areas here, but unlikely on land. Some showers may develop to produce some gusty winds however. Tropical storm watches are in effect along the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. There may be an area of onshore winds in the Outer Banks for a time that could produce some coastal flooding, and sound-side flooding will remain a threat for much of the storm’s passage. *Monday morning – Wednesday night: Outer Banks, NC northwards to Maine: Sandy is expected to make landfall in Southern New Jersey, near the mouth of Delaware Bay according to the National Hurricane Center’s most recent forecast. The entire New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts coasts could see: tropical storm conditions with hurricane force gusts possible, heavy rain that may lead to some inland flooding, and severe coastal flooding from a large storm tide. Meanwhile, areas inland and to the south may still see tropical storm force winds (or at least gusts to that strength), heavy potentially flooding rains, and even some snow farther inland; this could extend as far inland as Ontario and Quebec. Off shore winds, to the south of Sandy, may allow for hazardously low water levels, or coastal flooding from an unusual direction in Chesapeake Bay and the Outer Banks. Specifics of this forecast will be refined as the storm gets closer. Pay attention to emergency management messages and products/warnings from local and regional officials. Hurricane Sandy at landfall in Cuba around 1:30am Eastern Time October 25th. GOES imagery. Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba around 1:30am this morning. According to the National Hurricane Center, Sandy had 110mph winds and a minimum central pressure near 957mb at landfall. The storm came ashore just to the west of the city of Santiago de Cuba where sustained winds of 78mph gusting to 114mph with a pressure of 960mb was reported before the station stopped reporting so conditions were likely worse than this at the height of the storm. A storm surge between 4 and 7 feet likely occurred near this city. Yesterday evening, Sandy exited the coast of Jamaica and underwent rapid intensification where the central pressure fell from 970mb to 954mb in six hours before its Cuba landfall. Sandy has since emerged from Cuba and has weakened slightly to a 100mph, 967mb storm. Some re-strengthening is already occurring as the storm heads northwards in an area that appears to be favorable for tropical cyclone development. The Bahamas are going to get the worst of Sandy today as this dangerous storm moves through the islands into the West Atlantic. As of 11am, Sandy had 105mph sustained winds and a minimum central pressure of 964mb. Forecast track… Sandy is expected to move northwards through the central Bahamas today and northwestwards into Northwestern Bahamas this evening, nearing the Florida coast in response to an approaching trough over the central US. From there, Sandy should be turned back towards the north-northeast as the trough starts to move off the East coast of the US, without a Florida landfall, and start to move into the Western Atlantic near the US East coast. On Sunday, Sandy is expected to turn back to the north and approach New England as it gets absorbed into/absorbs the trough over the Northeastern States. What to expect… Caribbean: Tropical storm conditions are starting to subside in Cuba and Haiti so warnings have been discontinued there, but heavy rain lingers in Haiti and the Dominican Republic where total rainfall accumulations are expected to be 12-18inches with isolated areas of 20inches in the mountains – life threatening flash flooding and mudslides may result, especially on Hispaniola. Bahamas: Hurricane conditions will be occurring in some of the islands of the central and northwestern Bahamas today and into tomorrow morning as Sandy moves through the island chain, Hurricane Warnings are in effect there. Storm surges up to 8 feet are possible in the Bahamas where onshore eyewall winds occur. Heavy rain of 3-6 inches is expected to cause some localized flooding in combination with storm surges. Florida: Late tonight and on Friday, tropical storm conditions may occur on the east coast of Florida where Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings are in effect from the Florida Keys to north of Melbourne. Up to three inches of rain are possible in Florida from the squally outer bands of Sandy. Some modest sea level rises and extremely rough surf will cause extensive beach erosion and very dangerous rip currents as the storm passes. Bermuda: Sandy may be large enough and head far enough eastwards to bring strong or even tropical storm force winds to Bermuda this weekend and into early next week along with some squally showers and very rough surf. New England: Early next week, after the Sandy moves away from the Bahamas, Florida, and Bermuda, it is expected to take aim on New England as it merges into a stalled trough that is expected to set up there. This is after day five in the forecast, so there is a very high degree of uncertainty in this track, but even more so because this situation is so delicate that any slight change in the trajectory after day five will send the storm into a different area of the coast. Regardless, expect a very severe Ocean Storm that may be comparable to the Perfect Storm in 1991, except expect Sandy to move inland and bring coastal flooding, tropical storm or hurricane force winds, heavy flooding rain, and as cold air from Canada associated with the trough moves in, some snow in the interior Northeast, especially in the Mountains. Hurricane Sandy on the southern coast of Jamaica. An eye is apparent on this RGB visible satellite image from NOAA’s GOES imager. Hurricane conditions could commence soon in Jamaica. Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Sandy this morning found that the storm has quickly strengthened into a category one hurricane with 80mph winds and 973mb central pressure. Some slight strengthening is possible just before a landfall occurs in Jamaica today where Hurricane Warnings are in effect. Heavy rains along with near tropical storm conditions are already occurring in coastal Jamaica; a gust to 51mph was recently observed in Kingston, Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center’s map of Tropical Storm and Hurricane advisories as of 11am Eastern. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for: * Haiti * The Central and Northwestern Bahamas A Hurricane Watch is in effect for: * The Central and Northwestern Bahamas A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for: * The Southeastern Bahamas * Florida East coast from the Volusia/Brevard county line to Ocean Reef, FL * Upper Florida Keys from Ocean Reef south to Craig Key, FL and Florida Bay Heavy rain of between 6 and 12 inches could trigger flash flooding and mudslides which will likely be the biggest threat to life in the Caribbean as Sandy exits to the north. Outer spiral bands extend far to the east of the storm and will likely produce heavy rains into Haiti and the Dominican Republic along with a chance for tornadoes and squally weather. Sandy is expected to continue northwards and make a second landfall in Eastern Cuba as a slightly weaker hurricane. But thereafter, Sandy is expected to begin to interact with a trough over the US East Coast and the forecast becomes increasingly uncertain. We are still unsure of how Sandy will interact with the trough, but it is looking increasingly like Sandy will become a powerful post-tropical storm that moves ashore somewhere from the Mid-Atlantic to Atlantic Canada that will cause severe impacts along the coast. This solution may involve the mixture of a tropical air mass and a polar air mass that could result in a heavy snow event for the interior Northeast. Depending on how far east Sandy goes, and how big the storm gets, Bermuda may see some strong winds- this solution is looking less likely today. Remember, the forecast after three days is still very uncertain but impacts to the US are becoming more likely according to the pattern that is unfolding. To make these forecasts more accurate, more weather balloons are being launched in the US, and hurricane hunters will continue to investigate the storm.
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Monday, October 29, 2012 Comparison of Irene and Sandy Update 10:20am CDT: Pressure has dropped again to 937.5 mb. Sandy breaks another record for pressure every time it drops. This is lower than forecast for 2pm EDT, so the storm may be strengthening even more than expected. Parts of Atlantic City are already flooded. And, the water is only going to rise to "major" flood levels. ORIGINAL POSTING: In this case, bigger = worse. Irene on top, Sandy on bottom. The Hurricane Hunters have now measured a pressure of 939 millibars, which is lower than forecast and the storm is still strengthening. It may reach Cat 2 hurricane strength before landfall. There is a report of sustained winds of 90 mph just off the coast of Long Island with gusts well above 100 mph. I believe (as previously stated, scroll down to Saturday's postings) the NWS's decision not to issue hurricane warnings for Hurricane Sandy was a very poor decision. Update 10:20am: Hurricane warnings in effect off the coast but only "hurricane force" -- whatever that means -- on the coast an inland.

UPDATED November 6, 2012 Hurricane Sandy: Covering the Storm A 13-day chronicle of the devastating East Coast storm and its aftermath that killed more than 100 people, destroyed whole communities in coastal New York and New Jersey, left tens of thousands homeless, crippled mass transit, triggered paralyzing gas shortages, inflicted billions of dollars in infrastructure damage and cut power to more than 8 million homes, some of which remained dark for weeks.

Tech How Will Hurricane Sandy Affect The Internet? [VIDEO] Hurricane Sandy is threatening the Eastern Seaboard, and meteorologists are predicting no mercy from the Category 1 storm's rain and winds. Apart from the water and wind damage, hurricanes have a history of knocking out the tech that keeps us going. Datacenters are most critical. Housing hundreds of computers that power sites like Netflix and Dropbox, Amazon, Apple and Google all rely on these server farms. And we all rely on the cloud services they provide — Amazon’s cloud is powering at least one percent of the entire Internet. The servers, housed largely in Virginia and other high-intensity storm zones, have had a history of being taken down, but companies are feverishly working to fortify their centers before Sandy strikes. So if all goes well, those pinned down by the storm can keep busy on Pinterest and Reddit until Sandy blows away. Check out the video above to see footage of the storm thus far and our studied analysis of what to expect. What do you plan to do if the Internet goes down? Tell us in the comments below. 2. Laptop This may seem like an eleventh hour step, but some people choose to power their mobile devices by sucking the remaining charge from their laptops. That way, their charge is more portable and versatile. 3. Hand Crank Not just for emergency radios, a hand crank can also power your devices. This option from K-Tor, called the Pocket Socket, generates up to 10 watts of electricity at 120 volts. It can charge iOS and Android devices, e-readers, digital cameras and GPS devices. 4. Solar Harness the power of the sun by connecting your fading batteries to a solar charger like the Solio Bolt. The Bolt can charge USB-powered devices, like iPhones and most e-readers. Its built-in battery can provide full charges to two smartphones. Otherwise, use its solar panels or USB port to activate the solar charger. 5. Public Outlets Although your house may be dark, storefronts and other public areas sometimes run on different grids that enjoy power. During blackouts, many businesses are forgiving of residents who need to power up. Ask if you can plug-in at a local cafe, library or retail shop.

Read More Hurricane Sandy Roars Ashore, Threatening Record Surge By Andrew Freedman Published: October 29th, 2012 After days of intense preparations, East Coast residents were beginning to feel the full effects of Hurricane Sandy on Monday as it brought tropical storm force winds to New York City, along with a damaging storm surge. Officials and homeowners from Delaware to Massachusetts were anxiously awaiting Monday evening’s high tide, which will occur just as the fiercest winds and waves pound the coastline, possibly causing a record storm surge in New York City, Atlantic City, and other vulnerable coastal locations. The storm will be felt as far inland as West Virginia and Tennessee, where blizzard warnings are in effect for higher elevations, as cold air wraps around the storm and dumps up to 3 feet of snow in some spots. By midweek, the storm could create record waves on the Great Lakes, as the storm spins its way west, and then northward into Canada. Sandy has made an earlier turn toward the northwest than expected, which puts the central New Jersey coastline in the crosshairs for a potentially record high storm surge on Monday night. Already, the Monday morning high tide resulted in moderate-to-major coastal flooding in New Jersey and low-lying areas in New York City. Winds were gusting to 50 mph in New York before noon, and were expected to increase to 70- to 80-mph gusts by Monday night. Strong winds are forecast to spread inland and cover a massive area from Virginia to Massachusetts, eventually moving west to the Great Lakes. Even parts of Ontario, Canada will be impacted by this unusual storm. The National Weather Service is warning of a “life threatening” storm surge threat all the way into southern New England, with 6- to 11-foot storm surge possible at The Battery in Manhattan, and in coastal Connecticut along Long Island Sound. Computer models agreed that The Battery in Lower Manhattan, Sandy Hook, N.J., and Atlantic City will see the highest storm tides on record. That data goes back to 1893, 1932, and 1911, respectively. At The Battery, the prior record occurred during Hurricane Donna in 1960. As of noon ET, the central estimate for The Battery was slightly more than 6 feet above the Mean High Water level (mean high tide), which would top the storm tide (tide level along with the storm surge) from Hurricane Irene by more than a foot. For Sandy Hook, Hurricane Sandy could top Irene's storm tide by 1-to-2 feet. In Bridgeport, Conn., the central estimate for surge was about 7.5 feet, which corresponds to a storm tide more than 5 feet above mean high tide. In Philadelphia, the surge may peak at one foot, but the tide could reach more than 2 feet above average. In Atlantic City, the central estimate for surge is about 5.5 feet, reaching about 5 feet above mean high tide. To figure out the particular risks for your local area, visit Climate Central’s interactive map A record storm surge in New York City could flood the city’s subway system, which is the lifeblood of transportation in the region, since tunnel entrances are extraordinarily vulnerable to coastal flooding. In anticipation of the flood threat, city officials shut down the entire transit system as of 7 p.m. on Sunday, which was only the second shutdown in history. The first shutdown occurred just 14 months ago, when Hurricane Irene lashed the city with a 4.13 foot storm surge. That resulted in a total water level (how high the water got when looking at both the tide and storm surge) peaking at 4.8 feet above average high tide. As of Monday morning, a National Weather Service computer model and a model run by the Stevens Institute of Technology was projecting a peak storm tide — the water level reached when combining storm surge plus the tide — of at least 6 feet above average high tide close to the Monday evening high tide, which occurs at 8:13 pm at The Battery. Satellite image of Hurricane Sandy as it rounded Cape Hatteras, N.C. on October 28.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NASA. According to Climate Central’s Surging Seas mapping tool, there are approximately 308,000 New York City residents who live below 6 feet above the mean high water level, and storm surge models show the water rising to at least such a level during Monday night's high tide. The storm is such a formidable coastal flood threat because of its massive wind field, with tropical storm force winds extending more than 500 miles from its center, setting a record for the largest hurricane observed in the North Atlantic. The wind field means that even though the storm will be coming ashore in New Jersey, damaging winds and power outages will be possible across the entire eastern third of the country, down to the Georgia/Florida border. Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia are both in line to see wind gusts to at least 70 mph by Monday night, along with heavy rainfall, prompting the federal government to shut down for the day. In the higher elevations of seven states from Maryland to Tennessee — including two key politically important swing states in next week’s presidential election, Ohio and Virginia — snow is the greatest threat from Hurricane Sandy. Accumulations of up to 3 feet or more are forecast in some spots, which could cause power outages and structural problems due to the heavy weight of the snow. The storm is not only unusually large, it is also extremely powerful, thanks to abundant energy from the ocean, as water temperatures off the East Coast are running several degrees above average for this time of year, and energy from jet stream winds moving in from the southwest. The storm is already more powerful than the “Perfect Storm” in 1991, and has tied the record for the lowest air pressure reading ever recorded north of Cape Hatteras, N.C., which was set on Long Island during a 1938 hurricane. Timing will be key to determining the storm surge and extent of the associated damage, since if the peak onshore winds occur around the time of high tide, that will maximize the surge. As of Monday morning, most computer models indicated that this worst-case scenario is likely — although not certain — to occur. “A long duration coastal flood event is expected and moderate to major flooding this morning into early afternoon . . . and potential historic flooding tonight into early Tuesday morning,” the National Weather Service said in a statement. “The potential is high for significant inundation and damage to structures in historically flood prone spots.” Destructive waves of up to 12 feet in New York Harbor, and significantly larger in locations more exposed to the open ocean, could cause “significant damage to coastal structures.” In addition to coastal flooding, high surf, with waves offshore measuring at least 30 feet in height, will help cause significant beach erosion. During Monday morning’s high tide, significant coastal flooding was reported in some areas of Brooklyn, Atlantic City, parts of Connecticut, and Long Island. The Weather Service has issued increasingly dire warnings for the coastal flooding risk, at one point on Sunday the office in Philadelphia put out this message to people who might have been reluctant to heed evacuation orders: “IF YOU ARE RELUCTANT, THINK ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES, THINK ABOUT THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHO WILL BE UNABLE TO REACH YOU WHEN YOU MAKE THE PANICKED PHONE CALL TO BE RESCUED, THINK ABOUT THE RESCUE/RECOVERY TEAMS WHO WILL RESCUE YOU IF YOU ARE INJURED OR RECOVER YOUR REMAINS IF YOU DO NOT SURVIVE,” the statement said. Climate Change Connection? The storm track is being influenced by an unusually strong "blocking" pattern in the upper atmosphere, with a massive dome of high pressure located southwest of Greenland. Without this blocking, the storm would have been able to turn out to sea, without harming the U.S. It's an example of what can happen when blocking patterns appear at precisely the wrong time. Additionally, there are many other ingredients that are converging to create this perfect storm, including a deep dip in the jet stream across the eastern U.S. that is playing a role in essentially capturing the storm and flinging it inland. "History is being written as an extreme weather event continues to unfold, one which will occupy a place in the annals of weather history as one of the most extraordinary to have affected the United States," wrote Weather Channel senior meteorologist Stu Ostro. "A meteorologically mind-boggling combination of ingredients is coming together: one of the largest expanses of tropical storm (gale) force winds on record with a tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic or for that matter anywhere else in the world; a track of the center making a sharp left turn in direction of movement toward New Jersey in a way that is unprecedented in the historical database; a 'warm-core' tropical cyclone embedded within a larger, nor'easter-like circulation; and eventually tropical moisture and arctic air combining to produce heavy snow in interior high elevations," Ostro said. Recent studies, including Ostro's own work, have shown that blocking patterns such as the one that is currently over the Atlantic have appeared with greater frequency and intensity in recent years. Some scientists think that may be related to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which is one of the most visible consequences of manmade global warming. The 2012 sea ice melt season, which ended just one month ago, was extreme, with sea ice extent, volume, and other measures all hitting record lows. The loss of sea ice opens large expanses of open water, which then absorbs more of the incoming solar radiation and adds heat and moisture to the atmosphere, thereby helping to alter weather patterns. Exactly how weather patterns are changing as a result, however, is a subject of active research. Global warming is also expected to alter hurricane frequency and strength, making North Atlantic hurricanes slightly more powerful, while reducing the overall number of storms during the coming decades. Detecting such changes in the observational record is difficult, considering the varying ways people have kept tabs on hurricanes prior to the era of hurricane hunter aircraft flights. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesfound that warmer sea surface temperatures are tied to an increase in stronger Atlantic hurricanes. Regardless of any changes in hurricane intensity, storms are already likely to produce more signiifcant coastal flooding, since sea levels have been rising during the past century, due to a combination of warming ocean waters and melting of polar ice caps. If Hurricane Sandy were to strike New York City in 2050, it would cause even more damage, since sea levels are expected to be considerably higher by midcentury. A recent study found that sea level rise has taken place at an accelerated rate at locations north of Norfolk, Va., and if this pace continues the Northeast could see much higher sea levels than other parts of the East Coast by midcentury.
disaster Hurricane Sandy Overview Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. Sandy was the deadliest hurricane to hit the Northeast in 40 years, and damage estimates have placed the cost at upwards of $68 billion. Only Hurricane Katrina cost more. Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic from Haiti and Jamaica and north into Canada. More than 200 deaths were attributed to the storm, with 146 of those in the United States and 98 in the Caribbean. NGOs remain on the ground helping people to rebuild their lives and local and federal jurisdictions are working to rebuild — and affect policy changes — to prevent such devastation from bring repeated. About $60.4 billion in federal aid has been provided to storm-affected areas. Background The 10th named storm of the 2012 hurricane season, Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic, with deaths extending from Haiti and Jamaica to Canada. While still out in the ocean, it affected North Carolina coastal areas, causing storm surges and flooding on barrier islands. As the storm came ashore in New Jersey, it was so massive that the effects were felt as far south as the mountains of Tennessee and West Virginia, and as far west as Lake Michigan. More than 200 deaths have since been attributed to the storm, with most of those in the United States. Sandy raised key questions about building in coastal areas, along with concerns and discussion about future storms. New York officials revived talk of a storm surge barrier to protect the city. The storm also recharged the issue of those who refuse mandatory evacuation orders, choosing to shelter in place instead. Hurricane Irene, which struck essentially the same area in 2011 without causing as much damage as feared, only complicated the issue of evacuation “need.” In Haiti, where residents continue to struggle to rebuild from the 2010 earthquake, the floods that followed the hurricane severely affected food security. The United Nations anticipates more than 1.5 million people at risk of food insecurity in 2013 due to the damage caused by Sandy. Cholera, which had broken out post-earthquake, was a continuing concern. In Cuba, news of the devastation was slow to arrive, though 20 percent of the population was affected. It took a full two weeks for the first aid to arrive, a 40-ton shipment from the United Nations. Another 40 tons quickly followed. U.S. Impact The hurricane made landfall in New York and New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, colliding with winter weather systems already present and creating a “perfect storm.” Widespread impact included destructive winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge flooding, and even heavy, wet snow. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide. At the height of the storm, more than 7.5 million people were without power. Power outages continued for weeks after the hurricane made landfall, yet many residents remained in their homes. In New England, Hurricane Sandy was complicated when a Nor’Easter blew in a few days later, bringing another blast of cold air and high storm surges to the area. West Virginia and Tennessee received nearly three feet of snow as a result of the storm. CDP Insights Insights from Dr. Irwin Redlener on Lessons from Hurricane Sandy: Dr. Irwin Redlener, Director, National Center for Disaster Preparedness, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University and Co-Chair, NYS Ready Commission and Center for Disaster Philanthropy Advisory Council Member outlines lessons in five key areas: evacuations, citizen preparedness, vulnerable populations, incident command and coordination, mental health, training, and recovery. Read his full analysis provided to Philanthropy New York. Insights from the CDP Advisory Council on Hurricane Sandy: While thousands of NGOs and volunteers rushed to offer much-needed immediate relief to communities and people impacted by Hurricane Sandy, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy estimated it would take years to fully rebuild communities in the United States and even longer in the Caribbean. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Advisory Council — experts from academia, the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors — offer their insights on long-term recovery needs and opportunities for donors. Donors While immediate relief dollars went to housing, food and clothing, the CDP Hurricane Sandy Disaster Fund was established to invest in long-term projects that fill gaps where public resources are unavailable or scarce. We requested grant applications from NGOs committed to projects that cross broad disciplines to ease the transition from disaster to normalcy; foster collaboration among donors; use existing local philanthropic networks and a work to strengthen local philanthropy; promote cross-sector coordination with academics, donors, think tanks, and public and private humanitarian actors; and support innovative research that informs policy and strengthens future disaster preparation and response. NGO Response AidMatrix worked to get the needs of impacted communities captured and listed on The National Donations Management Network. All Hands had two superstorm Sandy response efforts: Project Staten Island and Project Long Island. They housed staff and team leaders within the impacted areas, and coordinated efforts of volunteers to aid residents by removing debris (mucking) and removing affected walls/floors (gutting. American Red Cross worked both immediately and long-term to help those affected by the storm. Red Cross workers met with families to get them financial assistance to help with security and utility deposits, home repairs and rent, as well as link them to available social service programs. In addition, the Red Cross gave grants to a number of nonprofits working in New Jersey and New York to help people with home repairs, mold remediation, food and financial assistance, and to support the work of community. AmeriCares provided more than $6.5 million in aid, benefiting more than 450,000 people, including $3.5 million in medicines and relief supplies to hard-hit communities. AmeriCares also provided $3.0 million in funding to organizations ASPCA staff and responders provided immediate relief to families affected by flooding and power outages. Responders delivered supplies, crates and food to evacuation centers, where hundreds of animals were housed, in the five boroughs. After the storm, the ASPCA worked to ensure that animal shelters in some of the hardest-hit areas had the resources necessary to stay in operation. Through an emergency grant program, the ASPCA provided over 40 grants totaling over $350,000 to organizations responding to, or impacted by, Hurricane Sandy. The Coalition for the Homeless worked to repair damage to shelters in the New York area. Before the hurricane, 47,000 people were staying in homeless shelters, a 20 percent increase from 2011. Many of the homeless shelters were evacuated and some that offered specialty services, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and youths, were left without heat, while at least one encountered significant flooding. CERF (Craft Emergency Relief Fund + Artists’ Emergency Resources) offered emergency relief to craft artists and emergency resources that benefited all artists. In response to the storm, the organization launched the CERF+ Artists’ Relief Exchange in which artists can post needs and those with things or services to offer to artists can make them available. In addition, it offered grants up to $3,000 and no interest loans for craft artists who have had career-threatening emergencies. Church World Service shipped $480,000 worth of blankets, hygiene kits, baby care, emergency cleanup kits, and school kits to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It also launched a $100,000 appeal to provide relief in Haiti and Cuba. Catholic Charities USA worked with its local agencies to assess needs that Hurricane Sandy created in communities and provided immediate services. It estimated that 50 of its local agencies provided direct relief. In the months following Hurricane Sandy, Catholic Charities USA distributed approximately $2.75 million worth of grants and in-kind donations to Catholic Charities agencies affected by Hurricane Sandy. CCUSA has also pledged to provide additional services in the form of long-term recovery grants totaling roughly $5 million for disbursement over the next five years. Collegiate Church Corporation designated $200,000 to Hurricane Sandy relief. The organization’s five ministries are engaged in hands-on recovery work in Staten Island, the Rockaways, the New Jersey shore and the East Village. They distributed food and supplies and helped with clean up and rebuilding efforts. Episcopal Relief and Development remained in contact with key diocesan staff to gather information about where damage had occurred and what the most pressing needs were. Many Episcopal congregations launched into action, expanding their feeding ministries, providing basic supplies and gas cards, and hosting community agencies that connected people to services and federal disaster funds. Feeding America member food banks provided food and other supplies to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. More than 243 truckloads of food and grocery products–or 7.6 million pounds — were distributed to 11 food banks and more than $1 million was secured from corporate partners. Hands on Network, an enterprise of Points of Light, registered volunteers to respond to the disaster. Humane Society of the United States deployed more than 140 staff and volunteers, helped rescue more than 350 animals from devastated areas, cared for more than 700 animals in emergency shelters, and helped set up four distribution centers for supplies. With the HSUS’ help, owners reclaimed more than 400 pets in total. Jewish Federations of North America launched the JFNA Hurricane Relief Fund to contribute to recovery and rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The Jewish Federation system across the continent raised $7.4 million to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. The funds already have gone toward basic amenities like food, clothing and housing, and will continue to be allocated for long-term needs. International Medical Corps mobilized emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas of Haiti. In addition to medical care and screenings, IMC also distributed hygiene, shelter and kitchen kits to internally displaced families. Medical Reserve Corps instituted numerous preparedness and response activities related to Hurricane Sandy. The units that performed sheltering functions reported staffing and/or assisting in the setup of general community, functional, or special needs shelters and working at shelters in support of the American Red Cross. Units also indicated that they provided the community with health education, emergency communications support, and surge staffing to local hospitals, emergency management agencies, and public health departments. Islamic Relief USA worked with Smile, a local organization in New Jersey, to distribute food parcels to families in need in New Jersey. IRUSA staff and volunteers also provided shelter management services and helped however else needed at two separate hurricane shelters on the campus of Rutgers University until the shelters closed on Nov. 2. IRUSA also worked with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help with cleanup efforts across New Jersey and New York. National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD) collaborated with state VOAD members and helped to coordinate on a regional, multi-state level. The organization also posted two resource papers on its website, on providing food to infants and children in a disaster, and promoting the Disaster Distress Hotline. New York Cares, an organization that mobilizes volunteers in the city year-round, kicked off its annual coat drive earlier than usual to meet needs caused by Sandy. The organization gathered coats at the Veteran’s Day Parade. Presbyterian Church in America – Mission to North America worked closely with local church leadership to assess needs. The organization also worked through VOAD affiliations to determine specific needs. It also mobilized volunteers to assist in Atlantic City. Quality Parks documented the impact of the hurricane on the beaches in the region and sought donations to begin a Long Island Master Naturalist program, which will train volunteers in four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Salvation Army served first responders and survivors at 16 shelters throughout New Jersey, and provided meals in 12 counties. In New York City, it is coordinated the city’s Food Access Plan, overseeing distribution of food and water to 17 sites in Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. In Nassau County, N.Y., meals ready to eat provided by the state and 1,000 blankets provided by The Salvation Army were distributed to residents of Island Park, one of the hardest hit areas. And in nearby Suffolk County, the Salvation Army worked to distribute in-kind donations for Sandy survivors. Samaritan’s Purse coordinated more than 8,600 volunteers who cleared debris, removed downed trees, and made emergency repairs for more than 1,300 homeowners. The organization also helped 40 people return home over the course of the next two years by making repairs and building new homes are at no cost to homeowners who were chosen because they lacked the means to restore their own homes or because they lost their houses completely in the hurricane. Save the Children delivered food, hygiene supplies, blankets, toys and children’s clothing to children and families in shelters. This included supplemental food for 15,545 children and their families and 150,000 diapers and other infant hygiene supplies for families with young children. They opened storm-tested Child-Friendly Spaces at 16 shelters for children who did not have safe places to play. These spaces benefited 1,485 children. Save also helped nearly 30 local centers to re-open, through grants or distributions of materials. Save the Children raised more than $3 million for the Hurricane Children in Emergency Fund. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief (SBDR) volunteers prepared more than 1 million hot meals within two weeks of landfall of Hurricane Sandy. More than 1,000 SBDR volunteers assisted victims of Hurricane Sandy. Sparkrelief.org helped feed more than 4,000 people, and partnered with Aubuchon Hardware to collect and distribute goods donated by thousands of people, and helped Lush Cosmetics distribute over $40,000 worth of bath products to those in need along the coast in New York and New Jersey. World Renew rapid response teams served in the New Jersey communities of Midland Park, Little Ferry, and Union Beach to remove downed trees, clean-out flooded homes, and prevent mold. Regional and project managers and staff assisted many communities in the early planning stages for a long-term recovery. World Renew provided start-up grants to committees in Bergen, Monmouth, and Middlesex Counties in New Jersey. World Vision disbursed over $2.4 million in assistance while working with strategic partners in providing disaster relief supplies, essential items and other non-food items that facilitated long-term recover in neighborhoods throughout New York City. Take Action Ensure the needs of vulnerable populations are being met by disaster response and recovery initiatives. These include the elderly with no young relatives, the physically and mentally disabled (including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder), etc. Invest in organizations that have a history of working in these areas and previous relationships with those involved. Additionally, assess ways to assist vulnerable populations in preparedness. Many residents in New York chose to shelter in place, which was made more difficult as power outages continued to for weeks. While some of those residents were resilient for a few days, as the disaster lingered on, living conditions became extremely challenging. Create preparedness programs that include potential outcomes, as well as weather forecast models that include consequence analysis. Improved risk analysis may help future populations be more willing to move out of harm’s way. Support further research into climate change and its effect on natural disaster occurrence. In addition, consider how this research could be linked to disaster risk reduction strategies. Develop guidelines for protecting children—both physically and psychologically—during and after disasters. Strategies for tracking displaced children, for example, could be improved, and standard protocols could be set for schools and day care centers. Explore more stable and resilient supply chains for medical needs, including prescriptions. Infrastructure damage—especially in areas of large populations—can mean many without access to the help they need. Seek out programs that aim to help with recovery and rebuilding in overlooked areas such as West Virginia, Connecticut, Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. With large population centers like New York and New Jersey affected, some of the less densely populated areas have not received as much media attention or philanthropic support. Learn More Facts & Stats Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. 286 people died, 146 of them in the U.S., making Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as the deadliest hurricane to hit the East cost since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. There were $68 billion in damages, much of it concentrated in New York and New Jersey, placing it among the worst U.S. disasters. Sandy damaged or destroyed 305,000 housing units and disrupted more than 265,000 businesses in New York. In New Jersey, 346,000 housing units were destroyed or damaged, and 190,000 businesses affected. Congress passed a $50.5 billion emergency package of relief and recovery aid. Added to the $9.7 billion previously approved for a federal flood insurance program, the total is roughly in line with the $60.4 billion President Barack Obama requested. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide.
Superstorm Sandy — Photo by Chris Lieberman Situation Overview Superstorm Sandy struck the United States on October 29, 2012, affecting 24 states and causing more than 100 deaths and an estimated $64 billion in damage. New Jersey and New York were particularly hard hit. Our Response Response to the superstorm will be long-term. During the first year of response, Gift of the Heart Kits and CWS blankets valued at more than $1 million were provided for survivors; and more than 1,000 people participated in nine “Recovery Tools and Training” workshops in New Jersey, New York, West Virginia and Connecticut. As of May 2014, 233 work teams consisting of 3,892 volunteers have served in response to Superstorm Sandy, helping families with clean-up and rebuilding efforts. 17 PDA-related hosting sites are currently serving communities in New York and New Jersey. Stories of hope The New Jersey Shore Following Rosedale Presbyterian Church’s volunteer mission in New Jersey, Jim Davis shared a reflection from his first mission trip. Working from sun up to sun down all week, the team also shared in a ministry of presence. “Talking with residents on the street, it was easy to recognize the freshness of the storm in their minds, as they were easily persuaded to share their own stories of the storm and the resulting floods.” Read The New Jersey Shore 2014.
Sand bags are delivered to NYU Hospital in Manhattan. Hurricane Sandy churned towards New York City Monday as the first rain hit Battery Park shortly before 7am and winds started to pick up. The streets of lower Manhattan were earily quiet just after 8am with the normally bustling streets empty. New Yorkers hunkered down in their homes, transforming the metropolis into a transit-free ghost town. With fears of an 11-foot water surge that could inundate low-lying neighborhoods, city and state officials ordered residents to evacuate for higher ground and shut down all public transportation. High-wind warnings went into effect at 6 a.m. Monday and continue through 6 p.m. Tuesday. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood warning from 6 a.m. on Monday to 3 p.m. on Tuesday. Mike Stobe/Getty Images Long Beach police patrol the boardwalk as Hurricane Sandy approaches on October 28, 2012 in Long Beach, New York. Schools and courts were shuttered. Broadway cancelled Sunday night and Monday performances. And the New York Stock Exchange closed for trading Monday and warned it might shut Tuesday as well. Mass transit service also came to a grinding halt and was not expected to resume before Tuesday. For the second time in as many years, Mayor Bloomberg ordered all residents of flood-prone areas — known as Zone A — to evacuate their homes. The mayor did the same thing before Hurricane Irene last year, but that storm fizzled as it hit the Big Apple. Eva Hambach/Getty Images Jefferson Siegel for New York Daily News Con Ed emergency vehicles mobilize in the north end of Union Square in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy on Sunday. Nevertheless, Bloomberg urged New Yorkers to take this year’s warnings seriously. “When there’s no mass transit, and with weather as bad as it’s going to be, we don’t want to put children’s lives at risk,” Hizzoner said from the Office of Emergency Management in downtown Brooklyn. “We need cooperation of the public. Please listen to the evacuation order.” Pearl Gabel for New York Daily News Caution tape and emptiness by the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan in preparation for Hurricane Sandy. (Pearl Gabel for New York Daily News) Allison Joyce/Getty Images A man surfs at Rockaway Beach as Hurricane Sandy approaches on Sunday. In Washington, Federal Emergency Management Administrator Craig Fugate took an urgent tone. “the time for preparing and talking is over,” he said. “People need to be acting now.” President Obama, who declared a state of emergency in New York and New Jersey, promised the government would “respond big and respond fast” after the storm hits. Norman Y. Lono for New York Daily News Signs at the George Washington Bridge bus station at Broadway and 178th St. inform riders that buses to Atlantic City have been cancelled. Pearl Gabel for New York Daily News MTA buses labeled Hurricane Shelter drive through Battery Park City to pick up residents in Zone A being evacuated before Hurricane Sandy. “My message to the governors as well as to the mayors is anything they need, we will be there, and we will cut through red tape,” he said. “We are not going to get bogged down with a lot of rules.” Obama also urged Americans to watch out for one another. “In times like this, one of the things that Americans do is we pull together and we help out one another,” he said. “Check on your neighbor, check on your friend. Make sure that they are prepared. If we do, then we’re going to get through this storm just fine.” Jefferson Siegel for New York Daily News The line stretched down the block all the way to 3rd Ave. at the Trader Joe's supermarket on East 14th St. as people stocked up in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy on Sunday. As of 11 p.m. Sunday, the deluge had not begun. Winds were picking up and evacuations were under way in low-lying parts of Hoboken and Jersey City — and further south in some central Jersey towns. But the worst of Sandy’s onslaught wasn’t expected to hit New York City until Monday afternoon at the earliest. More than 5,000 homes in New Jersey are already without power thanks to Hurricane Sandy. Long Island is experiencing mini-outages of a dozen homes or less. Even more outages are likely to hit New Jersey as downed trees take down power lines, WABC-TV reported. The service interruptions in Long Island started Sunday night in Lakeview and West Hempstead, according to the Malverne-West Hempstead-Lynnbrook Patch. The violent squall — dubbed “Frankenstorm” because it will combine with a storm system from the west and cold air from Canada — has already cost at least 65 lives in the Caribbean. Ken Blevins/Wilmington Star-News via AP Weather forecasters predict wind gusts topping 80 miles an hour and storm surges reaching 11 feet when the killer ’cane makes landfall along the central New Jersey coast Monday night or early Tuesday — timed to high tide, which occurs at 8:11 p.m. Monday in Sandy Hook, N.J.; 8:53 p.m. in New York Harbor, and 8:59 p.m. in Far Rockaway, Queens. “Unfortunately, this sort of storm is the worst-case scenario for our region,” said Sean Potter, a National Weather Service spokesman. Hurricane Irene battered the city for 12 hours last year, but Sandy is expected to pummel the area relentlessly for 24 to 36 hours, forecasters said. Debbie Egan-Chin/New York Daily News Diane Perrotta paints "Shove it Sandy" on a wooden boar den up window on her house in Breezy Point as people in the Rockaways prep for the coming of Hurricane Sandy. “This is nothing to play with,” said Gov. Cuomo. “This is nothing to take lightly. “You want to stay at home, be prepared, enjoy the family, read a book,” Cuomo added. No such luck for the 375,000 people living in Battery Park City; Brighton Beach, Brooklyn; Broad Channel, Queens, and other low-lying Zone A neighborhoods that Bloomberg ordered evacuated by Sunday afternoon. “I’m going home to my mother’s in Staten Island,” said Jeffrey Stainback as he loaded clothes and blankets into an SUV near his apartment. Stainback, 27, said he would also pack food for his family and a playpen for his three kids while they waited out the perfect storm. Stephen Barcelo For New York Daily News Fire Island residents are evacuated. “The essentials,” he said. The city also shut off hot water and electric power at the public housing developments in the evacuation zone to pry people out, but many opted to ride out the storm rather than shlep to the 76 shelters set-up for storm refugees and their pets. “I’m getting prepared, and we are going to stick it out,” said Marilyn Harris, 63, whose Richards St. apartment is four blocks from the Red Hook, Brooklyn, waterfront. Others said they would go after having gotten a scare during Hurricane Irene. “Last year, it was an eye-opener,” said Dorothy Thornton, 38, one of the few people to board buses from the Coney Island Houses on Sunday afternoon. “It’s better to be safe than sorry.” Some hotels cleared out in lower Manhattan, and most residents of Battery Park City’s high-rise condos — where power and water were cut Sunday evening — were also on the move. “We’re getting a hotel at the Gansevoort. We’re going to turn it into a hurricane party,” said Alex Todd, 33, who works in the gold industry. “The mayor is saying it’s mandatory. I probably would have stayed otherwise.” Elsewhere in the city, people piled up on supplies, leading to long lines in supermarkets and shortages of some key items. Plywood, batteries and tape were top sellers in a Lowe’s hardware store in Gowanus, Brooklyn. “We have generators, but there’s a waiting list now,” said a worker there. The storm cut short the reopening of the Statue of Liberty after a $30 million interior renovation project. Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar officially reopened the monument with a group of West Point cadets Sunday — then quickly closed it to the public as Sandy churned. Amtrak halted train service to parts of the East Coast, including trips between Washington and New York. Officials in Nassau and Suffolk counties urged residents of low-lying areas to evacuate, and a mandatory exodus from Fire Island was ordered. Dozens of people wheeled suitcases and pet carriers off the Ocean Beach ferry terminal in Bay Shore, L.I., just an hour before Fire Island’s 2 p.m. evacuation. Frazzled island residents said the storm surge has already brought the ocean to the dunes, and some roads are already a foot under water. “When you get off the boat, it’s 18 inches deep,” said Ilene Patrick, 56, who owns two homes and a business on Fire Island. She had winterized her homes and boarded up the house closest to the ocean. “We’re off. There’s nothing we can do now,” she said. Others in the metropolitan area were already preparing to come back to ruined homes. “We actually kind of said little goodbyes to the house,” said Carolina Della Valle, a mother of two in DUMBO, Brooklyn. “You just never really know.” Some workers were rushing to get to work Sunday evening, just before subways stopped running. Ernest Borno, 35, a porter, was holding a pillow as he waited in Kensington, Brooklyn, to take the F train to the midtown building where his shift begins Monday. “I’m just trying to get paid,” he said, noting he’ll be on call all night and will sleep on a cot at the building. Officials are activating 400 National Guard members on Long Island and 200 in the city. The state Health Department is ordering that all adult nursing homes be staffed at 150% of standard levels and that staff members be prepared to stay for 48 to 72 hours, the governor said. Utility companies across the state will be on standby to help with power outages. “In a situation like this, you prepare for the worst and hope for the best,” Cuomo said.

Update: Hurricane Sandy Hits U.S. East Coast, What You Need to Know GOWANUS, NEW YORK CITY--The winds continue to increase here, howling past windows and splattering the rain. Tiny beads of water almost feel like sand when you step outside thanks to the strong gusts. Such is Hurricane Sandy as it speeds into the New York metropolitan region and prepares to turn and slam in slow motion into the southern coast of New Jersey tonight. At the same time, the storm will be merging with other weather systems to form what's known as a "post-tropical cyclone," or Frankenstorm as some meteorologists have called it in honor of the approaching Halloween holiday. And this Frankenstorm will be capable of dropping as much as three feet of snow in the mountains of West Virginia while dumping rain as far east as Rhode Island. In fact, Hurricane Sandy stretches more than 1,000 miles, exposing a vast swath of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard and inland to hurricane force winds of as much as 90 miles-per-hour. Winds are being affected from Maine to Florida and inland as far west as the Mississippi River. And the storm won't stop for a few days. Already, sea levels are elevated from North Carolina up through Long Island, New York. These high water levels will rise an extra foot or two thanks to an assist from the full moon, a lunar high tide tonight that will repeat over the next few days as the tide cycles in and out every 12 hours or so. "It's going to take until Tuesday or Wednesday for the onshore flow [from Hurricane Sandy] to stop and the water to get back to normal levels," said National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb. In fact, locations like New York City's harbor, which are expected to bear the largest storm surge, may see water levels rise nearly 12 feet above normal—or roughly three times as high as the surge from last year's Hurricane Irene. It's unclear how far that water will penetrate into the five boroughs, but New York City has already ordered residents living along much of the 600 miles of coastline in the city and in low-lying areas, like the Gowanus neighborhood in Brooklyn, to evacuate. That's where I live and it's a canal flowing through filled-in swampland—and one of the nation's newest Superfund sites thanks to a legacy of industrial pollution and sewage overflows. And then there's rain, which is already falling steadily. In some places more than a foot of rain may fall, giving rise to the possibility of flash floods and, in coming days, river flooding like that seen in upstate New York and Vermont after Hurricane Irene. Here in Gowanus, the biggest threat may be storm surge paired with the kind of heavy rain that requires the sewer system to discharge directly into the harbor. If those discharge pipes are underwater, the sewer system may back up and overflow back into shower drains and toilets. One thing that will certainly be underwater here is the subway system, which requires electrical pumps to keep it dry even when it isn't raining. "The subway system and saltwater do not mix," noted New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo in his own press conference today. As a precaution, the subway system has been shut down, forcing would-be evacuees to rely on buses or whatever transport they can find. Evacuation is critical, said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, because firemen, police, Coast Guard and other first responders will be put in harm's way attempting to rescue those who decided to shelter in place and ignore the warnings. President Barack Obama urged those of us in affected areas to heed such warnings in his own comments on Hurricane Sandy. Yet, federal postal workers remained out on the streets delivering mail here today and New York City workers were not given the day off, as residents need them working overtime, according to Bloomberg.

But at least Monday, that was not a problem, and Channels 2, 4, 5, 7 and 11, as well as New York 1, blew out all their other programming for non-stop storm coverage. A reporter from NY1 reports live from the South Street Seaport. A reporter from NY1 reports live from the South Street Seaport. Cable news channels CNN, Fox News and MSNBC devoted most of their coverage to the storm, though not all of it. Fox News announced early in the day that it would drop all its regular shows except Monday evening's "Hannity" to focus on the storm. MSNBC said it would still air its regular prime-time shows, while CNN said its prime-time shows would focus on the storm. The morning shows "Fox & Friends" and "Morning Joe" on MSNBC tied the storm into political stories, asking about strategy and Sandy's potential effect on early voting. But the most detailed coverage came from The Weather Channel, which also had the most informative graphics, and most prominently featured and explained the satellite photo that showed the breadth of the storm. Taken from 22,000 miles above the earth, the picture was worth 22,000 words. Live storm coverage on Fox 5 Extended weather coverage can be problematic for TV stations, because once everyone knows the basic situation, viewers turn their attention to what happens next - and no one has that answer. Live storm coverage on Fox 5 Even the Weather Channel did a little overreaching, with a graphic designed to tell viewers the probability they will lose power. It showed much of the nearby tri-state area had a "20-50%" chance - which really doesn't say much, since power loss often depends more on local factors like the concentration of trees. Still, the sheer ominous potential of Sandy kept the surf, wind and flooding pictures interesting. It also helps that all stations now can instantly relay videos and photos tweeted or emailed by viewers. On the meteorology side, Mike Bettes, Carl Parker and other experts at The Weather Channel — as well as many broadcast network meteorologists — had the time to explain what all the geek numbers about low pressure and storm surge levels actually mean. Anchor teams wisely gave reporters like Phil Lipof of Channel 7 the time to explain what was happening with the real-life ocean. In a long report from Seaside Heights late in the morning, he illustrated exactly how strong the winds were now blowing and how powerful the waves had become.

In the hardest-hit regions, however, from southern New Jersey up through New York City and east along Long Island and the Connecticut coast, the story was no longer the storm itself, but rather on the causes (especially Sandy’s possible relationship to climate change) and on the grim aftermath — millions without power, tens of thousands evacuated from their homes, as much as $20 billion by some estimates, and at least 50 deaths in the U.S. alone. The New York Times, as the region’s most important newspaper by far, also had the widest-ranging coverage. Perhaps the most poignant of the stories was titled “In Storm Deaths, Mystery, Fate and Bad Timing,” it looked not at cold statistics, but at the lives of individuals — men, women, children and even babies — that were ended, in the blink of an eye, by Sandy’s vicious power. “They stepped in the wrong puddle,” it begins, “…..They walked the dog at the wrong moment. Or they did exactly what all the emergency experts instructed them to do — they huddled inside and waited for its anger to go away. The storm found them all… They were infants and adolescents, people embarking on careers and those looking back on them — the ones who paid the ultimate price of this most destructive of storms.” The Times also has a “Tracking the Storm” blog with new entries appearing as often as once a minute, with entries as diverse as a warning from New York Mayor Bloomberg that “You’re not going to be able to get in” to Manhattan with fewer than three people per car, to a report on a helicopter tour of the devastated Jersey Shore by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and President Obama, in which the two shelved political differences to form a (temporary) mutual admiration society, to an essay by media reporter David Carr on “How Hurricane Sandy Slapped the Sarcasm Out of Twitter.” Much thinner on resources but focused entirely on the region’s hardest-hit state, the Newark Star-Ledger, New Jersey’s largest paper, plunged deeply into Sandy coverage as well, reporting on the nearly 2.4 million New Jerseyans still lacking power as of Wednesday morning and dozens of other local stories (the much smaller Asbury Park Press, however, got the scoop on statements from Snooki and other members of the “Jersey Shore” cast lamenting the destruction of what they called their second home).
A day after Superstorm Sandy crashed into the American east coast, the extent of the devastation became clear. Homes were found washed off their foundations; power outages disrupted lives in all corners of the state; and landmarks such as the Star Jet roller coaster in Seaside Heights were plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. But millions across the east coast will on Wednesday attempt to resume their day-to-day lives, as companies, markets and airports attempt to reopen, despite grim projections of power and mass transit outages around New York for several more days. Sandy, which killed 40 people in the US, pushed inland later on Tuesday and caused several feet of snow to fall in the Appalachian Mountains, It left more than 8.2 million homes and businesses without electricity across several states as trees toppled by fierce winds tore down power lines. New Jersey devastated With six days to go before the presidential elections, President Barack Obama will visit flood-ravaged areas of the New Jersey shore. He will tour the area with New Jersey’s Republican Governor Chris Christie, a vocal backer of presidential challenger Mitt Romney who has nevertheless praised Obama and the federal response to the storm. Governor Christie warned on Tuesday that the recovery would be long for his state, and said he had never seen destruction on this scale in his lifetime. “There are homes in the middle of Route 35, off of their foundations,” he said. “The amusement pier at Seaside Park, the log flume and the roller coaster are in the ocean. No, I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.” The number of British nationals stranded on the east coast of America by superstorm Sandy should become clearer on Wednesday, according to a senior UK diplomat. Danny Lopez, the British consul-general to New York, said that despite the impact on a large area of New York, consular staff in the US had only been contacted by 14 UK nationals over the past two days. The Google map below plots videos of the storm that were submitted by US residents and curated by Storyful. Stock exchange to reopen Late into the night on Tuesday, search teams were rescuing people stranded by floodwaters across New Jersey. There was no word on when Atlantic City’s shuttered casinos would be allowed to reopen. Assessing the damage, officials with New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority said they would release a timetable of their recovery plans sometime on Wednesday. Despite much of the city’s financial district being damaged by flooding, officials planned to reopen financial markets on Wednesday as well. How much activity could take place remained to be seen, however, as many workers may be unlikely to get to work without subways and commuter railroads from the suburbs. Sandy slows pace The remains of Hurricane Sandy slowed to 8 mph (13 kph) over Pennsylvania, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph) and was expected to continue north toward western New York and Canada, the National Weather Service said. The slowed pace meant it was dumping a lot of snow on the Appalachian Mountains, with nearly 30 inches recorded in Red House, Maryland. The storm killed 22 people in New York City, among 27 total in New York state, while six died in New Jersey. Seven other states reported fatalities. One disaster insurance company said Sandy may have caused up to $15bn in insured losses.

Read More In Wake of Sandy, NOAA Alters Hurricane Warning Policy By Andrew Freedman Published: April 4th, 2013 , Last Updated: April 4th, 2013 Ahead of the 2013 Atlantic Hurricane Season and in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the National Weather Service announced Thursday that it is changing its policy on the issuance of tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings. The changes will give forecasters more flexibility in issuing hurricane warnings, and streamline the authority for issuing such warnings. Beginning on June 1, the agency will be permitted to leave watches and warnings in effect even if a hurricane transitions into a post-tropical cyclone, which technically speaking is a different type of storm than a storm of purely tropical origins, provided that the storm still poses “a significant threat to life and property.” Satellite image of Hurricane Sandy as it strengthened over the warm ocean waters off the East Coast.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NASA/NOAA. The agency’s procedures came under criticism after forecasters decided not to issue hurricane warnings as Hurricane Sandy approached the Mid-Atlantic coast, since the storm was transitioning from a hurricane into a post-tropical storm. Based on policies in place at the time, forecasters would have had to cancel hurricane warnings once the storm completed that transition, and they feared that would confuse the public and the emergency management community. However, critics argue that by not issuing hurricane warnings at all, and instead posting a plethora of high wind, coastal flooding, and other watches and warnings, the Weather Service may have downplayed the risks from Sandy, and caused some people to remain in their homes that were then subject to the storm’s record storm surge along the New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut coastlines. According to a recent report from the reinsurance company Swiss Re, Sandy caused an estimated $70 billion in total damage and $35 billion in insured losses. In addition to allowing tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings to remain in effect after a hurricane transitions into a different type of storm, the new policy would keep the National Hurricane Center in Miami in charge of all forecast products until the storm no longer poses a significant threat. During Hurricane Sandy, responsibility was passed from the Hurricane Center to local NWS offices, which resulted in inconsistent communications and warnings being issued from one state to another. “Our forecasters now have more flexibility to effectively communicate the threat posed by transitioning tropical systems,” NWS director Louis W. Uccellini said. “Sandy’s forecast was remarkably accurate and under a similar situation in the future, forecasters will be able to choose the best option to underscore the urgency involved.” According to an NWS statement, the policy change, which was first proposed during an annual NOAA hurricane conference in November, is supported by preliminary findings from NOAA’s service assessment on Sandy, which is slated to be released in May. The NWS released an example of a statement that would be issued for a hypothetical hurricane named "Mandy," which states: "Mandy loses tropical characteristics but hurricane warnings remain in effect. Mandy expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds to the coast this afternoon."
Tag: Hurricane Sandy Snow Hurricane Sandy over the Northwestern Bahamas with 80mph winds, the cloud pattern shows a highly sheared storm – and one that is transitioning to something more of a hybrid between tropical and extra-tropical. GOES-14 high resolution 1-minute rapid scan satellite imagery. around 12pm October 26th 2012. Hurricane Sandy has been blasting through the Bahamas with some of the Central and Northwestern islands seeing a direct hit from Sandy and hurricane conditions as a result. Overnight, high southerly and south-southwesterly wind shear commenced over the center of Sandy. This has disrupted the core structure of the hurricane and injected dry air near the center – starting its transition into a more extra-tropical structure. Meanwhile, the cleanup begins in the Caribbean islands already affected and, unfortunately, reports of death and destruction have come in from Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In total, more than 20 people have reportedly died as a result of the storm. Forecast Track… Sandy made the turn to the Northwest yesterday that had it skirt the northern Bahamas delivering hurricane conditions there. This morning, its forward speed has slowed and it has turned back to the North. Tonight, Sandy should turn more to the northeast and pick up speed in response to an approaching trough currently over the Mississippi valley. By Monday, Sandy is expected to be at the latitude of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the trough has since stalled over the interior Northeast and a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along it. This wave of low pressure will turn Sandy back to the northwest, towards the Mid-Atlantic/New England coast for a potential landfall Wednesday morning. Sandy will not be fully tropical by this time, so it will have a broad wind field and the exact location of landfall becomes less important as effects spread over three hundred miles from that point. Official National Hurricane Center Hurricane Sandy track as of 11am Eastern time October 26th 2012. Forecast Impacts… The Bahamas…Hurricane conditions will subside in the northernmost islands of the Bahamas this afternoon, and tropical storm conditions should subside by Saturday afternoon. Storm surges of 3-5feet are occurring in areas of onshore winds while rainfall totals of 1-4″ are expected. Winds have likely reached near 80mph on eastern parts of Grand Bahama island and most of Little Abaco. Hurricane warnings are in effect for these islands and tropical storm warnings are in effect for the rest of the Northwest Bahamas. Florida…Tropical storm warnings are in effect along much of the East coast of Florida. Tropical storm conditions are occurring along the immediate coast in parts of Florida along with squally showers associated with Sandy. These winds are kicking up very high surf and are generating storm surges of about 1-3ft. Rainfall totals here should be around 2″. Tropical storm conditions should subside from south to north along the East Coast of Florida today and tomorrow as Sandy moves northwards and north-northeastwards. Bermuda… Tropical Storm conditions are possible on Sunday here as the wind field of this cyclone expands. A tropical storm watch is in effect as a result. Squally showers with (near) tropical storm conditions and large southwesterly swells are to be expected to start the work week here. The fact that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda and along the US East coast simultaneously suggests a storm more than 600miles in diameter. US East Coast… *Saturday morning – Monday morning: South Carolina and North Carolina (to Wilmington) will see offshore winds as Sandy passes well to the east this weekend. Tropical Storm conditions are possible mainly in the offshore marine areas here, but unlikely on land. Some showers may develop to produce some gusty winds however. Tropical storm watches are in effect along the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. There may be an area of onshore winds in the Outer Banks for a time that could produce some coastal flooding, and sound-side flooding will remain a threat for much of the storm’s passage. *Monday morning – Wednesday night: Outer Banks, NC northwards to Maine: Sandy is expected to make landfall in Southern New Jersey, near the mouth of Delaware Bay according to the National Hurricane Center’s most recent forecast. The entire New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts coasts could see: tropical storm conditions with hurricane force gusts possible, heavy rain that may lead to some inland flooding, and severe coastal flooding from a large storm tide. Meanwhile, areas inland and to the south may still see tropical storm force winds (or at least gusts to that strength), heavy potentially flooding rains, and even some snow farther inland; this could extend as far inland as Ontario and Quebec. Off shore winds, to the south of Sandy, may allow for hazardously low water levels, or coastal flooding from an unusual direction in Chesapeake Bay and the Outer Banks. Specifics of this forecast will be refined as the storm gets closer. Pay attention to emergency management messages and products/warnings from local and regional officials.

Monday, October 29, 2012 Sandy No Longer a Hurricane: 11:11pm EDT Update At 11pm EDT, the National Hurricane Center says the center of Sandy (now, no longer a hurricane) was 10 mi. southwest of Philadelphia -- which is perfectly located by this wind map. It still has winds of 75 mph (sustained) but now weakening near the center. The pressure has risen to 952 mb. Here are the forecast winds for 2am EDT Tuesday. The scale at the bottom is in knots. Multiply by 1.15 to get miles per hour. For example, 30 knots = 35 mph. click to enlarge Here is the path of the remains of Hurricane Sandy which will continue to weaken. The latest (unofficial) figure I have seen is that 5.3 million homes and businesses are without power. That translates to roughly 20,000,000 people!
More than 40 people were found dead in New York, about half of those on Staten Island, a borough across the harbour from lower Manhattan. Dozens of other casualties were also reported in New Jersey where Sandy made its landfall on Monday night. Families in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia also lost relatives, as did those to the south in Haiti and Cuba. One storm-related death was reported in Toronto, Canada – lashed by the tail of Sandy. New York’s marathon, which usually draws 40,000 runners and thousands more spectators, was scrapped amid fears that resources and manpower would be diverted from those still without power and petrol. While for the most part the lights are on in New York, swaths of the city are without electricity. The Obama administration on Friday directed the Defence Logistics Agency to buy up to 12m gallons of unleaded fuel and 10m gallons of diesel fuel for distribution to areas affected by Sandy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. In West Virginia, helicopters checked mountainous rural areas for people who may still be cut off by heavy snow Scores displaced With scores of residents still displaced because of Sandy and power outages at some polling stations, voters expected challenges on 6 November when America goes to the polls. New Jersey’s solution: vote early. The state ordered election offices to remain open through the weekend so anyone with concerns about voting on Tuesday can tick a paper ballot. “Everybody in New Jersey will have a way to vote,” Governor Chris Christie said. “It will probably take us longer to count the votes, but it will be a late night anyway.” Storm-related voting disruptions seemed unlikely to change the outcome of the presidential election, since the biggest problem areas are in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut which are all expected to go for President Obama, the New York Times reported today. But there were fears that many voters may not show up at all because they are grappling with damage to their homes or petrol shortages. On a more positive note, more subway and rail lines opened on Friday, including Amtrak’s New York to Boston route on the northeast corridor. Atlantic City casinos were told they could reopen and power was expected to return over the weekend to downtown Manhattan, where community groups were conducting door-to-door checks on the elderly and others who may not be able to navigate darkened hallways and stairwells. Cholera outbreak At least one estimate said the total US damage from the storm could at run as high as $50bn, with the cost to New York alone estimated at $18bn. Before making its landfall in New Jersey, Sandy left devastation across Haiti, where the bulk of the Caribbean deaths were felt. In its wake, the storm has triggered an outbreak of cholera. Some 300 cases are suspected and a month-long state of emergency has been declared. Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe described the situation as “frightening.” To the north, Canada and US areas along the eastern seaboard were reporting shipping delays related to Sandy. Canada was relatively unscathed, however, hit mainly with rain and cold as Sandy lost its intensity. Post-Sandy power has been restored to Toronto – Canada’s business centre – where 60,000 lost power during the peak of the crisis.

Some are calling it a “Snoreastercane.” Others have dubbed it a “Frankenstorm.” Whatever its nickname, Hurricane Sandy is bringing gale-force winds, flooding, heavy rains, and possibly even snow to the Eastern seaboard. UPDATE 21, 5:30 p.m. EDT, Thursday, November 1: Limited bus and subway service returned to New York City Thursday morning, but cars remained one of the only options for moving between boroughs. As a result, the streets of Brooklyn—which normally depends heavily on public transit—were overwhelmed with drivers, and they were all looking for one thing: gas. But the city’s main artery for this staple, the Port of New York, was closed during Hurricane Sandy and only just re-opened, leading to massive shortages, closed stations, and excruciating—and tense—lines for the pump. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Rick Ostfield of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, NY expressed concern about how the historic flooding has likely displaced hundreds or possibly thousands of rats, which could lead to the spread of rat-borne diseases: “You get infected individuals mixing with uninfected individuals and that’s a recipe for an outbreak.” People continue to take to Twitter to document the aftermath of the storm: The US death toll from Hurricane Sandy has now climbed to at least 50, including numerous victims killed by falling trees. Millions are still without power up and down the Eastern seaboard, including 684,000 in Manhattan. Con Ed officials called Sandy the worst storm in the company’s history. An explosion at a substation on the east side of Manhattan on Monday night led to the outages in Manhattan south of midtown. John Miksad, Con Ed’s senior vice president of electric operations, told the Wall Street Journal that the equipment is under several feet of water and operators are in rowboats working to pump it out, and that it could take up to a week to restore power to parts of Manhattan. Con Ed customers outside the city who lost power due to downed lines and trees may be without power for up to two weeks. The industry forecasting firm IHS Global Insight is estimating that the superstorm could cost up to $50 billion in damages and lost business. In Brooklyn, pedestrians are steering clear of standing water for fear of toxic sludge that could contain heavy metals and human waste. An apiary at the Brooklyn Navy Yard was destroyed, and 1 million honeybees were lost. A representative of the Brooklyn Grange, which managed 25 of the hives each containing about 40,000 bees, called the loss catastrophic. During a press conference this morning, Gov. Cuomo directly linked Hurricane Sandy to climate change, saying, “There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a political statement, that is a factual statement. Anyone who says there is not a dramatic change in weather patterns I think is denying reality.” There are many crazy storm photos popping up online–some legit, some fakes. They seem to be confusing many people; a friend working abroad says her colleagues keep asking her if there are really sharks swimming in the NYC subway system. In service to the public, both Buzzfeed‘s Katie Notopoulos and The Atlantic‘s Alexis Madrigal have posted great real-time fact-checking on some of the most unbelievable photos. Please check these out before tweeting any wild photos: “The federal government’s response has been great. I was on the phone at midnight again last night with the President, personally, he has expedited the designation of New Jersey as a major disaster area,” Christie, a top surrogate for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said on NBC’s “Today.” He added, “The President has been outstanding in this and so have the folks at FEMA.” On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Christie was equally laudatory, saying “the President has been all over this and he deserves great credit.” Obama, he said, “told me to call him if I needed anything and he absolutely means it, and it’s been very good working with the President and his administration.” UPDATE 14, 6:58 a.m. EDT, Tuesday, October 30: President Obama has issued a disaster declaration for New York and surrounding counties, USA Today reports, making federal aid available for those areas. In Bergen County, New Jersey, emergency responders are battling a levee breach that has reportedly sent several feet of water into three towns, and in Breezy Point, Queens, a six-alarm fire has destroyed nearly 60 homes. Up to 7 million are now without power; you can check which areas are blacked out on the Google Maps team’s Sandy map. The storm is expected to keep battering the East Coast all the way into Ontario, but winds are predicted to weaken through the day. UPDATE 13, 1:45 a.m. EDT, Tuesday, October 30: CNN tallies at least 13 US deaths so far; the New York Times reports “once-in-a-generation flooding.” Several sources say that a New York City ConEd plant exploded earlier this evening, causing massive power outages in lower Manhattan. Outlets are also reporting a large fire in the Breezy Point section of Brooklyn. In a statement early Tuesday morning, MTA chairman Joe Lhota said, “The New York City subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night.” Meanwhile, the National Weather Service predicts continuing high winds in New York and New England, more heavy rain in the mid-Atlantic, and 2-3 feet of snow in the mountains of West Virginia. UPDATE 12, 8:30 p.m. EDT, Monday, October 29: The water is starting to recede at New York City’s Battery Park, but the worst dangers of the storm may still be ahead. New York University Hospital lost power and has had to begin evacuating patients. Since many patients at the hospital are in poor health and some are on ventilators, the evacuation is very dangerous. (WYNC’s Fred Mogul reported that the hospital’s backup generator failed.) The New York Fire Department has tweeted that firefighters are on the scene at Coney Island hospital and there is no fire, despite earlier reports. There are unconfirmed reports of trouble at other area hospitals. The Metropolitan Transit Authority has confirmed that there is water in the subway tunnels under the East River—an event that the New York Timesreported in September could be a $55 billion disaster. Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the MTA, told the Weather Channel on Monday night that it would take a “significant amount of time” to get subways running again. And Long Island is now completely cut off from the mainland: all bridges and tunnels are closed. Check out this time lapse video from the Climate Desk of the Manhattan skyline awaiting Sandy: Climate Desk’s James West took to his Brooklyn rooftop to talk with his home country’s national breakfast radio show to describe what he was seeing across the city, and how he was preparing for something that might last days and days. Listen here. People continue to take to Twitter and Instagram to document the storm. According to Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom, “There are now 10 pictures per second being posted with the #sandy – most are images of people prepping for the storm and images of scenes outdoors.” Reporting from Brooklyn, Climate Desk Producer James West and Climate Desk Fellow Tim McDonnell spoke with people who were planning on staying in areas like Red Hook that have mandatory evacuations, “recalling what they thought were over-hyped precautions during last year’s Hurricane Irene disaster.”In Red Hook, a neighborhood along New York Harbor featuring low-lying land and industrial piers, sandbags weren’t enough to prevent flooding, not just of seawater but also curious tourists, locals and television vans. James West UPDATE 10, 4:15 P.M. EDT, Monday, October 29: The Coast Guard today posted this video of the harrowing rescue of 14 people from life rafts from the sunken HMS Bounty, 90 miles off the coast of Hatteras, N.C. Two people remain missing. The HMS Bounty sent out a distress beacon early this morning. The 14 people were flown to Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., where they were met by awaiting emergency medical services personnel with no life threatening injuries. Coast Guard helicopters continue to search for the two missing crewmembers. A girl with “snazzy new rainboots” on the East River at 18th Street in Manhattan posted a video shot at 11 a.m. EST of the East River overflowing its bank as an NYPD officer announces over a bullhorn that the area is a mandatory evacuation zone. An ominous NASA video shows the storm gathering steam as it approaches New York City, displaying the massive scale of the storm which has already broken the record for being the largest storm in recorded Atlantic basin history. People all up and down the East Coast have been posting their photos (real and, uh, less real, like the one above) to Twitter of the flooding and storm surge encroaching upon the landscape. According to the National Weather Service, “Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph are expected by 8 am this morning, then increasing around noon to 35 to 45 mph with hurricane force wind gusts 60 to 70 mph lasting into early Tuesday morning.” The New York Times has created an interactive map to help New Yorkers figure out whether or not they need to evacuate. Mother Jones’ Adam Serwer analyzes how Hurricane Sandy could swing the 2012 election, concluding that if it “turns out to be as bad as the meteorologists fear, it could have a real impact.” Mike Ryan, senior writer at Huffington Post Entertainment, tweets out a photo of FDR Drive in New York underwater: UPDATE 7, 10:00 p.m. EDT, Sunday, October 28: Cities from Washington to Boston were ordering mass evacuations on Sunday night and public school was cancelled for all of New York City, Boston, Washington, Baltimore, and many of their suburbs. Airlines canceled more than 5,000 flights, and Amtrak began suspending train service across the Northeast. President Obama today reviewed emergency response plans with FEMA administrator Craig Fugate in advance of what the president has called a “serious and big storm.” He urged residents in the path of the storm to heed the warnings and directions of their local emergency officials and to leave their homes if evacuation is deemed necessary. A high-wind warning will go into effect Monday at 6 a.m. (EDT) for New York City, with gusts expected to reach 80 mph. People living in the strike zone, especially those in high rise buildings above the 10th floor, are warned to stay away from windows as flying debris could pose a threat. The National Guard has called upon 61,000 troops to prepare for storm response. UPDATE 6, 3:00 p.m. EDT, Sunday, October 28: Sandy is threatening to bring significant storm surge flooding to Long Island Sound and New York Harbor with winds near hurricane force at landfall, according to the Sunday afternoon bulletin from NOAA which was tracking the hurricane about 270 miles off the coat of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina. Heavy snow is also forecast in the Appalachian Mountains. The death toll in the Caribbean is up to 65. Already hundreds of flights have been canceled and mass transit systems are shutting down all along the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in advance of the storm which is supposed to make landfall in Southern New Jersey by late Monday or early Tuesday. With just over a week before the election, President Obama has scrapped campaign plans for Monday and Tuesday to focus on storm response, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney has been scrambling his schedule, canceling events in Virginia and joining running mate Paul Ryan in Ohio. For those in the path of the hurricane looking for infomation, the Red Cross has a Hurricane App which will allow users to monitor conditions in their area or throughout the storm track, prepare their family and home, find help and let others know they are safe even if the power is out. UPDATE 4, 1:00 p.m. EDT, Saturday, October 27: Early Saturday morning, Sandy was briefly downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, but hurricane strength winds were observed a few hours later. According to an update from NOAA at 11 am EST, tropical storm watches and warnings for the east coast of Florida have been discontinued, but they are in effect for areas in South and North Carolina, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph and the storm is expected to move parallel to the southeastern coast of the US throughout the weekend. Gale force winds, storm surge, and rainfall from four to eight inches are likely to reach the Mid-Atlantic coast by Sunday evening. Some are predicting that Sandy will make landfall in Delaware on Tuesday, and Maine, New Jersey, and Connecticut have joined North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, D.C., Pennsylvania and New York in declaring a state of emergency. According to the NY Daily News, city officials are considering evacuating 375,000 New Yorkers and three to six feet of water could be seen in subways in a worst cast scenario. AccuWeather senior meteorologist Henry Margusity warned MarketWatch, “There will be school closures, travel will be messed up for days and major airports will be closed. This could be a disaster of biblical proportions – a multi-billion dollar disaster.” UPDATE 2, 2:45 p.m. EDT, Friday, October 26: The latest weather models show Sandy on a collision course with the mid-Atlantic and Northeast with 50 million people in its projected path. The Capitol Weather Gang at the Washington Post is predicting a one-in-three chance of a direct hit on New York City, in which case city officials may call for evacuations as a storm surge could flood parts of Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Many are freaking out about this storm. On his blog, Accuweather meterologist Mike Smith quoted a “prominent National Weather Service meteorologist” as saying: I’ve never seen anything like this and I’m at a loss for expletives to describe what this storm could do. The National Hurricane Center says Sandy is moving slowly due north at about six mph with wind speeds of up to 80 mph and are calling the storm a hybrid with tropical characteristics. Eric Holthaus, contributing meteorologist at the Wall Street Journal, said a midwestern snow storm is currently generating over the Great Lakes and will pull the hurricane inland. The full moon on Monday could play a role in coastal flooding, bringing higher tides. He said a direct strike on New York City might actually be a better scenario than if the storm hits in Southern Jersey as it is currently forecasted to do. Coastal flooding could bring a storm surge between six to 10 feet in the city in a worst-case scenario, he said. The financial markets, utilities, and the tourism industry are also bracing for impact with storm damage estimates already predicted at upwards of $1 billion. UPDATE 1, 1:10 p.m. EDT Friday, October 26: During a teleconference call on Friday morning, James Franklin, branch chief of NOAA’s National Hurricane Center, predicted that the coastline from Florida up through through North Carolina will experience peripheral impacts from Sandy through Sunday, and that the storm will move north to Virginia through New England Monday through Wednesday. The expectation is that the storm will move slowly and there will be two or three days of impacts for many people. According to Dr. Louis Uccellini, director of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction, the West Virginia and Appalachian area could potentially get one to two feet of snow, and there is likely a risk of river flooding in Delaware and Pennsylvania. New York City may experience tropical storm force winds as well as flash flooding. “Someone is going to get a significant surge event out of this, much broader than Irene,” said Franklin. It’s possible, according to AccuWeather. They suspect that as the storm batters the east coast at the end of this week and into next week, early voting may seem less appealing to those planning on heading to the polls. Several of the states that might be hit by the storm, such as Florida, Maryland, D.C., Vermont, and Maine, allow for in-person early voting. According to AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno, “The worst case scenario is that if this storm does go up into New England…we could see lots of power outages, we could see flooding. That could have an impact even a week later, depending on how bad the storm is.” A recent survey conducted by the Weather Channel showed that 35 percent of undecided likely voters would be less inclined to head to the polls if there is bad weather on Election Day. Possibly. NOAA scientists have shied away from blaming human activities and climate change outright on the more active hurricane seasons in recent years. However, they do say that anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause hurricanes globally to be more intense on average.Forecasters have also said warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures and wind patterns that favor storm formation mean chances are higher for an above-normal season.

After all, New York is a seaside city -- four of When most New Yorkers hear "hurricane" or "tropical storm," they probably think of the gulf states. But New York can and does get hit by tropical storms. After all, New York is a seaside city -- four of the five boroughs are either islands or parts of an island. In fact, a direct hit by a major storm can be crippling and even devastating if residents and city officials don't take the right precautions. Since flooding and high winds can occur many hours before a hurricane makes landfall, it is critical evacuees leave their homes immediately if instructed to do so by emergency officials. Evacuees are encouraged to seek shelter with friends or family or outside evacuation zones when possible. To avoid being trapped by flooded roads, washed-out bridges or disruptions to mass transportation, evacuees should plan their mode of transportation with special care. Plan to use mass transit as much as possible, as it offers the fastest way to reach your destination. Using mass transit reduces the volume of evacuees on the roadways, reducing the risk of dangerous and time-consuming traffic delays. Listen carefully to your local news media, which will broadcast reports about weather and transportation conditions. Evacuations from at-risk zones will be phased to encourage residents in coastal areas to leave their homes before inland residents and to help ensure an orderly evacuation process. Leave early. Evacuations will need to be completed before winds and flooding become a threat, because wind and heavy rain could force the early closure of key transportation routes, like bridges and tunnels. The City advises against car travel during an evacuation. The City will be working hard to keep roads clear, but traffic is unavoidable in any evacuation. Driving will increase your risk of becoming stranded on a roadway during an evacuation.
Site Mobile Navigation Storm Barrels Through Region, Leaving Destructive Path Hurricane Sandy battered the mid-Atlantic region on Monday, its powerful gusts and storm surges causing once-in-a-generation flooding in coastal communities, knocking down trees and power lines and leaving more than five million people — including a large swath of Manhattan — in the rain-soaked dark. At least seven deaths in the New York region were tied to the storm. The mammoth and merciless storm made landfall near Atlantic City around 8 p.m., with maximum sustained winds of about 80 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center said. That was shortly after the center had reclassified the storm as a post-tropical cyclone, a scientific renaming that had no bearing on the powerful winds, driving rains and life-threatening storm surge expected to accompany its push onto land. The storm had unexpectedly picked up speed as it roared over the Atlantic Ocean on a slate-gray day and went on to paralyze life for millions of people in more than a half-dozen states, with extensive evacuations that turned shorefront neighborhoods into ghost towns. Even the superintendent of the Statue of Liberty left to ride out the storm at his mother’s house in New Jersey ; he said the statue itself was “high and dry,” but his house in the shadow of the torch was not. The wind-driven rain lashed sea walls and protective barriers in places like Atlantic City, where the Boardwalk was damaged as water forced its way inland. Foam was spitting, and the sand gave in to the waves along the beach at Sandy Hook, N.J., at the entrance to New York Harbor. Water was thigh-high on the streets in Sea Bright, N.J., a three-mile sand-sliver of a town where the ocean joined the Shrewsbury River. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ’s office said late Monday night that at least five deaths in the state were attributable to the storm. At least three of those involved falling trees. About 7 p.m., a tree fell on a house in Queens , killing a 30-year-old man, the city police said. About the same time, two boys, ages 11 and 13, were killed in North Salem in Westchester County, when a tree fell on the house they were in, according to the State Police. In Morris County, N.J., a man and a woman were killed when a tree fell on their car Monday evening, The Associated Press reported. In Manhattan, NYU Langone Medical Center’s backup power system failed Monday evening, forcing the evacuation of patients to other facilities. In a Queens beach community, nearly 200 firefighters were battling a huge blaze early on Tuesday morning that tore through more than 50 tightly-packed homes in an area where heavy flooding slowed responders. Earlier, a construction crane atop one of the tallest buildings in the city came loose and dangled 80 stories over West 57th Street, across the street from Carnegie Hall . Soon power was going out and water was rushing in. Waves topped the sea wall in the financial district in Manhattan, sending cars floating downstream. West Street, along the western edge of Lower Manhattan, looked like a river. The Brooklyn -Battery Tunnel, known officially as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel in memory of a former governor, flooded “from end to end,” the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said, hours after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York ordered it closed to traffic.Officials said water also seeped into seven subway tunnels under the East River. Joseph J. Lhota , the transit authority chairman, called the storm the most devastating disaster in the 108-year history of the subway system. “We could be fishing out our windows tomorrow,” said Garnett Wilcher, a barber who lives in the Hammells Houses, a block from the ocean in the Rockaways in Queens. Still, he said he felt safe at home. Pointing to neighboring apartment houses in the city-run housing project, he said, “We got these buildings for jetties.” Hurricane-force winds extended up to 175 miles from the center of the storm; tropical-storm-force winds spread out 485 miles from the center. Forecasters said tropical-storm-force winds could stretch all the way north to Canada and all the way west to the Great Lakes . Snow was expected in some states. Businesses and schools were closed; roads, bridges and tunnels were closed; and more than 13,000 airline flights were canceled. Even the Erie Canal was shut down. Subways were shut down from Boston to Washington, as were Amtrak and the commuter rail lines. About 1,000 flights were canceled at each of the three major airports in the New York City area. Philadelphia International Airport had 1,200 canceled flights, according to FlightAware, a data provider in Houston . And late Monday night, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said cabs had been instructed to get off New York City roads. A replica of the H.M.S. Bounty, a tall ship built for the 1962 movie “Mutiny on the Bounty” starring Marlon Brando and used in the recent “Pirates of the Caribbean” series, sank off the North Carolina coast. The Coast Guard said the 180-foot three-masted ship went down near the Outer Banks after being battered by 18-foot-high seas and thrashed by 40-m.p.h. winds. The body of one crew member, Claudene Christian, 42, was recovered. Another crew member remained missing. Delaware banned cars and trucks from state roadways for other than “essential personnel.” “The most important thing right now is for people to use common sense,” Gov. Jack Markell said. “We didn’t want people out on the road going to work and not being able to get home again.” Photo The Red Hook section of Brooklyn was flooded on Monday.Credit Robert Stolarik for The New York Times By early evening, the storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes, stores and office buildings. Consolidated Edison said that as of 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, 634,000 customers in New York City and Westchester County were without power. Con Edison, fearing damage to its electrical equipment, shut down power pre-emptively in sections of Lower Manhattan on Monday evening, and then, at 8:30 p.m., an unplanned failure, probably caused by flooding in substations, knocked out power to most of Manhattan below Midtown, about 250,000 customers. Later, an explosion at a Con Ed substation on East 14th Street knocked out power to another 250,000 customers. In New Jersey, more than two million customers were without power as of 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, and in Connecticut nearly 500,000. President Obama , who returned to the White House and met with top advisers, said Monday that the storm would disrupt the rhythms of daily life in the states it hit. “Transportation is going to be tied up for a long time,” he said, adding that besides flooding, there would probably be widespread power failures. He said utility companies had lined up crews to begin making repairs. But he cautioned that it could be slow going. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. “The fact is, a lot of these emergency crews are not going to get into position to start restoring power until some of these winds die down,” the president said. He added, “That may take several days.” Forecasters attributed the power of the storm to a convergence of weather systems. As the hurricane swirled north in the Atlantic and then pivoted toward land, a wintry storm was heading toward it from the west, and cold air was blowing south from the Arctic . The hurricane left more than 60 people dead in the Caribbean before it began crawling toward the Northeast. “The days ahead are going to be very difficult, Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland said. “There will be people who die and are killed in this storm,” he said. Alex Sosnowski, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, said potentially damaging winds would continue on Tuesday from Illinois to the Carolinas — and as far north as Maine — as the storm barreled toward the eastern Great Lakes. Mr. Cuomo, who ordered many of the most heavily used bridges and tunnels in New York City closed, warned that the surge from Hurricane Sandy could go two feet higher than that associated with Tropical Storm Irene last year. The PATH system, buses and the Staten Island Ferry system were also suspended. Mr. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has said he expected to restore at least some service about 12 hours after the storm ended. But possible flooding within the subway system could prevent a full-scale reopening. The storm headed toward land with weather that was episodic: a strong gust of wind one minute, then mist. More wind. Thin sheets of rain dancing down the street. Then, for a moment, nothing. The sky lightened. Then another blast of rain. Then more wind. The day brought a giddiness to schoolchildren who had the day off and to grown-ups who were fascinated by the rough, rising water. Some went surfing , discounting the danger. Felquin Piedra, 38, rode his Jet Ski from Queens to Lower Manhattan. “I love the waves,” Mr. Piedra yelled from New York Harbor. “The water is warm. I’ve jumped in several times.” But even when landfall was still hours away, there was no holding back the advance guard of the storm — fast-moving bands of rain and punishing winds. It added up to devastation. Driving through places like Pompton Plains, N.J., late Monday afternoon was like an X-Games contest for drivers. They had to do tree-limb slaloms on side streets and gunned their engines anxiously as they passed wind funnels of leaves swirling on highways. On City Island, off the Bronx mainland, Cheryl Brinker sprayed “Sandy Stay Away” on her boarded-up art studio, expanding a collage she started during Tropical Storm Irene last year. But by midafternoon, nearby Ditmars Street was under as much as five feet of water and Steve Van Wickler said the water had cracked the cement in his cellar. “It’s like a little river running in my basement,” he said. “There are cracks and leaks everywhere.” In some places, caravans of power-company trucks traveled largely empty roads; Public Service Electric and Gas said that 600 line workers and 526 tree workers had arrived from across the country, but could not start the repairs and cleanup until the wind had subsided, perhaps not until Wednesday. They will see a landscape that, in many places, was remade by the storm. In Montauk, at the end of Long Island , a 50-seat restaurant broke in half. Half of the building floated away and broke into pieces on the beach. The 110-foot-tall lighthouse at Montauk Point — the oldest in the state, opened in 1796 — shuddered in the storm despite walls that are six feet thick at the base. The lighthouse keeper, Marge Winski, said she had never felt anything like that in 26 years on the job. “I went up in tower and it was vibrating, it was shaking,” she said. “I got out of it real quick. I’ve been here through hurricanes, and nor’easters, but nothing this bad.” A version of this article appears in print on October 30, 2012, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: STORM PICKS UP SPEED AND DISRUPTS MILLIONS OF LIVES.

Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Worrying Beyond Hurricane Sandy It is small comfort to sodden and stranded New Yorkers that Hurricane Sandy’s flooding of the city’s infrastructure, from power lines to subways to low-lying communities, was predicted in grimly precise detail by scientists in the latest state and city climate studies. Deeper and more frequent flooding from Rockaway to Lower Manhattan and the city’s transit tunnels has been a repeated warning that largely went unnoticed by the public and most politicians. But now, with the floods from Sandy and Tropical Storm Irene last year on his watch, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pointedly stressing what he considers the inevitability of more such disasters. “Climate change is reality,” the governor said Wednesday, estimating Sandy’s economic damage up to $6 billion. “Given the frequency of these extreme weather situations that we’ve had — and I believe that it’s an increasing frequency — for us to sit here today and say this is a once-in-a-generation and it’s not going to happen again, I think would be shortsighted.” Mr. Cuomo admits that he does not have all the answers nor enough government money for all the proposed solutions. And we can all hope that he is wrong in his forecast. But the urgency of his warning is rooted in a basic fact of nature underpinning the government studies: New York’s coastal waters, which rose an inch per decade in the last century, are heading toward rates of 6 inches per decade as the oceans warm and expand. That would be a disastrous rise of 2 feet across the next 40 years, for anyone planning ahead. And there aren’t many in government planning ahead as the postrecession political debate grinds along the question of how to slash government improvements, not expand them. Just last September, Klaus Jacob, an adviser to the city on climate change, warned of the certainty of flooded Manhattan highways and tunnels and of stranded subway riders and subway commuters if the next storm surge topped Irene’s. “I’m disappointed that the political process hasn’t recognized that we’re playing Russian roulette,” said Mr. Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute and an author of a 2011 state study that predicted tens of billions in economic losses from worsening floods. This is why the problem underlined by Mr. Cuomo deserves heightened public debate. Mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed. "What’s clear is that the storms that we’ve experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are much more severe than before,” the mayor said. “Whether that’s global warming or what, I don’t know. But we’ll have to address those issues.” Mr. Cuomo proposed consideration of the sort of storm surge barriers in use in Europe. Gates like those guarding London’s riverfront could be closed in disastrous weather at three main points of ocean inflow — the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the upper East River and the mouth of the Arthur Kill between Staten Island and New Jersey. This idea and others involve billions of dollars, which could be a bargain if Sandy and Irene truly are harbingers of more frequent disasters eating deeper into the city’s heart. The governor offered far more welcome words in an announcement that limited parts of mass transit would go back on line. But he did not and should not retreat from his climate agenda, even if a surge in political resolve is lacking. “I don’t think most people would agree with me at this point,” Mr. Cuomo said. “First, you have to convince the citizenry, then get the elected officials to move.” A version of this editorial appears in print on November 1, 2012, on Page A30 of the New York edition with the headline: Worrying Beyond Hurricane Sandy.

Read More New York Launches $19.5 Billion Climate Resiliency Plan By Andrew Freedman Published: June 11th, 2013 , Last Updated: June 11th, 2013 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced a far-reaching $19.5 billion plan on Tuesday to boost the city’s capacity to withstand future extreme weather events, including events comparable to Hurricane Sandy, or worse. The proposal calls for everything from constructing “adaptable floodwalls,” storm-surge barriers and dune systems, to revising building codes throughout the city.

Underlying the portfolio of measures, which amount to the most comprehensive climate resilience program of any city worldwide, are a recognition that climate change is increasing the risks of damaging storm-surge events in New York by rising sea levels, and that climate change is also likely to worsen heat waves, heavy precipitation events, and other extremes. The plan, which was outlined in a 430-page report, contains more than 250 recommendations, many of which Bloomberg said will be implemented immediately. Bloomberg made the announcement at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which was heavily damaged during the storm, and reminded his audience that his administration only has 203 days left in office. The new data from the climate science panel shows that sea levels could rise at a faster rate than was thought just four years ago, with up to 11 inches of sea level rise by the 2020s, and an upper-level estimate of more than 2.5 feet of sea level rise by the 2050s. The climate science panel also found that the city could have three times as many days at or above 90°F by the 2050s. Heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. The city’s proposals, if they are all enacted, would cost upwards of $19.5 billion. Hurricane Sandy alone caused an estimated $19 billion in damage and economic losses to the city, according to City Hall. Bloomberg said the investments are necessary to prevent increasingly expensive and damaging storms, noting that a Sandy-like storm could cost $90 billion by mid-century as sea levels rise in response to melting glaciers and warming seas. Sea level rise exacerbates storm-surge flooding by giving storms a higher launching pad for the surge and waves to ride on top of. The storm surge from Hurricane Sandy at The Battery in Lower Manhattan was the highest ever recorded at that location. To pay for the initiative, Bloomberg said $15 billion has already been provided through previously allocated city capital spending and federal disaster relief measures. That leaves a gap of $4.5 billion, which the mayor said he intends to seek from the federal government. “We'll press the Federal government to cover as much of the remaining costs as possible,” he said. Newly released flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have put hundreds of thousands more New Yorkers in the 100-year floodplain compared to the maps that were in effect when Hurricane Sandy struck. "We expect that by mid-century up to one-quarter of all of New York City's land area, where 800,000 residents live today, will be in the floodplain. If we do nothing, more than 40 miles of our waterfront could see flooding on a regular basis, just during normal high tide,” Bloomberg said.

"We can do nothing and expose ourselves to an increasing frequency of Sandy-like storms that do more and more damage, or we can abandon the waterfront. Or, we can make the investments necessary to build a stronger, more resilient New York — investments that will pay for themselves many times over in the years to come,” Bloomberg said. "I strongly believe we have to prepare for what the scientists say is a likely scenario. Whether you believe climate change is real or not is beside the point — we can't run the risk.” On Staten Island, which suffered the highest death toll (19 killed) of the city’s five boroughs, the city plans to build 15- to 20-foot tall levees, floodwalls, and other protective devices along the island’s eastern shore. Those would provide more protection for areas such as Midland Beach, near where many of the deaths occurred. The city’s plans call for integrated flood protection systems that would prevent similar surge-related flooding during storms while allowing access to the waterfront during calmer weather. Such systems function much like building blocks, with some permanent infrastructure installed and other temporary measures that could be added before a storm strikes. The report called for these systems to be put in place in parts of the Bronx and on the lower east side of Manhattan, where Hurricane Sandy sent the East River over its banks, forcing the hasty evacuation of two major hospitals. Other coastal barriers that would be constructed under the plan include dune systems in Staten Island and the Rockaway Peninsula, which was another area that was dealt an especially severe blow by Sandy. The proposal also called for a number of studies by the city and the Army Corps of Engineers, including a study of the construction of a large commercial and real estate development that would be built on top of a levee along the East River shoreline, tentatively named “Seaport City.” It would be modeled after Battery Park City, a recent development on Manhattan’s southwestern edge, which did not flood because it was built on elevated land. No harbor-wide surge barrier, and no retreat The plan does not call for studying or constructing a storm-surge barrier at the entrance to New York Harbor, which has been proposed by a number of researchers and engineers as a way to ensure adequate flood protection, but would cost several billion dollars. Bloomberg said it was not under consideration. “Even though a giant barrier across our entire harbor is not practical, or affordable, smaller surge barriers are feasible — and they could have prevented a lot of the flooding we saw during Sandy,” Bloomberg said. The mayor also rejected outright the notion that some of the most vulnerable neighborhoods would need to be ceded to the rising sea. That stance puts him in opposition to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D), who has established a state-run buyback program for willing homeowners to sell their damaged property in some of the state’s hardest hit and most vulnerable neighborhoods, rather than rebuilding. An artist rendering of the proposed "Seaport City" development in Manhattan.Click image to enlarge. Credit: NYC Mayor's Office. "To illustrate the futility of retreat, consider that within FEMA's new 100-year flood maps there are more than 500 million square feet of New York City buildings — equivalent to the entire city of Minneapolis. These communities are home to almost 400,000 people and more than 270,000 jobs,” Bloomberg said. "They are not going anywhere, and we cannot and will not abandon them. It's up to us to make these communities stronger and safer. And that goes for all communities that could be impacted by a storm, not just those hit hard by Sandy.” Some scientists said the mayor may be making a mistake by avoiding open discussions of retreat, and that he may want to reconsider his opposition to the harbor entrance surge barrier, as well. Radley Horton, a climate researcher at Columbia University and a member of the city climate panel’s technical team, said that while New York is taking ambitious steps to cope with climate challenge, some parts of the city may prove too difficult to defend in the long run against rising seas and potentially stronger storms. “There’s no avoiding the fact that retreat, in select locations at least, is increasingly going to be part of the discussion,” Horton said. Malcolm Bowman, a professor of physical oceanography at SUNY Stony Brook, has long been an advocate of the harbor surge barrier. In an interview, he said the city should request that the Army Corps of Engineers study the idea, and he took issue with Bloomberg’s stance. “I think he’s wrong," Bowman said. "I don’t know why he has that view, because he has an engineering background. “The engineering is not rocket science. It’s well-established in Europe,” Bowman said, citing the Netherlands and Russia as examples of countries that have successfully implemented such large-scale barriers. In the U.S., smaller-scale harbor barriers have been constructed in Stamford, Conn., Providence, R.I., and New Bedford, Mass. New York's plan is more than just barriers and levees The city’s climate resilience plan goes far beyond dealing with the thorny questions of how to bolster coastal defenses. It also includes a $1.2 billion loan or grant program to help building owners to complete flood resiliency projects, including elevating critical building equipment. The city has previously announced the spending of a federally provided $530 million to rebuild and retrofit properties damaged by Hurricane Sandy. The city is also proposing to develop a system that would allow homeowners to undertake flood mitigation measures in order to qualify for reduced flood insurance premiums. Under current federal guidelines, flood insurance premiums can only be reduced if buildings are elevated, which is not feasible in most cases in New York City. Another focus of the plan concerns the privately owned utilities that serve the city. During Hurricane Sandy, a swath of Manhattan lost power when a Con Edison substation was swamped with floodwaters, and the new proposal calls for utility companies to ensure they are preparing for climate change-related impacts. According to a fact sheet accompanying the proposal, 53 percent of the city’s power plants are currently in the 100-year floodplain. By the 2050s, however, that would rise to 97 percent. The plan also calls for the establishment of storm resiliency requirements for telecommunications companies.

Hurricane Sandy menaces U.S. after slamming Cuba HAVANA (Reuters) - Hurricane Sandy swelled into a major threat to much of the U.S. East Coast on Thursday after lashing Cuba with heavy rains and tree-toppling winds and swirling through the Bahamas, U.S. forecasters said. Strengthening rapidly after tearing into Jamaica and crossing the warm Caribbean Sea, Sandy hit southeastern Cuba early on Thursday with top sustained winds up to 110 miles per hour that left a trail of destruction, especially in the historic city of Santiago de Cuba. Images on Cuban television showed downed trees, damaged buildings and debris-clogged streets in the communist-ruled island’s second largest city, which suffered a direct hit when the storm came ashore in the early morning hours. “Everything’s destroyed in Santiago. People are going to have to work very hard to recover,” Alexis Manduley, a resident of the 498-year-old city, told Reuters by telephone. According to one Cuban radio report from the city of 500,000 people, about 470 miles southeast of Havana, at least one person was killed in Santiago, bringing the Sandy-related death toll to at least three, including fatalities in Jamaica and Haiti. U.S. government forecasters warned that much of the U.S. East Coast could get swiped by Sandy, with flooding, heavy rains and high winds beginning late Thursday in Florida. By early next week - amid final preparations for the crucial November 6 presidential election - the storm could hit an area of New England where Hurricane Irene caused severe damage last year. White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to speculate about whether there would be any change in President Barack Obama’s campaign travel schedule because of Sandy, as he makes a last-minute blitz to win an edge over Republican Mitt Romney in a close race. “The president’s concern about this storm is to make sure that citizens in potentially affected areas are aware of this and taking necessary precaution,” Carney said. He spoke aboard Air Force One as Obama headed from Florida to Virginia, saying the president had asked his team to hold regular briefings with federal disaster officials as the storm progresses. Forecasters said the hardest-hit areas could span anywhere from the coastal Carolinas up to Maine, with New York City and the Boston area potentially in harm’s way. “Regardless of the exact track of Sandy, it is likely that significant impacts will be felt over portions of the U.S. East Coast through the weekend and into early next week,” the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. “FRANKENSTORM” “It’s going to be a high-impact event,” said Bob Oravec, a lead forecaster with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s HydroMeteorological Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “It has the potential to be a very significant storm with respect to coastal flooding, depending on exactly where it comes in. Power outages are definitely a big threat,” he said. In a subsequent report, NOAA’s storm-prediction center suggested that Sandy could invite the ghoulish nickname “Frankenstorm,” due to upcoming celebrations of Halloween and some of the freakish characteristics of the storm.

Hurricane Sandy battered Jamaica with ferocious winds, waves and rain on Wednesday, knocking down trees and power lines across the Caribbean country as it cut a path toward Cuba and the Bahamas. REUTERS/Desmond Boylan The late-season cyclone is widely expected to undergo an unusual merger with a polar air mass over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Tuesday, essentially bringing two sources of energy together and giving Sandy the potential to punch above its weight as it sloshes across the U.S. coast. At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), the NHC said Sandy was about 125 miles east-southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas and packing maximum sustained winds of 105 mph. It was still a Category 2 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, but some weakening was expected over the next 48 hours as Sandy moved through the Bahamas island chain. High winds, rains and pounding surf are expected across parts of Florida’s Atlantic coast, with the biggest impact lasting through Friday. Orange juice prices rose in U.S. trading on Thursday on speculative buying as investors bet that Sandy could damage crops in the citrus-rich Sunshine State. Unlike Irene, which caused billions of dollars in damage as it battered the Northeast in August last year, Sandy is forecast to drop below hurricane strength before making U.S. landfall. But it will be moving slower than Irene did, likely bringing more rain and increasing its potential for damage, weather forecasters said. At $4.3 billion in losses, Irene ranks as one of the 10 costliest hurricanes, adjusted for inflation and excluding federally insured damage, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. “A BILLION-DOLLAR DISASTER” Jeff Masters, a hurricane specialist and blogger with private forecaster Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com), said a landfall by Sandy on Monday along the Mid-Atlantic Coast could trigger “a billion-dollar disaster.” “In this scenario, Sandy would be able to bring sustained winds near hurricane force over a wide stretch of heavily populated coast,” he said. Alternately, Masters said, some computer forecast models indicated Sandy had the potential to unleash “the heaviest October rains ever reported in the northeast U.S., Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.” Oravec said there could be tropical-storm to hurricane-force winds on the coast and added: “Coastal flooding will be a big concern.” On Long Island, in the southeast corner of the Bahamas island chain, Joel Friese, general manager of the Stella Maris Resort, said Sandy was fierce as she cut across the island Thursday afternoon. “It was way stronger than we expected. The eye seems to have passed over a good portion of Long Island from south to north. We had winds of 100 mph from the east until the eye passed,” he said by telephone. “There are lots of downed trees and partial to heavy roof damage on some of the buildings.” Sandy is expected to hit the United States during a full moon, increasing the flood potential since tides will be at or near their highest. “There’s a big potential for huge effects from the storm,” said NOAA’s Oravec.

Read More Hurricane Sandy Set To Deliver Massive Blow to East Coast By Andrew Freedman Published: October 28th, 2012 , Last Updated: October 28th, 2012 Hurricane Sandy is poised to deliver a potentially historic and devastating blow to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with a record storm surge predicted for New York City and coastal Connecticut. Hurricane force wind gusts are expected to lash areas from near Washington D.C., all the way to Cape Cod, as a storm of unparalleled strength and size takes a track that is virtually unprecedented — almost due east to west — as it comes ashore in central to northern New Jersey. The storm, which is part hurricane, part nor'easter, is expected to eventually affect the entire eastern third of the country with everything from inland flooding to mountain snows. The storm's effects may be felt all the way inland to the Great Lakes, and northward as far as Toronto. At least 10 million people may lose power, according to an analysis from Johns Hopkins University, as winds are projected to gust as high as 80 mph in the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas, with damaging winds eventually spreading well inland. New York City has already taken steps to evacuate 375,000 residents.

Officials said the storm’s large size — it has already set a record for its expansive wind field, with tropical storm force winds extending more than 500 miles from the storm's center — makes it a fearsome coastal flood threat. “Sandy is a large hurricane, and large systems pose multiple hazards for more people than smaller systems of comparable intensity,” said National Hurricane Center director Rick Knabb during a media briefing on Sunday. Beginning Monday morning, high winds are expected to rake the Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston, with maximum gusts from Chincoteague, Va., to Chatham, Mass., reaching hurricane force (greater than 74 mph) on Monday night into Tuesday morning. That includes New York City, Long Island, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The strong winds, along with power outages, are forecast to spread well inland into Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and as far west as Ohio by midweek, as the storm slowly meanders over the eastern third of the country. Evacuations ordered for New York City residents As projected, the center of Sandy would be to the northeast of the Carolinas on Sunday, and then hook northwest and approach the coast in southern to central New Jersey late Monday or early Tuesday. Sandy's track has no historical comparison, and would be a worst-case scenario for New York City and Southern New England because of the tremendous east-to-southeasterly winds, which will drive water toward New York Harbor and coastal Connecticut, possibly breaking flood records that have stood since the 19th century. The threat to New York City is particularly dire, since storm surge models are projecting that the surge will be considerably larger than during Hurricane Irene in 2011, when there was only minor coastal flooding. The city’s subway tunnels are extremely vulnerable to coastal flooding, and a disaster was averted by mere inches during Irene, making it more likely that flooding will occur in some sections of the system this time, particularly in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. If the tunnels do flood, as suggested by the storm surge forecasts, it could cripple the lifeblood of transportation in and around the city for an extended period. In light of the flood threat, New York City officials decided to shut down the entire mass transit system starting at 7 p.m. on Sunday. It's only the second time such a step has been taken, and the second year in a row it has been ordered. In addition, on Sunday morning New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered the mandatory evacuation of about 375,000 people living in flood-prone areas of the city. Bloomberg had been criticized by meteorologists for not ordering the evacuation on Saturday, despite weather warnings.

During Hurricane Irene, the city recorded a 4.13 foot storm surge at The Battery in Lower Manhattan, and the total water level (how high the water got when looking at both the tide and storm surge) peaked at 9.5 feet. As of Sunday morning, a National Weather Service computer model was projecting a peak storm tide — the water level reached when combining storm surge plus the tide — of 11.7 feet, with a surge component of more than 5 feet (relative to Mean Lower Low Water Level (MLLW)). If that water level were to verify, it would break the record of 10.5 feet set on Sept. 15, 1960 during Hurricane Donna, the National Weather Service said. Other models put the projected storm surge closer to the level seen during Irene. In fact, the National Hurricane Center is predicting that water will reach between 6 and 11 feet above ground level if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. "GIVEN THE LARGE WIND FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH SANDY . . . ELEVATED WATER LEVELS COULD SPAN MULTIPLE TIDE CYCLES RESULTING IN REPEATED AND EXTENDED PERIODS OF COASTAL AND BAYSIDE FLOODING," the Hurricane Center said. Timing will be key to determining the storm surge and extent of the associated damage, since if the peak onshore winds occur around the time of high tide, that will maximize the surge. “A long duration coastal flood event is expected,” the National Weather Service said. “The potential is increasing for significant inundation and moderate damage to structures in historically flood-prone spots. Record coastal flooding may also occur in coastal Connecticut, as strong east-to-southeasterly winds drive the waters of Long Island Sound toward the coast." In addition to coastal flooding, high surf, with waves offshore measuring at least 30 feet in height, will help cause significant beach erosion. Hurricane Sandy is noteworthy not just for its size, but also for its intensity. If the storm were to make landfall at its current intensity, it would set records for the lowest air-pressure readings ever recorded in New Jersey and coastal New York, beating benchmark storms such as the 1938 hurricane. However, many computer models project that the storm will intensify further prior to coming ashore. In part, the storm is feeding off of much warmer-than-average ocean waters located off the East Coast. Sea surface temperatures hit record highs off the New Jersey and New England coasts this summer, and warmer water can help maintain a hurricane, or hurricane-like hybrid storm, much farther north than they would typically be able to survive at this time of year. Sandy is tapping into energy from both the ocean and the jet stream, as researcher Adam Sobel explained. The multifaceted storm is expected to dump upwards of 5-to-10 inches of rain or more along its path, potentially leading to extensive inland flooding. On top of that, as cold air wraps into its circulation, rain may change to snow in the higher elevations of Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, potentially dumping upwards of 2-to-3 feet in some locations. Climate Change Connection? The storm track is being influenced by an unusually strong "blocking" pattern in the upper atmosphere, with a massive dome of high pressure located southwest of Greenland. Without this blocking, the storm would have been able to turn out to sea, without harming the U.S. It's an example of what can happen when blocking patterns appear at precisely the wrong time. Additionally, there are many other ingredients that are converging to create a menacing situation, including a deep dip in the jet stream across the eastern U.S. that is playing a role in essentially capturing the storm and flinging it inland. "History is being written as an extreme weather event continues to unfold, one which will occupy a place in the annals of weather history as one of the most extraordinary to have affected the United States," wrote Weather Channel senior meteorologist Stu Ostro. "A meteorologically mind-boggling combination of ingredients is coming together: one of the largest expanses of tropical storm (gale) force winds on record with a tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic or for that matter anywhere else in the world; a track of the center making a sharp left turn in direction of movement toward New Jersey in a way that is unprecedented in the historical database; a 'warm-core' tropical cyclone embedded within a larger, nor'easter-like circulation; and eventually tropical moisture and arctic air combining to produce heavy snow in interior high elevations," Ostro said. Recent studies, including Ostro's own work, have shown that blocking patterns such as the one that is currently over the Atlantic have appeared with greater frequency and intensity in recent years. Some scientists think that may be related to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which is one of the most visible consequences of manmade global warming. The 2012 sea ice melt season, which ended just one month ago, was extreme, with sea ice extent, volume, and other measures all hitting record lows. The loss of sea ice opens large expanses of open water, which then absorbs more of the incoming solar radiation and adds heat and moisture to the atmosphere, thereby helping to alter weather patterns. Exactly how weather patterns are changing as a result, however, is a subject of active research. Global warming is also expected to alter hurricane frequency and strength, making North Atlantic hurricanes slightly more powerful, while reducing the overall number of storms during the coming decades. Detecting such changes in the observational record is difficult, considering the varying ways people have kept tabs on hurricanes prior to the era of hurricane hunter aircraft flights. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that warmer sea surface temperatures are tied to an increase in stronger Atlantic hurricanes. Regardless of any changes in hurricane intensity, storms are already likely to produce more signiifcant coastal flooding, since sea levels have been rising during the past century, due to a combination of warming ocean waters and melting of polar ice caps. If Hurricane Sandy were to strike New York City in 2050, it would cause even more damage, since sea levels are expected to be considerably higher by midcentury.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Thursday, October 25, 2012 Storm Looking More Probable Hurricane Sandy slammed into Cuba during the night with 100+ mph winds. The storm is currently moving north. While the U.S. GFS model and its various versions continue to take the storm into the Atlantic, the other models bring the hurricane inland. The question is where. There is some clustering of the models into the DelMarVa area and the models that bring the storm's center into that region are all quite strong with winds of 70 mph or more. Think in terms of the June derecho and add coastal flooding, river flooding and a larger geographic area and you get an idea of how many problems this storm may cause. If you live in a coastal county from Norfolk to Boston (a landfall farther north would give you more time), it is time to get to work on preparations. Here is what I recommend: Get prescriptions refilled now, especially if you doctor must approve the refill. Vote. If the stronger models are correct, power could still be out in some paces on election day. Regardless, that is one less thing you will need to do. If you have considered getting a generator, now would be a good time to do it, but get started today so you have time to have an electrician do the installation. Generators should not be self-installed. If you don't have a generator, get a power inverter or two. Radio Shack and similar stores sell them. They are a "poor man's generator" and will keep your cell phone, laptop, and similar charged. Keep your car's gas tank full. If you have airline travel planned through this region Monday-Tuesday, it could well be disrupted. The problem is that the airlines have not yet issued waivers, so it is going to be tough to get them to switch your flight. Your best bet would be to get the airline to switch hubs. For example, assume you have a flight to London via NYC (Delta) or DC-IAD (United). Get them to switch you to connecting through Atlanta or Chicago, respectfully. But, until waivers are issued, this will likely involve an extra fee. Here is my Airline Crisis Survival Guide. Read it now. These are all low-cost preparations you can take now. I'd love to be wrong about the threat but, if I am, there is nothing here that is high cost or that you will not eventually use (gasoline and a prescription). By taking these precautions now, you will be well ahead if the worst occurs.

A man worries about the wind and rain, but another force of nature hits home. Ashley Murray became the first female president of Liberty Industrial Gases and Welding Supplies Inc. in Brooklyn. But now the family history Murray was charged with preserving is at risk of ending after Superstorm Sandy. The adage says "a picture is worth a thousand words," but when Leeann Lewandowski happened upon a photograph of her late mother on Facebook after her home was destroyed in Superstorm Sandy, she was speechless.
The MTA shut down its mass transit network - which moves about 7 million people an average weekday - Sunday night to protect trains and other equipment from being damaged, and to hasten a return to service. The potential for flooding prompted officials to close the Hugh Carey Tunnel (formerly the Brooklyn-Battery) linking lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the Holland Tunnel, connecting Manhattan and New Jersey. Bridges remained open but Gov. Cuomo said Monday morning they could be closed if wind gusts reached 60 mph. There were weather forecasts predicting gust of up to 90 mph, Cuomo said, urging everyone to stay off the roads. "Use common sense," Cuomo said. "You really don't need to be on the road." The subway system has dealt with flooding from intense rainfalls but officials were concerned Monday that salt water would enter East River tunnels in lower Manhattan from a surging sea and New York Harbor. Advertisement "We're very concerned about water surge in the Battery," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said at the press conference with Cuomo. "That's one of our lowest-lying areas. Our general ability to run the system and keep it safe is in jeopardy." Officials could not say when the system would be up and running, as the worst of the storm was expected to hit early Tuesday. The last hurricane or tropical story to wreak havoc - Irene - was costly. The MTA put the total tab at $110 million, including overtime, lost revenue from lost ridership, and equipment. Nearly half of that amount went to rebuilt a commuter rail line on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River in New York that the authority operates.

News Corp. noted that, with the company's global headquarters located in New York, the storm had an impact on the communities where many News Corp. employees live and work. “Our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones and those families coping with this tremendous natural disaster. But we are also heartened by the stories of communities pulling together, with neighbors helping neighbors through this difficult time,” News Corp. Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch said. “I sincerely hope many other companies will also be able to provide assistance to families and communities in need of help.” The storm has had a drastic impact on the entertainment industry, with numerous productions in New York, including the CBS drama "Person of Interest" and the upcoming Darren Aranofsky biblical epic "Noah," forced to shut down.

Read More Risk of Sandy-Level Flood in NYC Has Doubled Since 1950 By Andrew Freedman Published: September 5th, 2013 , Last Updated: September 5th, 2013 As the anniversary of Hurricane Sandy approaches, a new study points to the rapidly escalating risk of Sandy-magnitude flooding events in the New York City area. The study, published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, found that sea level rise has already nearly doubled the annual probability of a Sandy-level flood in the New York City region since 1950. Rising seas are a consequence of manmade global warming, as well as local shifts in land surface elevations. Sea level rise has accelerated in recent years, from a rate of 1.7 millimeters per year between 1901 to 2010, up to 3.2 millimeters per year between 1993 and 2010. Depending on how much sea levels increase by the end of the century, the study said Sandy-like flooding could occur once every few decades in Manhattan, and on the order of once a year in parts of New Jersey and coastal Connecticut. By raising the water level, sea level rise provides storms with a higher launching pad for storm surges, which are bulges of water caused by a storm's winds, forward motion, and atmospheric pressure, to ride on top of. As sea level rises it becomes possible for weaker storms, such as common nor’easters, to cause Sandy-magnitude flooding. That means that coastal communities may have to rethink their flood protection measures and long-term coastal development policies, as New York is already doing. Hurricane Sandy flooded each of the subway tunnels connecting Manhattan to Queens and Brooklyn, cut off power to lower Manhattan, and transformed coastal towns like Mantaloking, N.J., and Long Beach, N.Y. “Today’s coastal infrastructure . . . is steadily losing ground due to relative sea level rise,” said study co-author William Sweet, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, during a conference call with reporters. Because of the storm’s massive size and extremely unusual westward movement, Hurricane Sandy drove a massive storm surge into the northern Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coastlines, causing more than $60 billion in damage. The storm broke 16 records for the highest storm tide, including at The Battery in lower Manhattan. The storm tide combines both the storm surge and the tide level, and at many locations, Sandy's surge coincided with high tide. “Sandy’s rare onshore impact angle produced a massive storm surge” of about 2.7 meters, or about 9 feet, above high tide at The Battery on the southern tip of Manhattan, Sweet said. While a flood on the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy increases as sea level rises, it's still an exceedingly rare event. One can be expected to occur at The Battery every 1,570 years. That means that each year, New Yorkers face about a 0.064 percent chance of seeing a similar flood, according to Sweet. In 1950, when the sea level was lower, the return period for a Sandy-type flood was much longer at 2,330 years. The study projects a huge increase in the annual risk of Sandy-type flooding in areas hit hard by the storm. While the probability of a Sandy-level flood in New York City itself has risen by about 50 percent since 1950, in impacted areas outside the city including the New Jersey shoreline, the probability has more than tripled, Sweet said. If sea level rises significantly, but below worst-case scenarios, then at The Battery and in Sandy Hook, N.J., both of which set records during Sandy for the highest storm tide, Sandy-magnitude floods could become about 50- and 20-year events, respectively. Under the worst-case sea level rise scenario, though, that return period would decline to less than 2 years at each of these locations. In such a scenario, sea level would rise by 2 meters, or 6.6 feet, by 2100, which is a higher amount than what is called for in most sea level rise projections. Before (left) and after images of the amusement park at Seaside Heights, N.J., which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy.Click image to enlarge. Credit: NOAA. With 1.2 meters, or about 4 feet, of sea level rise by 2100, the study projects that Sandy-level flooding would occur at intervals of every few decades at The Battery and Sandy Hook, and annually at all other tide gauge stations studied, from Virginia northward to Newport, Rhode Island. “Coastal communities are facing a looming sea level rise crisis, one that will manifest itself as (an) increased frequency of Sandy-like inundation disasters in the coming decades along the Mid-Atlantic and elsewhere,” the study said. A forthcoming report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to project that global average sea level may rise by an average of up to 2 feet by 2100, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions and other factors. However, locally higher amounts of sea level rise are likely, and other studies have shown that the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast can expect particularly steep increases in sea level compared to other parts of the U.S. Melting ice sheets and mountain glaciers are now the dominant contributor to global sea level rise, but considerable uncertainties exist regarding how quickly the vast frozen expanses of Greenland and Antarctica may melt as temperatures continue to increase. Editor's Note: This story has been edited to indicate that the probability of a Sandy-level flooding event in New York City itself has increased by about 50 percent since 1950, while areas close to to the city have seen a much steeper increase in probability. It has also been edited to correct the figure for the annual risk of a Sandy-level flood in New York, expressed as a percentage, which is 0.064 percent, not 0.0064 percent as originally indicated.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Thursday, October 25, 2012 We Have a 'Winner'! Sandy Blamed on Global Warming Yesterday, I asked this question: Turns out I wasn't even close. It has already been blamed. From the Huffington Post: Politico asked on Wednesday if perhaps Hurricane Sandy would be "the next climate wake-up call" as climate change will cause storms to become increasingly intense. As for this storm, the potential timing with Election Day led ClimateSilence.org's Brad Johnson to remark, “Sandy is yet another reminder that the candidates should stop competing over who can poison the weather faster with increased oil, gas and coal production." 3 comments: Hurricane larger and stronger than any which have ever occurred before? Well, the prediction was that global warming would cause that. It's good that people are blaming Hurricane Sandy on global warming. Because it *IS* due to global warming. Technically, only the incremental difference in strength over a "regular" big hurricane is due to global warming, of course. Time to admit it. People are blaming global warming for our more frequent and stronger hurricanes... because global warming is the cause of our more frequent and stronger hurricanes. I don't know how one could go about determining whether or not any given storm is due to 'global warming'. But there are a few things I'm pretty darn sure of.One: Given the absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide, visible-wavelength photons pass through the atmosphere more-or-less unaffected by the atmosphere's CO2.Two: The energy carried by those visible-wavelength photons gets transferred to the ground, rocks, and whatever else they hit.Three: That transferred energy makes all those things heat up.Four: When things get hotter, they radiate energy, mostly in the IR portion of the spectrum.Five: Given the absorption spectrum of CO2, the energy carried by those IR-wavelength photons tends to get absorbed by atmospheric CO2.Six: As a result of the above, the more CO2 there is in the atmosphere, the more heat energy is trapped in the atmosphere.Seven: Ultimately, the global weather system is a heat engine, driven by the difference in temperature between the Earth's "day side" and "night side".Eight: The more CO2 there is in the atmosphere, the greater the difference in temperature between Earth's "day side" and "night side".Nine: Since Earth's weather system is a heat engine, greater difference in temperature between Earth's "day side" and "night side" means greater extremes of weather—stronger and more-extreme storms in greater quantity, etc etc etc.None of the above can tell us whether any one storm in specific is due to 'global warming', of course; if the Earth's weather system is a heat engine, it's a ferociously hypercomplexificationated one whose behavior is, at best, only partially understood. But if anybody wants to make the argument that it's just not possible for 'global warming' to result in storms like H. Sandy, well, they've got their work cut out for them. Something like, oh, demonstrating that we've got the absorption spectrum of hydrogen all wrong, that would do the trick…
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Friday, October 26, 2012 Airlines Finally Issue Waivers for Hurricane Sandy At last, the airlines have issued waivers for Hurricane Sandy. Here are American's. Now, you have a chance to proactively switch your plans and avoid this giant mess. My Airline Crisis Survival Guide (don't worry, it is free and a click away) shows you how. Don't even think about flying into the Northeast Monday through Wednesday. If you must travel, fly around it. For example, if you are scheduled to go on United to Germany via EWR, see if they will switch you to ORD. Good luck! UPDATE: Moments after posting the above, United told us Sandy "may" affect travel. They should have issued waivers yesterday, but I guess it is better they woke up now rather than later.
Hurricane Sandy expands overnight East Coast view of Hurricane Sandy, GOES Imagery from NOAA. October 27th 2012. Sandy has become so large that typical floater imagery doesn’t capture the entire storm. As of 11am eastern from the National Hurricane Center: Maximum sustained winds are near 75mph Minimum central pressure is near 958mb Sandy is moving North-Northeast at about 9mph. Sandy is doing a balancing act north of the Bahamas where it is trying to deepen (lower its central pressure) and expand its wind field at the same time. Fluctuations in its maximum wind speeds have been the result, and Sandy will likely continue to be at borderline hurricane status until Sunday night when it will try to strengthen as it gets energized by its merger with the trough over the interior Eastern United States. Hurricane Sandy’s pressure fell from 969mb at 11pm last night to 958mb at 11am this morning indicating deepening. While its maximum radius of tropical storm force winds expanded from 275miles at 5pm yesterday, to 450miles at 5am this morning. All Hurricane Warnings have been discontinued for now, but tropical storm conditions are still occurring in the northernmost Bahamas, offshore of Florida and North and South Carolina where tropical storm warnings are in effect. Further advisories, watches, and warnings will be needed as Sandy approaches, potentially from North Carolina to Maine. East coast states have already declared states of emergency and some evacuation notices have been posted in advance of Sandy’s landfall which is forecast to be somewhere in New Jersey or the Delmarva peninsula. Official National Hurricane Center track for Hurricane Sandy as of 11am Eastern Time. Tropical Storm Warnings for parts of North and South Carolina and the Bahamas in blue, and Tropical Storm Watches in yellow for parts of South Carolina and Bermuda. Impacts…Heavy flooding rain over 6″ in areas is likely near the storm’s path. Areas where both storm surge and flooding rains are a threat may have the flooding exacerbated by the unusually high tides down stream. Heavy wet snow is a distinct possibility in the higher elevations of Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Significant coastal flooding is also likely in areas of onshore winds and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where storm surges are forecast to reach up to 8feet and storm tides may be extreme due to the large changes between low and high tide and the astronomical high tide with the full moon on Monday. Damaging winds (30-60mph) could extend far inland causing tree damage and potentially some power outages. Structurally damaging winds (50-75mph) could occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland. Keep in mind that tropical storm force winds (sustained at >39mph) have been observed more than 400miles from the center of this storm – so even though the storm may make landfall in New Jersey, areas as far north as Maine and as far inland as Ontario and Quebec (including Lakes Erie and Ontario) could see tropical storm conditions. Areas to the south will have offshore winds, and tropical storm force winds will extend less far from the center and will be gustier in nature. In these areas, hazardously low water levels may be observed, especially at low tide. Meanwhile, there could be a period of tropical storm conditions in Bermuda (Tropical Storm Watch) sometime between tonight and Monday night as Sandy continues to expand and passes to the distant west. Squally showers will be the theme here during that period. Post navigation 12 thoughts on “Hurricane Sandy expands overnight” hi!,I love your writing very a lot!

Photos: Hurricane Irene Just Barely Missed NYC Five Years Ago Five years ago, Hurricane Irene made landfall in Coney Island at 8:45 a.m. on Sunday morning, August 28th, 2011. That weekend, New York York's state and city officials ordered hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes and shut down the subway system, as New Yorkers battened down the hatches, waiting for a storm of Biblical proportions that, luckily, never came. In retrospect, Irene gave us the first glimpse at the vulnerability of our city, built on the tradition of shipping and trading, to the water around us. The damage to the Rockaways, the reality check on the perils of climate change and the mass-transit-shutdown-induced paralysis played out in miniature what happened the following year with Superstorm Sandy.

Site Mobile Navigation Are Humans to Blame? Science Is Out The water rose at Battery Park. Scientists said they did not know for sure if Hurricane Sandy could be tied directly to climate change, a question on the minds of many along the storm’s path.Credit Marcus Yam for The New York Times From the darkened living rooms of Lower Manhattan to the wave-battered shores of Lake Michigan, the question is occurring to millions of people at once: Did the enormous scale and damage from Hurricane Sandy have anything to do with climate change? Hesitantly, climate scientists offered an answer this week that is likely to satisfy no one, themselves included. They simply do not know for sure if the storm was caused or made worse by human-induced global warming. They do know, however, that the resulting storm surge along the Atlantic coast was almost certainly intensified by decades of sea-level rise linked to human emissions of greenhouse gases. And they emphasized that Hurricane Sandy, whatever its causes, should be seen as a foretaste of trouble to come as the seas rise faster, the risks of climate change accumulate and the political system fails to respond. By the time Hurricane Sandy hit the Northeast coast on Monday, upending lives across the Eastern half of the country, it had become a freakish hybrid of a large, late-season hurricane and a winter storm more typical of the middle latitudes. Though by no means unprecedented, that type of hybrid storm is rare enough that scientists have not studied whether it is likely to become more common in a warming climate. “My profession hasn’t done its homework,” said Kerry A. Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I think there’s going to be a ton of papers that come out of this, but it’s going to take a couple of years.” Scientists note that a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which in principle supplies more energy for storms of all types. The statistics seem to show that certain types of weather extremes, notably heat waves and heavy downpours, are becoming more common. But how those general principles will influence hurricanes has long been a murky and contentious area of climate science. Most scientists expect that the number of Atlantic hurricanes will actually stay steady or decline in coming decades as the climate warms, but that the proportion of intense, damaging storms is likely to rise. The experts differ sharply on whether such a rise can already be detected in hurricane statistics. Recent decades seem to show an increase in hurricane strength, but hurricanes tend to rise and fall in a recurring cycle over time, so it is possible that natural variability accounts for the recent trends. Jeff Masters, a meteorologist and founder of a popular Web site, Weather Underground, suspects some kind of shift is under way. The number of hurricanes and tropical storms over the past three years has been higher than average, with 19 named storms in both 2010 and 2011 and 19 so far this hurricane season, which ends Nov. 30. According to the National Hurricane Center there are, on average, 12 named storms each season. “The climatology seems to have changed,” Dr. Masters said. “We’re getting these very strange, very large storms with very low central pressures that don’t have that much wind at the surface.” An error has occurred.

And several scientists pointed out this week that parts of the western Atlantic were remarkably warm for late October as Hurricane Sandy passed over, as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal for this time of year. Kevin E. Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said that natural variability probably accounted for most of that temperature extreme. But, he added, human-induced global warming has raised the overall temperature of the ocean surface by about one degree Fahrenheit since the 1970s. So global warming probably contributed a notable fraction of the energy on which the storm thrived — maybe as much as 10 percent, he said. Dr. Trenberth said that many of Sandy’s odd features, including its large scale, derived from its origin as a merger of two weather systems that converged in the western Atlantic. “My view is that a lot of this is chance,” he said. “A hybrid storm is certainly one which is always in the cards, and it’s one we’ve always worried about.” Winds knocked out power as far west as Michigan. But the most serious damage, including the flooding of New York’s subway tunnels and the broad destruction along the Jersey Shore, came as the storm pushed roiling ocean waters onto land, a phenomenon known as storm surge. The surge set records in some places, including the Battery in Lower Manhattan. Globally, the ocean rose about eight inches in the last century, and the rate seems to have accelerated to about a foot a century. Scientists say most of the rise is a direct consequence of human-induced climate change. Ocean water expands when it warms, accounting for some of the rise, and land ice is melting worldwide, dumping extra water into the ocean. Scientists say they believe the rate will accelerate further, so that the total increase by the end of this century could exceed three feet.

Sandy whipped torrents of water over the streets of Atlantic City, stretching for blocks inland and ripping up part of the vacation spot's fabled boardwalk. The storm surge set records in Lower Manhattan, where flooded substations caused a widespread power outage. It swamped beachfronts on both sides of Long Island Sound and delivered hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Cape Cod as it came ashore. Sandy's wrath also prompted the evacuation of about 200 patients at NYU Langone Medical Center. "We are having intermittent telephone access issues, and for this reason the receiving hospital will notify the families of their arrival," spokeswoman Lisa Greiner said. In addition, the basement of New York's Bellevue Hospital Center flooded, and the hospital was running off of emergency backup power. Ian Michaels of the Office of Emergency Management said the main priority is to help secure additional power and obtain additional fuel and pumps for the hospital. The storm hit near Atlantic City about 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center reported. It packed 80-mph winds at landfall, down from the 90 mph clocked earlier Monday. "I've been down here for about 16 years, and it's shocking what I'm looking at now. It's unbelievable," said Montgomery Dahm, owner of the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, which stayed open as Sandy neared the Jersey Shore. "I mean, there's cars that are just completely underwater in some of the places I would never believe that there would be water." Dahm's family cleared out of Atlantic City before the storm hit, but he says he stayed put to serve emergency personnel. At nightfall Monday, he said the water was lapping at the steps of his restaurant, where a generator was keeping the lights on. Sandy makes landfall Ray Kelly: We're concerned with flooding Sandy sends waves crashing in New York Blizzard conditions hit Appalachians The storm had already knocked down power lines and tree limbs while still 50 miles offshore and washed out a section of the boardwalk on the north end of town, Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford told CNN. He said there were still "too many people" who didn't heed instructions to evacuate, and he urged anyone still in town to "hunker down and try to wait this thing out." "When Mother Nature sends her wrath your way, we're at her mercy, and so all we can do is stay prayerful and do the best that we can," Langford said. And in Seaside Heights, about 30 miles north of Atlantic City, Police Chief Thomas Boyd told CNN, "The whole north side of my town is totally under water." In New York, lower Manhattan's Battery Park recorded nearly 14-foot tide, smashing a record set by 1960's Hurricane Donna by more than 3 feet. The city had already halted service on its bus and train lines, closing schools and ordering about 400,000 people out of their homes in low-lying areas of Manhattan and elsewhere. Flooding forced the closure of all three of the major airports in the area, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty. Water seeped into subway stations in Lower Manhattan and into the tunnel connecting Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, while high winds damaged a crane perched atop a Midtown skyscraper under construction, forcing authorities to evacuate the surrounding area. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters there was an "extraordinary" amount of water in Lower Manhattan, as well as downed trees throughout the city and widespread power outages. "We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations," he said. "The worst of the weather has come, and city certainly is feeling the impacts." The storm was blamed for more than 2.8 million outages across the Northeast. About 350,000 of them were in the New York city area, where utility provider Con Edison reported it had also cut power to customers in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan to protect underground equipment as the storm waters rose. But as water crept into its substations, Con Ed said it had lost service to about 250,000 customers in Manhattan -- including most of the island south of 39th Street. At least five people had been killed in storm-related incidents in New York state, including three killed by trees falling on homes in Queens and in the town of New Salem, near Albany, city and state officials said. Falling trees were also blamed for three deaths reported in New Jersey and one in Connecticut, authorities there told CNN. In West Virginia, a woman was killed in a car accident after the storm dumped 5 inches of snow on the town of Davis, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's office. Water washes over downtown Atlantic City Transformer explodes in lower Manhattan Waves lapping into New Jersey surf club Wall Street closes for Hurricane Sandy And before hitting land, it overwhelmed the sailing ship HMS Bounty, a replica of the historic British vessel, off North Carolina. Fourteen of the ship's crew of 16 were rescued, but the body of one deckhand was found Monday evening and the ship's captain was still missing Monday night, the Coast Guard said. Sandy had already claimed at least 67 lives in the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. Sandy's storm surges were boosted by a full moon, which already brings the highest tides of the month. And forecasters said the storm was likely to collide with a cold front and spawn a superstorm that could generate flash floods and snowstorms. "It could be bad," said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Rattior, "or it could be devastation." Mass transit shut down across the densely populated Northeast, landmarks stood empty and schools and government offices were closed. The National Grid, which provides power to millions of customers, said 60 million people could be affected before it's over. On Fire Island, off Long Island, the water rose above promenades and docks on Monday afternoon, homeowner Karen Boss said. Boss stayed on the island with her husband despite a mandatory evacuation order. She said they own several properties and a business there and had weathered previous storms. "I'm concerned that it might come into the first floor," she said. "If that's the case, I'll just move into another house that's higher up." Based on pressure readings, it's likely to be the strongest storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The benchmark storm, the 1938 "Long Island Express" Hurricane, contained a low pressure reading of 946 millibars; Sandy had a minimum pressure of 943 millibars. Generally speaking, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro scrawled a plea on the plywood that covered her burger restaurant: "Be kind to us Sandy." The seaside area largely dodged last year's Hurricane Irene, but Cafaro was not optimistic that Sea Bright would be spared Sandy. Its arrival, eight days before the U.S. presidential election, forced President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, to alter or cancel several campaign stops. Obama flew back to Washington from Florida, telling reporters at the White House that assets were in place for an effective response to the storm. "The most important message I have for the public right now is please listen to what your state and local officials are saying," Obama said. "When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate." And in Ohio, Romney asked supporters to drop off items and cash at his "victory centers" to be donated to victims of the storm. "There are families in harm's way that will be hurt -- either in their possessions or perhaps in something more severe," Romney said. By Monday afternoon, 23 states were under a warning or advisory for wind related to Sandy. Thousands of flights had been canceled, and hundreds of roads and highways were expected to flood. And according to a government model, Sandy's wind damage alone could cause more than $7 billion in economic loss. Sandy was expected to weaken once it moves inland, but the center was expected to move slowly northward, meaning gusty winds and heavy rain would continue through Wednesday. On the western side of the storm, the mountains of West Virginia expected up to 3 feet of snow and the mountains of southwestern Virginia to the Kentucky state line could see up to 2 feet. Twelve to 18 inches of snow were expected in the mountains near the North Carolina-Tennessee border. "This is not a typical storm," said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett. "Essentially, this is a hurricane wrapped in a 'nor'easter.'" A mother learns that her newborn is part of a hospital evacuation. Facebook posts from a member of the HMS Bounty turn ominous.

New York Is Lagging as Seas and Risks Rise, Critics Warn Sea walls, marshes and trees in Brooklyn Bridge Park, part of efforts by New York City agencies to cope with rising seas.Credit Michael Kamber for The New York Times With a 520-mile-long coast lined largely by teeming roads and fragile infrastructure, New York City is gingerly facing up to the intertwined threats posed by rising seas and ever-more-severe storm flooding. So far, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has commissioned exhaustive research on the challenge of climate change . His administration is expanding wetlands to accommodate surging tides, installing green roofs to absorb rainwater and prodding property owners to move boilers out of flood-prone basements. But even as city officials earn high marks for environmental awareness, critics say New York is moving too slowly to address the potential for flooding that could paralyze transportation, cripple the low-lying financial district and temporarily drive hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Only a year ago, they point out, the city shut down the subway system and ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people as Hurricane Irene barreled up the Atlantic coast. Ultimately, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and spared the city, but it exposed how New York is years away from — and billions of dollars short of — armoring itself. Instead of “planning to be flooded,” as he put it, city, state and federal agencies should be investing in protection like sea gates that could close during a storm and block a surge from Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean into the East River and New York Harbor. Others express concern for areas like the South Bronx and Sunset Park in Brooklyn , which have large industrial waterfronts with chemical-manufacturing plants, oil-storage sites and garbage-transfer stations. Unless hazardous materials are safeguarded with storm surges in mind, some local groups warn, residents could one day be wading through toxic water. “A lot of attention is devoted to Lower Manhattan , but you forget that you have real industries on the waterfront” elsewhere in the city, said Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, which represents low-income residents of industrial areas. “We’re behind in consciousness-building and disaster planning.” Other cities are also tackling these issues, at their own pace. New shoreline development around San Francisco Bay must now be designed to cope with the anticipated higher sea levels under new regional regulations imposed last fall. In Chicago , new bike lanes and parking spaces are made of permeable pavement that allows rainwater to filter through it. Charlotte , N.C., and Cedar Falls, Iowa , are restricting development in flood plains. Maryland is pressing shoreline property owners to plant marshland instead of building retaining walls. Officials in New York caution that adapting a city of eight million people to climate change is infinitely more complicated and that the costs must be weighed against the relative risks of flooding. The last time a hurricane made landfall directly in New York City was more than a century ago. Many decisions also require federal assistance, like updated flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that incorporate sea level rise, and agreement from dozens of public agencies and private partners that own transportation, energy, telecommunications and other infrastructure. “It’s a million small changes that need to happen,” said Adam Freed, until August the deputy director of the city’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability. “Everything you do has to be a calculation of the risks and benefits and costs you face.” And in any case, Mr. Freed said, “you can’t make a climate-proof city.” So city officials are pursuing a so-called resilience strategy that calls for strengthening the city’s ability to weather the effects of serious flooding and recover from it. Flooding Threat Grows Unlike New Orleans , New York City is above sea level. Yet the city is second only to New Orleans in the number of people living less than four feet above high tide — nearly 200,000 New Yorkers, according to the research group Climate Central.

Low-lying areas of New York City are vulnerable to storms.Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times The waters on the city’s doorstep have been rising roughly an inch a decade over the last century as oceans have warmed and expanded. But according to scientists advising the city, that rate is accelerating, because of environmental factors, and levels could rise two feet higher than today’s by midcentury. More frequent flooding is expected to become an uncomfortable reality. With higher seas, a common storm could prove as damaging as the rare big storm or hurricane is today, scientists say. Were sea levels to rise four feet by the 2080s, for example, 34 percent of the city’s streets could lie in the flood-risk zone, compared with just 11 percent now, a 2011 study commissioned by the state said. New York has added bike lanes, required large buildings to track and reduce their energy use, banned the dirtiest home heating oils, and taken other steps to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming. But with shoreline development that ranges from public beaches to towering high rises — and a complex mix of rivers, estuaries, bays and ocean — the city needs to size up the various risks posed by rising seas before plunging ahead with vast capital projects or strict regulations, city officials argue. Yet the city’s plan for waterfront development dismisses any notion of retreat from the shoreline. Curbing development or buying up property in flood plains, as some smaller cities have done, is too impractical here, city officials say, especially because the city anticipates another million residents over the next two decades. Rather, the city and its partners are incorporating flood-protection measures into projects as they go along. Consolidated Edison , the utility that supplies electricity to most of the city, estimates that adaptations like installing submersible switches and moving high-voltage transformers above ground level would cost at least $250 million. Lacking the means, it is making gradual adjustments, with about $24 million spent in flood zones since 2007. Some steps taken by city agencies have already subtly altered the city’s looks. At Brooklyn Bridge Park, a buffer between the East River and neighborhoods like Dumbo, porous riprap rock and a soft edge of salt-resistant grass have been laid in to help absorb the punch of a storm surge. Sidewalk bioswales, or vegetative tree pits that can fill up with rainwater to reduce storm water and sewage overflows and also minimize flooding, are popping up around the city. Over all, the city is hoping to funnel more than $2 billion of public and private money to such environmental projects over the next 18 years, officials say. An error has occurred.

You are already subscribed to this email. “It’s a series of small interventions that cumulatively, over time, will take us to a more natural system” to deal with climate change, said Carter H. Strickland, the city’s environmental commissioner. Planning experts say it is hard to muster public support for projects with uncertain or distant benefits. “There’s a lot of concern about angering developers,” said Ben Chou, a water-policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council . New York planners have proposed requiring developers to assess the climate-change risks faced by new buildings so they can consider protection like retractable watertight gates for windows. But no such requirements have been imposed so far. While some new buildings are being elevated or going above current required flood protections — like a new recycling plant on a Brooklyn pier and the Port Authority’s transit hub at the World Trade Center site — most new construction is not being adapted to future flood risks yet, industry representatives said. Some experts argue that the encounter with Hurricane Irene last year and a flash flood in 2007 underscored the dangers of deferring aggressive solutions.

Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, said the storm surge from Irene came, on average, just one foot short of paralyzing transportation into and out of Manhattan. If the surge had been just that much higher, subway tunnels would have flooded, segments of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and roads along the Hudson River would have turned into rivers, and sections of the commuter rail system would have been impassable or bereft of power, he said. The most vulnerable systems, like the subway tunnels under the Harlem and East Rivers, would have been unusable for nearly a month, or longer, at an economic loss of about $55 billion, said Dr. Jacob, an adviser to the city on climate change and an author of the 2011 state study that laid out the flooding prospects. “We’ve been extremely lucky,” he said. “I’m disappointed that the political process hasn’t recognized that we’re playing Russian roulette.” With more rain and higher seas, some envision more turmoil — like mile after mile of apartment buildings without working elevators, lights or potable water. “That’s a key vulnerability,” said Rafael Pelli, a Manhattan architect who serves on a climate-change committee that advises the Department of City Planning. “If you have to relocate 10,000 people, how do you do that?” Barriers to Block Tides Some New Yorkers argue that the answer lies not in evacuation, but in prevention, like armoring city waterways with the latest high-tech barriers. Others are not so sure. At a recent meeting of Manhattan community board leaders in Harlem, Robert Trentlyon, a resident of Chelsea, argued for sea gates. A 2004 study by Mr. Hill and the Storm Surge Research Group at Stony Brook recommended installing movable barriers at the upper end of the East River, near the Throgs Neck Bridge; under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge; and at the mouth of the Arthur Kill, between Staten Island and New Jersey . During hurricanes and northeasters, closing the barriers would block a huge tide from flooding Manhattan and parts of the Bronx , Brooklyn, Queens , Staten Island and New Jersey, they said. City officials say that sea barriers are among the options being studied, but others say such gates could interfere with aquatic ecosystems and with the flushing out of pollutants, and may eventually fail as sea levels keep rising. And then there is the cost. Installing barriers for New York could reach nearly $10 billion. There is more agreement on how to protect the subway system. Several studies have advised the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to move quickly to increase pumping capacity at stations, raise entrances and design floodgates to block water from entering. In 2009, a commission warned that global warming posed “a new and potentially dire challenge for which the M.T.A. system is largely unprepared.” Five years ago, a summer-morning deluge brought about 3 1/2 inches of rain in two hours and paralyzed the system for hours, stranding 2.5 million riders. That prompted the transit agency to spend $34 million on improvements like raising some ventilation grates nine inches above sidewalks and building steps that head upward, before descending, at flood-prone stations. All the money came from the agency’s capital budget, which also pays for subway cars and buses. “This is a vicious circle of the worst kind,” Projjal Dutta, the transportation agency’s director of sustainability, said of the financial effect. “You’re cutting public transportation, which cuts down greenhouse gases, to harden against climate change.” A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2012, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: New York Is Lagging as Seas And Risks Rise, Critics Warn.

The name may be funny—Frankenstorm—but be advised: Hurricane Sandy is no joke. Over the weekend meteorologists were running out of frightening things to say about Sandy, which by the time it makes landfall on Monday evening—most likely in New Jersey—will almost certainly be the largest storm to ever hit the East Coast, with a reach that extends some 450 miles beyond its core. Sandy truly will be the perfect storm—not just because a hurricane is meeting a northern blockage that will fuel its strength as it hits land as well as another western storm system, but because Sandy is set to strike the richest and most populated part of the U.S. “We’re looking at impact of greater than 50 to 60 million people,” said Louis Uccellini, head of environmental prediction for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A drone strike couldn’t be better targeted to cause maximum damage than this storm. A NOAA video shows what’s happening as Sandy collides with the other fronts (h/t Andy Revkin): It’s not so much that Sandy is an incredibly strong storm, with winds at about 85 mph. NOAA’s Hurricane Research Division put the destructive power of Sandy’s winds at a modest 2.6 on a scale of 0 to 6. The real danger comes from the potentially huge storm surges the hurricane could cause along coastal areas. NOAA put the storm surge threat from Sandy at 5.7 on that 6 point scale—greater than any hurricane observed between 1969 and 2005, including Category 5 storms like Katrina and Andrew. NOAA’s National Hurricane Center says that “life-threatening storm surge flooding” is expected along the mid-Atlantic coast. For coastal cities, such surges—amplified by the fact that Sandy will be hitting during high tide—could prove disastrous. Storm surges are expected to reach 4 to 8 ft., if not higher, as Sandy pushes vast amounts of ocean water onto the land. In and around New York City, it could be worse, with storm surges predicted to reach as high as 11 ft.—nearly a record—in northern New Jersey and Long Island Sound. Preliminary forecasts suggest that lower Manhattan could experience its highest waters since at least 1851. That’s why Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Sunday morning that the city would evacuate low-lying areas, meaning that some 370,000 people—a population equal to that of Minneapolis—may need to move. The city also shut down its subway, bus and commuter rail services, beginning at 7 PM on Sunday. (Buses were shut down two hours later.) That decision—also taken when Irene neared New York last year—was made to try to reduce the risk of damage to subway equipment in tunnels, which could flood depending on the extent of the surge. “I give a 50% chance that Sandy’s storm surge will end up flooding a portion of New York’s subway system,” wrote Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground’s Wunderblog. It’s not clear when New York’s subway service will be restored, but if the flooding is severe, it might be a long, long time. New York just barely avoided disaster during Irene in 2011—Klaus Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, noted last year that if the storm surge had been just 1 ft. higher, subway tunnels under the Harlem and East River would have been unusable for a month, at an economic cost of $55 billion. The threat to the subways is another reminder that the economic cost of a storm has as much to do with where it hits as it does with how strong the hurricane is in the first place. And make no mistake: Sandy is a freak. While it’s not unheard of for hurricanes to form this late in the year—the actual Atlantic hurricane season extends another month—storms will usually be pulled out to sea by a semi-permanent low-pressure system near Iceland. But that’s not what happened with Sandy, as meterologist Eric Holthaus points out: The coincidence of that strong of a high pressure “block” being in place just when a hurricane is passing by — in and of itself a very rare occurrence — is just mind bogglingly rare. It’s the kind of stuff that’s important enough to rewrite meteorological textbooks. The result: Instead of heading out to sea Sandy’s full force will be turned back against the grain and directed squarely at the East Coast. The sheer oddness of Sandy’s arrival begs the obvious question: Is climate change involved here? Many environmentalists certainly think so. But scientists are always reluctant to link climate change to any specific weather event, and the impact of warming on hurricanes have proved particularly difficult to untangle. The last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report noted that scientists have “low confidence” in long-term increases in tropical cyclone activity due to man-made warming. It’s true that warming does increase the amount of moisture in the air, which can make storms rainier—just as we saw with Irene last year, and potentially with Sandy now. But don’t be fooled by cautious scientists—we can expect that global warming will likely bring about stronger and potentially more destructive storms and other natural disasters like Sandy. What we know is that, climate change or not, big storms will happen—and if they hit populated areas, they will cause damage. The immediate challenge is to prepare for those disasters, and in the future, build societies and infrastructure that can be resilient to the sort of catastrophes that we know will continue to unfold in the future. Sandy killed at least 61 people as it made its way through the Carribbean—53 of them in the desperately poor country of Haiti, which remains consistently unprepared for natural disasters. Sandy will almost certainly cause billions of dollars of damage when it hits the East Coast. We’re unlikely to see a severe death toll, thanks to the fact that rich societies like the U.S. have gotten better at predicting and preparing for storms. (The famous 1938 Long Island Express hurricane, another historic storm, killed some 800 people in the U.S.—a death toll that would be impossible to imagine today.) As Sandy looms, let’s hope we’re ready.
How -- and why -- Superstorm Sandy hit Northeast Ohio: Looking back 4 years later CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Four years ago a one-time hurricane named Sandy killed more than 100 people and caused more than $70 billion in damage in the United States alone. Sandy, later dubbed a superstorm, battered Jamaica, all the way to Michigan. Here in Cuyahoga county, damage was estimated at a whopping $17 million due to damaged facilities, power lines, and debris clean up. The highest wind gusts, according to the National Weather Service, were 68 mph at Cleveland-Hopkins, 67 mph at Burke-Lakefront Airport, and 48 mph at Akron/Canton Regional Airport. So why was the destruction so severe, especially so far from the Atlantic coast? Meteorologist Kelly Reardon breaks down the storm. How did a hurricane hit Northeast Ohio? To be fair, Sandy was no longer a hurricane or even a tropical storm when it swept through Northeast Ohio, causing days of power outages, closing schools and even postponing trick-or-treating. Northeast Ohio got hit with such intense thunderstorms and wind damage because a cold front collided with the remnants of Sandy, making the storm even fiercer. Cold fronts cause storms systems of their own, because they cause rising motion -- the first, most important ingredient in thunderstorm formation. Sandy provided extreme amounts of moisture to support heavy thunderstorms along this front which is what lead to the strong winds from downdrafts, down-bursts, and gust fronts. The blustering winds led to dangerous waves on Lake Erie, some reaching 20 feet, which forced the Ohio Department of Transportation to close all lanes of the East Shoreway between East 72nd and East 55th streets. Winds from Hurricane Sandy push water from Lake Erie over banks at the E. 55th street marina, spilling to the shoreway, Tuesday, October 30, 2012.Marvin Fong, The Plain Dealer The storm claimed the lives of over 100 people in the United States, 54 in Haiti, 11 in Cuba, 3 in the Dominican Republic, 2 in the Bahamas, 2 mariners, 2 in Jamaica, and 1 in Canada and Puerto Rico as it dominated the Atlantic Oct. 22-29. Once Sandy made landfall in New Jersey on Oct. 29 at 7:30 p.m. as an extra tropical cyclone (low pressure weakened to less than a tropical storm), widespread preparations and damage ensued. Here's what Sandy did: A declaration of state of emergency in New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Washington D.C., Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Amtrak canceled numerous routes to the coast. Nearly 14,000 canceled flights for over a week. New York Stock Exchange closed. United Nations headquarters in Manhattan closed. 7.9 million businesses and households without power in 15 states and Washington D.C. A storm surge created some of the most devastating impacts, including flooding in New York City's subway tunnels, water over-topping runways at La Guardia and Kennedy airports, and damage to the New Jersey Transit System estimated at approximately $400 million, according to NOAA. Inundation (flooding/storm surge) analysis.FEMA Even though Sandy made landfall as a post-tropical cyclone, it approached as a category 2 hurricane, with strong winds extending over 175 miles. This is when the most damage was inflicted. Once over New Jersey, the cyclone pushed west across New York before tracking northwest directly toward Northeast Ohio. Here, hundreds of trees and power lines were ripped down due to high winds, leaving over 300,000 Ohioans without power for days. This giant tree on Beachcliff Boulevard in Rocky River was one of hundreds felled by superstorm Sandy last October.Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com In Bay Village, wind speed readings reached over 60 mph, knocking down an estimated 500 trees. Lakewood's downed tree count was around 100, and city damage was estimated around $250,000, later reimbursed by FEMA, because of 36 continuous hours of 50 mph winds. A tree destroyed a 2007 Camry owned by Trevor Niskala, 30, on Leedale Avenue in Lakewood on Tuesday, October, 30, 2012. Neighbors said they heard the tree fall around 2:15 a.m. High winds from Hurricane Sandy played havoc on trees near Lake Erie in Lakewood.Lisa DeJong, The Plain Dealer But Hurricane Sandy definitely didn't only impact the United States -- check out Sandy's day-to-day movement from day 1 as a tropical storm to the last day of the hurricane's path. Day-by-day summary Oct. 23: Sandy intensified to category 1 hurricane strength on Oct. 23 just before reaching Jamaica, and a major hurricane (category 3 or above) just before hitting eastern Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center. Jamaica was hit with heavy rainfall and 80 mph winds, while Cuba saw 115 mph winds. Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.National Hurricane Center Oct. 25: Sandy then hit Haiti still as a category 2 hurricane. Oct 26: Once it hit the Bahamas, forecasters were seeing promising weakening, to a category 1 then to just a tropical storm, and thought there were only a few days left in the storm's life span as it continued north. Oct. 27: However, once the storm drifted northeast off the coast of the Carolinas and encountered warmer waters, more moisture, and increased atmospheric instability, it strengthened once again to a category 1 and then took a very rare turn to the northwest. Hurricane Sandy track.National Hurricane Center You can see how most hurricanes tend to move northeastward, and stick to that path, once near the east coast: Hurricane history map. Most hurricanes take a northeast turn off the east coast of the U.S., and Sandy took a very rare northwest turn.National Hurricane Center On that same day, Governor Chris Christie ordered mass evacuations in New Jersey for coastal areas and barrier islands. New York City suspended all of their subway line activity as Sandy approached the United States as a category 2 hurricane.

Even the combined $276m will require a scaling back of the city’s grand plans to flood-proof lower Manhattan. Photograph: NYC.gov New York City is getting a $176m funding injection from the federal government to help shield lower Manhattan from hurricanes and floods. “First, we get $176m to protect the shoreline and prevent devastation, God forbid another Sandy rolls in,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, who represents Manhattan. Hurricane Sandy was the worst natural disaster to ever hit New York City, killing 44 people in 2012 and costing $19bn. The new funding comes from a $1bn national contest hosted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help places affected by presidentially declared major disasters between 2011 and 2013. Cities and states applied to win funding, but because Hurricane Sandy had such a significant national and international impact, $181m was set aside specifically to deal with it. New York gets $176m of this pot. Downtown Manhattan was plunged into darkness for days due to power outages following Sandy. Telecommunications and sewerage systems were flooded and ruined. The skyline of lower Manhattan in darkness in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy. Photograph: Eduardo Munoz/Reuters Much of the city’s subway system connects through lower Manhattan, which suffered severe flooding. The area is also the home of Wall Street, major publishers and the headquarters of other global businesses. The flooding protection plan submitted to HUD covers the shoreline from Montgomery Street on the Lower East Side to the top of Battery Park City. (A separate plan using $335m of federal funds will cover the shoreline from Montgomery Street to East 23rd Street.) It includes improving storm water management – partially through building new parks, increasing access to the water, improving sewerage systems and reinforcing transportation options. “Second, as we build these protections, we will be able to greatly improve the recreational options on the Lower East Side, such as ball fields and bike paths, which are very much needed,” said Schumer. But the $176m is significantly less than the $500m requested in the city’s plan. Last August, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced $100m in city funding to support the lower Manhattan flood plan. “With the risks of climate change only growing, the city continues to act,” said mayoral spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. But even the combined $276m will require a scaling back of the city’s grand plans to flood-proof lower Manhattan and increase public access to the water. “There’s not as much money as originally envisioned. You have to replan, which is frustrating,” said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president. Brewer toured lower Manhattan shortly after the hurricane in October 2012. “There was just water everywhere. Floating cars. I couldn’t believe how far inland the water went,” she said. HUD declined to comment to the Guardian about the other winners of the funding, who are expected to be announced shortly.

Read More Sandy’s Storm Surge Explained and Why It Matters As Hurricane Sandy comes ashore and grinds its way inland, the hurricane’s storm surge — the pulse of seawater pushed ashore by Sandy’s winds and low atmospheric pressure — will almost certainly cause more concentrated damage than the hurricane’s powerful surface winds, torrential rains and mountain snows. Those other factors will be bad enough, especially since Sandy’s landfall in New Jersey — the nation’s most densely populated state, located smack in the middle of its most densely populated region — puts at least 60 million people, and probably more, at risk. Flash floods, falling trees, hurricane-force winds and power outages could cause billions of dollars in damage, and kill or injure people, from the Carolinas to Maine, and even into Canada. A single cubic yard of water, however, weighs nearly a ton — and when you add up the untold billions of cubic yards’ worth of ocean moving inexorably onto land in a pulse that could last a day or more, the crushing force involved is nearly impossible to imagine. Flooding along a thousand miles or more of coast could be nothing less than catastrophic. The threat to New York City alone is huge, as Climate Central’s Andrew Freedman has reported: “. . . is particularly dire, since storm surge models are projecting that the surge will be considerably larger than during Hurricane Irene in 2011, when there was only minor coastal flooding. The city’s subway tunnels are extremely vulnerable to coastal flooding, and a disaster was averted by mere inches during Irene, making it more likely that flooding will occur in some sections of the system this time, particularly in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. If the tunnels do flood, as suggested by the storm surge forecasts, it could cripple the lifeblood of transportation in and around the city for an extended period.” This nightmare scenario — for New York and the rest of the northeast — is especially likely because Sandy’s storm surge is peaking through three high tides, which magnifies its effect. At the moment, high tide itself is higher than normal because we’re right at the full moon, when tidal effects are at a maximum. As a result, according to National Weather Service projections and an analysis by Climate Central, it is likely that The Battery in Lower Manhattan, Sandy Hook, N.J., and Atlantic City will see the highest storm tides on record during Monday evening’s high tide. Those records go back to 1893, 1932, and 1911, respectively. At The Battery, the prior record occurred during Hurricane Donna in 1960. As of noon ET, the central estimate for The Battery was slightly more than 6 feet above the Mean High Water level (mean high tide), which would top the storm surge from Hurricane Irene by more than a foot. For Sandy Hook, Hurricane Sandy could top Irene's surge by 1-to-2 feet. In Bridgeport, Conn., the central estimate for surge is about 7.5 feet, which corresponds to a storm tide more than 5 feet above mean high tide. In Philadelphia, the surge may peak at 1 foot, but the tide could reach more than 2 feet above average. In Atlantic City, the surge may peak at 5.5 feet, reaching about 5 feet above mean high tide. And so on. (To figure out the particular risks for your local area, visit Climate Central’s interactive map.) As for the surge itself, even that is more complicated than just the wall-of-water metaphor that’s so tempting to use. As explained more fully by Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters, it’s more of a bulge of water, spread out over a wide area in front of the storm. Winds account for about 85 percent of the height of the average surge, and the tremendous wind field surrounding Hurricane Sandy is maximizing that component of storm surge. Another 5-to-10 percent comes from what’s called “wave set-up”— the fact that water can’t drain back off into the ocean because there’s more water pushing from behind. The final 5-to-10 percent comes from a tropical storm’s low atmospheric pressure, which literally sucks the ocean skyward. But even that isn’t the whole story. Global sea level is now about 8 inches higher, on average, than it was in 1900, in connection with global warming. Sinking land has added several inches more of local sea level rise in the Mid-Atlantic. That means the storm tides from Sandy are that much higher than they would have been if the identical storm had come along back then. And as sea level continues to rise in a warming world, a Sandy that arrives in 2100, when average sea level is likely to be about 3 feet higher than it is today, would be correspondingly more destructive.
Story Highlights What do you get when you mix a huge hurricane with another big storm, add a full moon, and sprinkle in Halloween? Frankenstorm! The name came, unexpectedly, from James Cisco, a forecaster with the typically staid federal government's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (now there's a catchy name!) in College Park, Md. Cisco first used the name Thursday afternoon in an online report: The winds from Sandy, he wrote, will be "incorporated into a hybrid vortex over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast next Tuesday." This "unusual merger…should settle back toward the interior Northeast through Halloween, inviting perhaps a ghoulish nickname for the cyclone along the lines of 'Frankenstorm,' an allusion to Mary Shelley's Gothic creature of synthesized elements." And where did the name Sandy come from? Well, Sandy is the "S" storm in the regular rotation of Atlantic hurricane names, selected years ago by the World Meteorological Organization. If it does the damage that's predicted, this name will certainly be retired, as are the names of all major, destructive hurricanes. Frankenstorm, however, will now likely go into the popular lexicon as did previous monster storms Snowmageddon, Snowpocalypse and Snowtober. More people have mentioned Sandy than Frankenstorm on Twitter, according to Sara Babiarz, Gannett's social media analyst. However, she says that Frankenstorm mentions have seen a big spike since 7:00 a.m. today. Despite its popularity, though, Frankenstorm is in no way an official name, reports James Franklin, branch chief of the National Hurricane Center. Sandy is the official name, and it always will be, he says, in all bulletins from the center. This will be the case even once Sandy moves ashore and is no longer a hurricane: At that time, Franklin says, it will be referred to as "Post-tropical Cyclone Sandy."
At least 43 people were killed: 40 in the Caribbean and three in the Bahamas. On October 25, Sandy got weaker and became a Category 1 hurricane. On October 27, Sandy became a tropical storm for a few hours. It then became a Category 1 hurricane again that morning. On October 26, Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray declared a state of emergency for the nation's capital. That same day the governors of Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia also declared a state of emergency. Landfall in New Jersey came on October 29. Damage was extensive there and in New York. It was the 2nd costliest hurricane behind Hurricane Katrina (2005). When the tropical depression formed, it was in an area of weak steering currents. This was located south of a ridge extending eastward from the Gulf of Mexico.[11] The system was in an area favorable for strengthening. Late on October 22, a Hurricane Hunters flight found winds of 40 mph (64 km/h) in a rainband. This made NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Sandy.[12] Because of the moistatmosphere, the storm got better organized.[13] Early on October 24, an eye began to develop.[14] By that time, Sandy was moving slowly northward. At 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC) on October 24, the NHC upgraded Sandy to hurricane status. This was because the Hurricane Hunters found winds of 99 mph (159 km/h). At the time, Sandy was located about 65 mi (105 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica.[15] Satellite image of Hurricane Sandy near Jamaica landfall Sandy made landfall near Kingston at 3:00 p.m EDT (1900 UTC) on October 24.[16] It had winds of about 80 mph (130 km/h). Before making its second landfall, Sandy got stronger and became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale with 110 mph (175 km/h). At 1:25 am EDT (0525 UTC), Sandy made landfall in Cuba just west of Santiago de Cuba.[17] When it made landfall in Cuba, Sandy had a visible eye of over 23 mi (37 km) in diameter. At the time, winds reached 135 mph (216 km/h).[18] While over land, the storm weakened and the eye was no longer visible.[19] After Sandy left Cuba, dry air and increasing shear caused the storm to be disorganized.[20] A mid-level low over Florida turned the hurricane toward the north-northwest.[21] By early on October 26, most of the storm was to the north of the center. This caused the storm to get larger.[22] By the next day, the NHC reported that Sandy was starting to become more of a hybrid cyclone.[23] On October 27, Sandy weakened to a tropical storm.[24] A few hours later, it got stronger and became a Category 1 hurricane again.[25] After Sandy developed into a tropical cyclone on October 22, the Government of Jamaica issued a tropical storm watch.[26] Early on October 23, the watch became a tropical storm warning.[27] That same day, a hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica. On that same day at 1500 UTC, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning.[28] Government weather forecasters said there is a 90% chance that the East Coast of the United States get "slammed".[36] Utilities and governments along the East Coast prepared for long-term power failures. In New Jersey, where the storm was expected to come ashore, utilities told employees to be prepared for longer shifts.[37] The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued its first statement of Sandy on October 25.[48] One model suggested that Sandy would make a landfall in the East Coast of the United States, possibly affecting Southern Ontario.[49][50] At least 253 people were confirmed killed across the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and the Bahamas, as a result of the storm.[51][54][62][67][68] The New York City Subway was shut down for days, and parts of it for months. Large areas lost electric power distribution for days. Thousands of houses were damaged by wind and flood, and hundreds burned because firefighters could not reach them.

As New York, New Jersey and the rest of the northeastern U.S. come to grips with Hurricane Sandy's impact, some leaders there are realizing that two debilitating hurricanes in as many years there are a sign that infrastructure there needs rethought, not just rebuilt.Postmortem assessments of Sandy's impact should include a "fundamental rethinking of our built environment," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday during a press conference.

Credit: Christine Gorman/Scientific American Evolutionary psychologists tell us it's human nature to search for lessons from the skies. Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, made a comment the other day that really captured the essence of the monster hybrid storm, Hurricane Sandy: "This thing is stitched together from elements (both) natural and unnatural." Most elements of this storm have indeed been observed in the past without any need for invoking global climate change as a causative agent. I've been trying to come up with something to say about Sandy that hasn't already been asserted and questioned and reasserted and so on. So I thought I'd talk about how nuclear plants weathered the storm. Bellevue The nation’s oldest public hospital—and the premier emergency institution in New York City—is the go-to place in the aftermath of a plane or train wreck, an all-out gunfight or a commercial airliner slicing through a skyscraper. If you’ve followed the U.S. news and weather in the past 24 hours you have no doubt run across a journalist or blogger explaining why it’s difficult to say that climate change could be causing big storms like Sandy.

During an eerily foreshadowing talk I attended the week before Sandy came crashing ashore, New York City’s climate resilience advisor, Leah Cohen, assured the small attending audience that PlaNYC 2030, a tentative map for the city’s sustainable growth, outlined no such plans to “buy back” developed areas in the city—even those dangerously close to the water’s edge.

[image-62]Hurricane Sandy came ashore in northern New Jersey Oct. 29, 2012, and as the powerful storm made its way along the East Coast it brought damage to NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Va. The Wallops Shoreline Protection Project has been managing the restoration efforts and released before and after photos of the shoreline. At 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 29, 2012, the National Hurricane Center reported tropical-storm-force winds were occurring along the coasts of southern New Jersey, Delaware and eastern Virginia. Tropical-storm-force winds extended as far inland as the central and southern Chesapeake Bay as Hurricane Sandy closed in for landfall. Hurricane Sandy removed about 700 feet of protective berm and about 20 percent of the beach protecting Wallops Island, home to NASA Wallops' launch pads and launch support facilities. The scenes of devastation and wreckage that Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Katrina (2005) left behind were tragically similar. Both storms flooded major cities, cut electric power to millions, and tore apart densely populated coastlines. But from a meteorological perspective, the storms were very different. Katrina was a textbook tropical cyclone, with a compact, symmetrical wind field that whipped around a circular low-pressure center. Like most tropical cyclones, Katrina was a warm-core storm that drew its energy from the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Sandy had similar characteristics while it was blowing through the tropics. But as the storm moved northward, it merged with a weather system arriving from the west and started transitioning into an extra-tropical cyclone. The names sound similar, but there are fundamental differences between the two types of storms. While tropical cyclones draw their energy from warm ocean waters, extra-tropical cyclones are fueled by sharp temperature contrasts between masses of warm and cool air. Extra-tropical cyclones also tend to be asymmetric, with broad wind and cloud fields shaped more like commas than circles. So when tropical cyclones become extra-tropical, their wind and cloud fields expand dramatically. Their strongest winds generally weaken during this process, but occasionally a transitioning storm retains hurricane force winds, as was the case with Sandy. A pair of wind maps illustrated some of the differences. A map of Sandy's winds produced with data from a radar scatterometer on the Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) Oceansat-2, showed the strength and direction of Sandy's ocean surface winds on October 28, 2012. A map of Hurricane Katrina's winds was made from similar data acquired on August 28, 2005, by a radar scatterometer on NASA's retired QuickSCAT satellite. The most noticeable difference is the extent of the strong wind fields. For Katrina, winds over 65 kilometers per hour stretched about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from edge to edge. For Sandy, winds of that intensity stretched 1,500 kilometers (900 miles). "Katrina's winds were more intense, but they covered less area," said Brian McNoldy, a University of Miami meteorologist who authored a Washington Post article explaining why Sandy's storm surge caused so much damage. "When that boils down to storm surge, Katrina was capable of generating a locally higher surge, but Sandy was capable of generating a destructive surge over a larger length of coastline." Another difference is the location of the strongest winds. For tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere, the strongest winds are usually just east of the eye amidst a ring of violent thunderstorms called the eyewall. "The windfield of Katrina fits this pattern, but for Sandy the weakest winds are to the east-a hint that Sandy has already begun interacting with a system to its northeast and a blocking high to its northeast," noted Penn State meteorologist Jenni Evans, State College, Penn.

Jenni Evans, Bryan Stiles, Brian McNoldy, and Alexander Fore contributed to this feature. On October 29, 2012, lives were changed forever along the shores of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and in the two dozen United States affected by what meteorologists are calling Superstorm Sandy. The landscape of the East Coast was also changed, though no geologist would ever use the word "forever" when referring to the shape of a barrier island. Two aerial photographs show a portion of the New Jersey coastal town of Mantoloking, just north of where Hurricane Sandy made landfall. Both photographs were taken by the Remote Sensing Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The after image on October 31, 2012; the before image was acquired by the same group on March 18, 2007. The images were acquired from an altitude of roughly 7,500 feet, using a Trimble Digital Sensor System. The Mantoloking Bridge cost roughly $25 million when it was opened in 2005 to replace a bridge built in 1938. After Sandy passed through on October 29, 2012, the bridge was covered in water, sand, and debris from houses; county officials closed it because they considered it unstable. On the barrier island, entire blocks of houses along Route 35 (also called Ocean Boulevard) were damaged or completely washed away by the storm surge and wind. Fires raged in the town from natural gas lines that had ruptured and ignited. A new inlet was cut across the island, connected the Atlantic Ocean and the Jones Tide Pond. [image-236]Satellite imagery from Nov. 2 showed that Sandy's remnant clouds continue to linger over Canada and the northeastern U.S. The National Weather Service map for Nov. 2, 2012 showed two areas of low pressure over eastern Canada, near Quebec. That's where the remnants of Sandy are located and the storm's massive cloud cover continues to linger over a large area. That low pressure area is associated with Sandy's remnants. A visible image from NOAA's GOES-13 satellite at 1:31 p.m. EDT on Nov. 2, 2012 showed the remnant clouds from Sandy still linger over the Great Lakes east to New England. In Canada, Sandy's clouds stretch from Newfoundland and Labrador west over Quebec, Ottawa and Toronto. The GOES image was created by NASA's GOES Project at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. By Monday, Nov. 6, the National Weather Service map projects that the low pressure area associated with Sandy's remnants will be offshore. NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or TRMM, satellite acts as a rain gauge in space as it orbits the Earth's tropics. As TRMM flew over Hurricane Sandy since its birth on Oct. 21 it was gathering data that has now been mapped to show how much rain the storm dropped along the U.S. eastern seaboard. Much of the recent deadly flooding along the northeastern United States coastlines was caused by super storm Sandy's storm swell. Strong winds from Sandy persistently pushed Atlantic Ocean waters toward the coast. High tides that occurred at the same time also magnified the effects of the storm swell. Some flooding was also caused by long periods of heavy rainfall that made rivers and streams overflow their banks. The TRMM-based, near-real time Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (MPA) is done at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The MPA monitors rainfall over a large area of the globe (from 60 degrees North latitude to 60 degrees South latitude). MPA rainfall totals over the eastern United States were calculated for the period from October 24-31, 2012 when super storm Sandy was making it's catastrophic transit through the area. The rainfall analysis indicated that the heaviest rainfall totals of greater than 260mm (10.2 inches) were over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Rainfall totals of over 180mm (~ 7 inches) occurred over land in many areas near the Atlantic coast from New Jersey to South Carolina. The reported death toll from hurricane Sandy's flooding and high winds has now reached above 120. Over 70 deaths were caused by Sandy in the Caribbean and recent reports bring the total to greater than 50 in the United States. NOAA's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center issued their last advisory on Sandy's remnants on Oct. 31, stating that "multiple centers of circulation in association with the remnants of Sandy can be found across the lower Great Lakes." A visible image from NOAA's GOES-13 satellite at 1:31 p.m. EDT on Nov. 1, 2012 showed the remnant clouds from Sandy still lingered over the Great Lakes and stretched east to New England and north into Canada. The book on this super storm is now closed, though the clean-up will continue for a long time to come. › View larger image As Hurricane Sandy made a historic landfall on the New Jersey coast during the night of Oct. 29, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on NASA/NOAA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite captured this night-time view of the storm.

Satellite Captures the Life and Death of Hurricane Sandy on Halloween [image-602]Hurricane Sandy is giving up the ghost on Halloween over Penn. As the storm weakened to a remnant low pressure area the NASA GOES Project released an animation of NOAA's GOES-13 satellite imagery covering Hurricane Sandy's entire life. [image-572] The GOES-13 satellite is managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NASA's GOES Project at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. creates images and animations from GOES data. The animation of Sandy's life runs from Oct. 23 through 31. It begins when Tropical Depression 18 strengthened into Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 23, 2012. The animation shows Hurricane Sandy blowing from the Caribbean to the mid-Atlantic where it became wedged between a stationary cold front over the Appalachians and a static high pressure air mass over maritime Canada. The air masses blocked the storm from moving north or east, as it would normally. Instead, their wintery dynamics amplified Sandy and drove it ashore in the mid-Atlantic. Sandy then became a ferocious Nor'easter that brought record storm surges to coastal N.J. and N.Y., plus blizzard conditions to the mountains. Unprecedented chaos occurred in lower New York City, such as flooding the subway system on the evening of Oct. 29. Total damage by the storm was estimated at $20 billion dollars. NOAA's National Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (NOAA/HPC) issued an advisory at 5 a.m. EDT on Oct. 31 that stated there was "no discernible surface circulation." Sandy had weakened to a surface trough (elongated area) of low pressure over western Penn. There are a lot of warnings and watches in effect as Sandy continues to wind down. Gale warnings and small craft advisories are in effect for portions of the great lakes. Small craft advisories are in effect along much of the Mid-Atlantic and northeast coasts. Flood and coastal flood watches, warnings and advisories are in effect over portions of the Mid-Atlantic and northeast states. Coastal flooding along portions of the Great Lakes is also possible. Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories remain in effect for the mountains of southwest Pennsylvania, western Maryland, West Virginia, eastern Tennessee, eastern Kentucky, and extreme western North Carolina. Sandy is appropriately dying on Halloween, but the storm's effects will linger for some time. ›View larger image This image shows ocean surface winds for Hurricane Sandy observed at 9:00 p.m. PDT Oct. 28 (12:00 a.m. EDT Oct. 29) by the OSCAT radar scatterometer on the Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) OceanSat-2 satellite. Colors indicate wind speed and arrows indicate direction. The image shows the large extent of high winds associated with this system. Radar scatterometry enables frequent, more than once per day, observations of Earth's winds over the ocean. This provides additional information to weather forecasters to improve predictions of what areas will be affected by hurricane-level winds. Image credit: ISRO/NASA/JPL-Caltech CloudSat, flying in formation with the A-TRAIN constellation of satellites, provides detailed radar observations of clouds including the vertical distribution of precipitation and cloud structure. At the expense of horizontal resolution, CloudSat observations produce detailed vertical resolution of clouds and precipitation starting at the surface through 19 miles (30 kilometers) in the atmosphere. CloudSat profiles the clouds and distinguishes the amount and type of water, liquid or ice, found throughout these storm systems. CloudSat overpassed an estimated 137 miles (220 kilometers) to the west of Sandy's storm center, which at the time of the overpass was still over the Atlantic Ocean. The satellite overpassed a wide area of moderate precipitation stretching across New York to coastal North Carolina. Maximum cloud top heights from the CloudSat overpass are estimated at 7.5 to 8 miles (12 to 13 kilometers) in height. The brighter colors (orange, red and light pinks) represent greater intensity of the backscattered radar signal from the satellite. These brighter colors correlate to larger raindrops, heavier precipitation and ice or hail depending on the vertical level. The shades of blues and greens represent smaller amounts water and ice particles that correspond to thinner clouds type (cirrus and anvil tops). A nearly continuous area of light and moderate precipitation stretches across the mid-Atlantic region. Near the surface of these areas of light to moderate precipitation, the radar signal measured by CloudSat isn't as strong due to larger sized water droplets that tend to weaken the strength of the signal. The CloudSat observations are an excellent tool for determining cloud layers and heights, precipitating cloud structures and other cloud properties. Part of the CloudSat overpass over the ocean just off the coast of Virginia and North Carolina (denoted by blue line) reveals small pockets of shallow "closed cell" cumulus clouds less than 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) in height. Closed cell cumulus clouds generally represent more stable atmospheric conditions and occur on the back side of mid-latitude cyclones as is the case with Sandy moving onshore. › Download video (mp4) NOAA's GOES satellites captured a global view of Hurricane Sandy's birth to landfall.

Credit: NASA GOES Project [image-174][image-190]NASA's Aqua satellite captured a visible image Sandy's massive circulation. Sandy covers 1.8 million square miles, from the Mid-Atlantic to the Ohio Valley, into Canada and New England. On Oct. 29, 2012 at 11 p.m. EDT, the center of Hurricane Sandy was just 10 miles (15 km) southwest of Philadelphia, Penn., near 39.8 North and 75.4 West. Sandy was still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds near 75 mph (120 kph) and moving northwest at 18 mph (30 kph). Sandy's minimum central pressure had risen to 952 millibars. The hurricane-force-winds extended 90 miles (150 km) east of the center of circulation. Tropical-storm-force winds, however, went much further, as far as 485 miles (780 km). NASA's GOES Project created a "full-disk view" of NOAA's GOES satellite data, that captured a global view of Hurricane Sandy's birth to landfall. The animation of NOAA's GOES-13 and GOES-15 satellite observations were combined from Oct. 21-30, 2012 and showed the birth of Tropical Storm Sandy in the Caribbean Sea, the intensification and movement of Sandy in the Atlantic Ocean along the U.S. East Coast, and Hurricane Sandy make landfall in N.J. on Oct. 29 and move inland to Penn. Sandy's Inland Movement on Oct. 29 At 2 a.m. EDT, on Oct. 29, Sandy's center was located just south of Lancaster, Penn. At 5 a.m. EDT, Sandy continued moving to the west-northwest at 15 knots (24 kph) and was located just 15 miles (24 km) east of York, Penn., and 90 miles (145 km) west of Philadelphia. Sandy was centered near 40.5 North and 77.0 West. Sandy's minimum central pressure continues to rise and was 960 millibars. Sandy's sustained winds were near 65 mph. Tropical-storm-force winds extend almost 1,000 miles. According to Weather Channel, the winds are going to continue being a problem from the northeast into the Ohio Valley today. The strongest winds are being experienced now in the Great Lakes Region. Widespread Damages Hurricane Sandy has caused significant damage in New York City and along the Mid-Atlantic coast. Flooding has been reported from Maine to Va. During the morning hours on Oct. 29 (Eastern Daylight Time), nearly eight million people were without power this morning up and down the East coast. The Appalachian Mtns. received some heavy snow from western Md. down to Tenn. and N.C. As much as 26 inches of snow had fallen in Garrett County, Md. by the morning of Oct. 30. According to Reuters news, flooding along the U.S. East Coast was extensive. Watches and Warnings in Effect on Oct. 29 According to the NOAA's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (NOAA/HPC), there are high-wind warnings in effect including gale force winds over the coastal waters of the Mid-Atlantic States, New York and New England. Storm warnings are in effect for portions of the Mid-Atlantic coastal waters. Flood and flash flood watches and warnings are in effect over portions of the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern states. NOAA's HPC forecast on Oct. 29 calls for Sandy to move in a "west-northwest motion with reduced forward speed is expected today into western Penn. with a turn north into western New York tonight, Oct. 30. The cyclone will move into Canada on Wed., Oct. 31. Steady weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours." NOAA/HPC warns that gale-force winds will continue over parts of the Mid-Atlantic through New England on Oct. 29 and storm surge and tides can still cause normally dry areas along or near the coast to be flooded, especially during high tide. Rain and Snowfall Forecasts from NOAA NOAA/HPC forecasts large rainfall totals for many areas in Sandy's reach. Far northeastern N.C. could expect 3 to 6 inches, while 4 to 8 inches more are possible over the Mid-Atlantic States on Oct. 30. Both areas can see isolated higher totals. Between 1 and 3 inches are possible with up to 5 inches in the southern tier of New York state and northeastward through New England. Snowfall between 2 and 3 feet are expected in the W.Va. mountains with higher totals through Oct. 30. Snowfall of 1 to 2 feet in the southwestern Va. and Ky. Mountains are expected, and between 12 and 18 inches along the N.C. and Tenn. Border and in western Md. › View larger image NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on NASA's Aqua spacecraft captured this infrared image of Hurricane Sandy, another weather front to the west and cold air coming down from Canada at 2:17 p.m. EDT Oct. 29.

Earlier, NASA's CloudSat satellite passed over Hurricane Sandy and its radar dissected the storm get a profile or sideways look at the storm. NASA's Aqua satellite provided an infrared view of the cloud tops and NOAA's GOES-13 satellite showed the extent of the storm. The National Hurricane Center reported at 11 a.m. EDT on Oct. 29 that Hurricane Sandy is "expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and coastal hurricane winds plus heavy Appalachian snows." [image-556]CloudSat Provides a Profile of Hurricane Sandy To understand the structure, extent and behavior of Sandy, NASA's CloudSat passed over Sandy at 1832 UTC (10:32 a.m. EDT) on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2012, when the storm was about 335.5 miles (540 km) southeast of Charleston, S.C. CloudSat data was used to create a profile image of Hurricane Sandy by Shigeru Suzuki at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. At the time of the image Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph and Sandy had a minimum pressure of 961 millibars making the storm a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Sandy was moving slowly to the northeast at 11 mph almost parallel to the southeast United States coast and directly traversing the Gulf Stream. CloudSat passed over Sandy just west of the hurricane's inner core. Light to moderate precipitation associated with parts of the outer bands of Hurricane Sandy were moving on shore into parts of North Carolina where CloudSat intersected the system. CloudSat showed heavier showers and thunderstorms further south and east of the Atlantic coastline over the open water. "The CloudSat signal tends to attenuate or dampen in these areas of heavier convection when rain drops become larger than 3 mm (0.11 inch) in diameter," said Natalie Tourville, a researcher who works with CloudSat data at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colo. "The cloud shield associated with Hurricane Sandy extended well over 1,000 km from the storm center covering parts of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee and Virginia and West Virginia with mid and high level cloudiness areas of cirrus and altocumulus," she said. Sandy Pounding the Mid-Atlantic on Oct. 29 On Oct. 29 at 1 a.m. EDT the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that the center of Hurricane Sandy was located near latitude 37.5 north and longitude 71.5 west. This was about 260 miles (415 km) south-southeast of New York City, and 205 miles (330 km) southeast of Atlantic City, N.J. Sandy was moving north-northwest at 18 mph. Maximum sustained winds have increased to 90 mph (140 kph). According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 485 miles (780 km). Sustained tropical-storm-force winds are occurring along the coasts of southern New Jersey, Delaware, and eastern Virginia, and extend as far inland as the central and southern Chesapeake Bay. NHC noted that surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle and can vary greatly over short distances. Because of Sandy's large wind field, elevated water levels could span multiple tide cycles resulting in repeated and extended periods of coastal and bayside flooding. Dangerous surf conditions will continue from Florida through New England for the next couple of days. [image-252][image-268]NOAA's GOES-13 Satellite Shows Sandy's Extent NOAA's GOES-13 satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Sandy battering the U.S. East coast on Monday, Oct. 29 at 9:10 a.m. EDT that showed the immense extent of the storm. The image was created by the NASA GOES Project at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. Tropical Storm force winds extend almost 500 miles from the center making it almost 1,000 miles in diameter. Other watches and warnings for gale, storm and high winds are in force to the north of the tropical storm warning area and issued by the National Weather Service. Hurricane local statements have also been issued for those areas under tropical storm warning. NASA's Aqua Satellite Infrared Data Shows Sandy's Strength Infrared satellite imagery provides temperature data to forecasters that identify the cloud heights and strength of different parts of a storm. Basically, the higher the cloud top is, the colder the temperature, and the stronger the storm. Strongest storms have the potential for the heaviest rainfall rates. To measure those cloud top temperatures, NASA uses the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. The AIRS instrument captured infrared imagery of Hurricane Sandy on Monday, Oct. 29 at 0711 UTC (3:11 a.m. EDT) that showed some strong thunderstorms and the extent of Sandy's reach from the Carolinas into the Ohio Valley and eastern Canada. The thunderstorms in the purple areas were reaching high into the troposphere where cloud top temperatures are as cold as -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius). Winds from Hurricane Sandy At 11 a.m. EDT on Oct. 29, the National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane-force winds are expected along the U.S. East Coast between Chincoteague, Va.and Chatham, Mass. This Includes the Tidal Potomac from Cobb Island to Smith Point, the middle and upper Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay and the coasts of the northern Delmarva Peninsula, New Jersey, the New York City area, Long Island, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Tropical-storm-force winds are expected north of Chatham to Merrimack River Mass., the lower Chesapeake Bay and south of Chincoteague, Va. to Duck, N.C., the northern endpoint of the Tropical Storm Warning. Rain and Snow Expected from Sandy Hurricane Sandy is expected to bring heavy rainfall to the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern U.S., and snowfall to the mountain areas. The National Hurricane Center bulletin on Oct. 29 at 8 a.m. EDT, noted that rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected over far northeastern N.C. with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches possible. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are expected over portions of the Mid-Atlantic States, including the Delmarva Peninsula with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches possible. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches are possible from the southern tier of New York state northeastward through New England. Snowfall is another expectation from Sandy as Arctic air sits to the west. Blizzard warnings are posted from western Maryland to southwestern Virginia today. Snow accumulations of 2 to 3 feet are expected in the mountains of W.Va. with locally higher totals today through Wed., Oct. 31. Between 1to 2 feet of snow is expected in the mountains of southwestern Va. to the Ky. Border with 12 to 18 inches of snow in the mountains near the N.C. and Tenn. border and in the mountains of Western Md. NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or TRMM satellite can measure rainfall rates and cloud heights in tropical cyclones, and was used to create an image to look into Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 28, 2012. Owen Kelly of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. created this image of Hurricane Sandy using TRMM data. At 2:20 p.m. EDT on Sunday, Oct. 28, Hurricane Sandy was a marginal category 1 hurricane and its eyewall is modest, as TRMM reveals, which gives forecasters and scientists hints about its possible future strength. The eyewall appeared somewhat compact with its 40 km (24.8 miles) diameter. The eyewall contained only relatively light precipitation, and none of Sandy's eyewall storm cells managed to burst through, or even reach, the tropopause which has about a 10 km (6.2 miles) height at mid-latitudes. Evidence of the weak updrafts in the eyewall comes from the fact that the TRMM radar's reflectivity stayed under 40 dBZ, a commonly cited signal strength at which updrafts can be vigorous enough to form hail and to lift smaller ice particles up through the tropopause and into the stratosphere. But placed in context, the TRMM-observed properties of Hurricane Sandy's eyewall are evidence of remarkable vigor. Most hurricanes only have well-formed and compact eyewalls at category 3 strength or higher. Sandy was not only barely a category 1 hurricane, but Sandy was also experiencing strong wind shear, Sandy was going over ocean typically too cold to form hurricanes, and Sandy had been limping along as a marginal hurricane for several days. Kelley said, "With infrared satellite observations used in imagery one can speculate about what the sort of convective (rising air that form the thunderstorms that make up a tropical cyclone) storms are developing under the hurricane's cloud tops, but Sandy was sneaking up the East Coast too far out at sea for land-based radars to provide definitive observations of the rain regions inside of the hurricane's clouds." The radar on the TRMM satellite could provide this missing information during this overflight of Hurricane Sandy. The TRMM satellite also showed that the super-sized rainband that extended to the west and north of the center did contain vigorous storm cells, as indicated by the red regions of radar reflectivity in excess of 40 dBZ. This rainband is expected to lash the coast well before the hurricane's center make landfall. Even further west, at the upper left corner of the image, one can see two small storm cells. These storm cells are the southern-most tip of the independent weather system that is coming across the United States and that is expected to merge and possibly reinvigorate the remnants of Hurricane Sandy after Sandy makes landfall. On Oct. 29 at 5 a.m. EDT the National Hurricane Center noted that the center of Hurricane Sandy was located near latitude 35.9 north and longitude 70.5 west. This was about 410 miles east southeast of Washington, D.C. Sandy was moving north at 15 mph and its winds had increased since Oct. 28. Maximum sustained winds are now near 85 mph. Tropical Storm force winds extend almost 500 miles from the center. At 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 29, the National Hurricane Center reported tropical-storm-force winds were occurring along the coasts of southern New Jersey Delaware and eastern Virginia and extend as far inland as the central and southern Chesapeake Bay. Sandy is forecast to make landfall along the southern new jersey coast tonight. However sandy will severely impact the region well before it comes ashore. TRMM stands for Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, and it is a joint mission between NASA and JAXA, the Japan Space Exploration Agency. Some of the questions about hurricanes left unanswered by the TRMM satellite will be explored by the Global Precipitation Measuring (GPM) satellite scheduled for launch in 2014.

Sandy has drawn energy from a cold front to become a huge storm covering a large area of the eastern United States. NASA satellite imagery provided a look at Sandy's 2,000-mile extent. Hurricane Sandy's reach has grown on satellite imagery, and during the morning of Oct. 28, the storm intensified as there was a large pressure drop. The atmospheric pressure dropped to 951 millibars during the morning of Oct. 28, an eyewall formed. When a storm's atmospheric pressure drops by a large amount as Sandy has done, it's a sign the storm is strengthening tremendously. Sandy continues to merge with a cold front. The combination is expected to bring heavy rainfall and tropical-storm-force sustained winds for a couple of days to the mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States, and cause flooding, downed trees and power outages. The National Hurricane Center warned early on Sunday, Oct. 28, that "Sandy expected to bring life-threatening storm surge flooding to the Mid-Atlantic coast including Long Island sound and New York Harbor, winds expected to be near hurricane force at landfall." Storm surge in the Long Island sound is expected between 6 and 11 feet. NASA and NOAA Satellite Imagery Reveal Sandy's Super-Size The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 26 at 16:10 UTC (12:10 p.m. EDT). The image showed the massive extent of its clouds, covering about 2,000 miles. Sandy's center was in the Bahamas at that time, and an eye was clearly visible. Sandy's western clouds were brushing the southeastern U.S. coast during the time of the image. NOAA's GOES-13 satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 28 at 1302 UTC (9:02 a.m. EDT) that showed the massive extent of the storm, covering about one-third of the U.S. A line of clouds from the Gulf of Mexico stretching north into Sandy's western circulation are associated with the cold front that Sandy is merging with. Sandy's western cloud edge was already over the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern U.S. NASA's TRMM Satellite Sees Super-Soaking Sandy This hybrid Sandy is also a super soaker. NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite can measure rainfall from space. Oct. 27 at 1907 UTC (3:07 p.m. EDT), NASA's TRMM satellite saw that rain associated with Hurricane Sandy storm's center, was moderate and falling at a rate of 20 to 40 mm per hour (1.57 inches per hour). The heaviest rainfall at the time of the image was falling west of the center (and closest to the U.S. East Coast) at a rate of more than 2 inches (50 mm) per hour. During the morning hours of Oct. 28, Sandy has been maintaining a small area of deep (strong) convection (rising air that forms the thunderstorms that make up the hurricane) near the center. The National Hurricane Center has issued Flood Watches for the U.S. East coast and interior areas because Sandy is huge, slow moving and can drop up to 2 inches of rain per hour. Rainfall Totals Forecast As of Oct. 28, 2012, the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches over far northeastern North Carolina with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches possible. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are expected over portions of the mid-Atlantic states, including the Delmarva Peninsula, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches possible. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches are possible from the southern tier of New York State northeastward through New England. Watches and Warnings in Effect Watches and warnings effective Sunday, Oct. 28, included a tropical storm warning in effect from Cape Fear to Duck, N.C., the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and Bermuda. The tropical storm warnings are somewhat misleading for this massive storm because it is expected to bring its tropical-storm-force winds far inland over a period of days. As a result there are high wind warnings and flood watches up and down the mid-Atlantic coast and northeastern United States that extend quite a distance inland, and are too numerous to mention. For weather warnings in your area, visit www.weather.gov and put in your zip code or city and state. Where is Sandy on Sunday, Oct. 28? On Oct. 28 at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 UTC) Sandy's maximum sustained winds were still near 75 mph (120 kph). The National Hurricane Center discussion noted that "there is still some short-term potential for sandy to intensify as a tropical cyclone...especially since it will be traversing the Gulf Stream today." Sandy's center was near 32.1 North latitude and 73.1 west longitude, about 260 miles (420 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. That's also about 395 miles (635 km) south of New York City. Sandy is moving northeast near 10 mph (17 kph) and is expected to continue in that direction for the rest of the day today. However, on Monday, Oct. 28, Sandy is expected to be drawn back to the coast by a low pressure area and turn north and northwest. Sandy will approach the coast of the mid-Atlantic for a landfall late Monday night, Oct. 28. Storm Surge a Serious Factor Storm surge is expected to be big factor as Sandy approaches the mid-Atlantic coast. Very rough surf and high and dangerous waves are expected to be coupled with the full moon. The National Hurricane Center noted that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. The water could reach the following depths above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. The National Hurricane Center identified the following areas for storm surges: South of Surf City, N.C., 1 to 3 feet North of Surf City, N.C. including Pamlico/Albemarle Sounds, 4 to 6 feet Southeastern Virginia and the DelMarVa (Delaware/Maryland/Virginia) peninsula including the lower Chesapeake Bay, 2 to 4 feet Upper and middle Chesapeake Bay, 1 to 2 feet Long Island Sound and Raritan Bay, including New York Harbor, 6 to 11 feet Elsewhere from Ocean City, Md., to the Conn./R.I. border, 4 to 8 feet Conn./R.I. border to the south shore of Cape Cod including Buzzards Bay, 3 to 5 feet Powerful Winds Continue Expanding When a storm becomes extra-tropical and its core changes from warm to cold, the strongest winds spread out and the storm expands. According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane-force winds again expanded on Sunday, Oct. 28, from 100 miles to 175 miles from the center. Tropical-storm-force winds that extended out 450 miles from the center on Sat. Oct. 27 now extend to 520 miles from the center. The wind field of Sandy will continue to grow in size during the next couple of days and impact states from the Carolinas, west to the Ohio Valley, and north into Maine and Canada. Updates on Sandy are available from the National Hurricane Center at: www.nhc.noaa.gov. NASA satellites will continue to provide forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with infrared, visible, cloud height, temperature and rainfall data as Sandy continues to affect the U.S. East Coast. Oct. 27, 2012 - NASA Satellites See Sandy Become a Hurricane Again and Strong Winds Expand [image-220][image-348][image-364]Sandy weakened to a Tropical Storm and strengthened back into a hurricane early on Saturday Oct. 27, and its pressure was dropping, meaning that the storm is intensifying as it becomes an extra-tropical storm. NASA's TRMM satellite identified heavy rain falling within the system and NOAA's GOES satellites provided a picture of Sandy's massive size. NASA's TRMM satellite identified a huge span of moderate rainfall with heaviest rains happening north and east of Sandy's center. NOAA's GOES satellite imagery clearly shows the extent of Sandy's massive cloud cover and the long line of clouds associated with the cold front that stretches from Maine to the Gulf coast. Sandy continues to merge with a cold front and is creating a monster storm with a massive reach. The combination is expected to bring heavy rainfall and tropical-storm-force sustained winds for a couple of days to the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern U.S. beginning late Sunday. Sandy is truly the "bride of Frankenstorm" because the storm's circulation is over 2,000 miles and the wind field of tropical-storm-force winds is hundreds of miles in diameter. The Weather Channel cited a concern for power outages from Maine to Virginia as a result of this storm. NOAA's GOES satellite clearly shows the extent of the monster merging of systems. A hybrid image of NOAA's GOES-13 and GOES-15 satellite created on Oct. 27 by the University of Wisconsin's Space Science and Engineering Center, Madison, provided a full view of the cloud cover from Hurricane Sandy interacting with the long line of clouds associated with the cold front approaching the eastern U.S. The composite image was created using SSEC's McIDAS software and NOAA's GOES imager satellite imagery. Sandy's Effects from the Nation's Capital to the Big Apple Washington, D.C. is in the southern end of the bullseye area of Sandy's huge center, and that target area stretches all the way to New York City. That's just the bullseye area, according to the National Hurricane Center. Because Sandy is thousands of miles wide, the storm's powerful effects will be felt all the way to Maine and include strong winds and flooding rainfall. Coastal flooding a very serious concern along the coasts especially in the vicinity of New York City and Raritan Bay, according to the Weather Channel. Washington, D.C. and New York and all areas in between, including Philadelphia, can expect heavy rain and damaging winds over a couple of days. Because Sandy is coming from the south, the conditions will deteriorate from south to north, with Washington, D.C. feeling the worst effects first. In the Nation's Capital, a flood watch was already posted along the D.C. and Baltimore corridor west to Frederick County, Md. and south to southern Maryland beginning Sunday night, Oct. 27 and extended through Tuesday, Oct. 30. Rainfall will depend on the speed and track of the storm, but heavy rainfall can flood rivers and streams through the rest of the week. Like the heavy rainfall, damaging winds of tropical-storm-force are expected over the same period. Tropical-storm-force winds range between 37 mph and 73 mph. In addition, coastal flooding is a serious concern because of the easterly winds pushing the ocean waters against the shoreline, and this is coupled with higher than normal tides by the current full moon. Hal Pierce of NASA's TRMM Team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. created rainfall and 3-D imagery of the storm that revealed the rate at which rain was falling throughout the mammoth storm, and the heights of the thunderstorms within, which are a clue to the storm's power. The higher the thunderstorms that make up a tropical cyclone, the stronger the overall storm, and the heavier the rainfall in those areas of highest cloud tops. TRMM data showed that rainfall was very heavy in some bands north of Sandy's center of circulation and that Sandy's surface center of circulation is exposed south of the main area of convection. The TRMM rainfall analysis was created using data from two instruments on TRMM: TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR). Pierce created a 3-D view of Sandy, also using TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data that showed that the thunderstorms north of Sandy's center of circulation reached heights of a little above 11km (~6.8 mile). Radar reflectivity values of a little over 45.8dBZ were found in these storms indicating that there were moderate to heavy rain showers in that area. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated that there was significant movement of cold air over the southwest side of Sandy's circulation on Friday, as a result of the cold front moving in from the west. This is expected to speed up Sandy's change to a post-tropical low. Where is Sandy on Saturday, Oct. 27? A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Florida East Coast from Sebastian Inlet to Saint Augustine, South Santee River to Duck including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and Great Abaco and Grand Bahama Islands. A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for the Savannah River to South Santee Rive, the Florida east coast from north of Saint Augustine to Fernandina Beach and Bermuda. On Sat. Oct. 27, at 8 a.m. EDT, Hurricane Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph (120 kph). Sandy is a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane wind scale, and regained hurricane strength after weakening to a tropical storm earlier in the day. Sandy was centered near latitude 28.8 north and 76.8 west. Sandy is moving north-northeast near 10 mph (17 kph) and is expected to turn northeast then north on Oct. 28, while slowing down. The center of Sandy will continue moving away from the northwestern Bahamas this morning and will move parallel to the southeast coast of the United States through the weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. Storm surge is expected to be big factor as Sandy approaches the Mid-Atlantic coast. Very rough surf and high and dangerous waves are expected to be coupled with the full moon. The National Hurricane Center noted that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. The water could reach the following depths above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. Powerful Winds Have Already Expanded As happens when any storm becomes extra-tropical, Sandy will go from a warm to cold core center and the strongest winds spread out and the storm will expand. According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane force winds have expanded on Saturday, Oct. 27 and now extend outward up to 100 miles from the center. On Oct. 26, those hurricane-force winds were only 35 miles out from the center. Tropical-storm-force winds have also expanded over a huge area on Sat. Oct. 27 and now extend 450 miles from the center! Just a day before, those tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 275 miles (445 km). The wind field of Sandy will contine to grow in size during the next couple of days. The storm's circulation now reaches more than 2,000 miles. NASA satellites will continue to provide forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with infrared, visible, cloud height, temperature and rainfall data as Sandy closes in on the U.S. East Coast. Updates on Sandy are available from the National Hurricane Center at: www.nhc.noaa.gov. Oct. 26, 2012, second update- NASA Sees Hurricane Sandy as the "Bride of Frankenstorm" Approaching U.S. East Coast [image-380][image-396][image-412]NASA's TRMM satellite revealed Hurricane Sandy's heavy rainfall and the storm is expected to couple with a powerful cold front and Arctic air to bring that heavy rainfall to the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern U.S. Some forecasters are calling this combination of weather factors "Frankenstorm" because of the close proximity to Halloween. However, because Sandy is a woman's name, the storm could be considered a "bride of Frankenstorm." NASA satellites have provided forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with rainfall data, infrared, visible and other data on Sandy and will continue to do so. Dr. Marshall Shepherd who works with TRMM data provided an insight into the storm's development. NASA's TRMM Satellite Sees Sandy Drench Jamaica and Eastern Cuba The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite had a partial view of hurricane Sandy on Oct. 25 at 1425 UTC (10:25 a.m. EDT) after it had passed over Cuba and moved into the Bahamas. An eye was hard to find but TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) data showed that a large area of intense rainfall was occurring around Sandy's center of circulation. Hal Pierce of NASA's TRMM Team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. used a GOES-13 satellite image captured at the same time to fill in the part of the image not viewed by TRMM to create a total picture of the storm. With its combination of passive microwave and active radar sensors, TRMM is ideally suited to measure rainfall from space. For increased coverage, TRMM can be used to calibrate rainfall estimates from other additional satellites. The TRMM-based, near-real time Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) made at NASA Goddard can be used to rainfall over a wide portion of the globe. TMPA rainfall totals were tallied for the seven-day period from Oct. 18-25, 2012.The heaviest rainfall occurred over open ocean where totals were as high as 325 millimeters. Rainfall amounts as high as 250 millimeters were measured over eastern Cuba and some extreme southern areas of Hispaniola. Hurricane Sandy passed over the islands of Jamaica and Cuba causing at least 21 deaths. Extensive flooding and other damage were reported near the capital city of Kingston and other areas of Jamaica. National Hurricane Center Rainfall Expectations The heavy rainfall potential is evident in the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) forecast on Oct. 26. The NHC noted that Sandy is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches across Haiti and the Dominican Republic with isolated maximum totals of 20 inches possible. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected over portions of the Bahamas with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches possible. Rainfall totals of one to three inches are expected across the Florida Keys into southeastern and east-central Florida with isolated maximum amounts of six inches possible. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are possible over far eastern North Carolina. Interview with Research Meteorologist Dr. Marshall Shepherd Dr. Marshall Shepherd, University of Georgia Professor and Research Meteorologist has worked with TRMM satellite data since its launch in 1997. Dr. Shepherd provided his take on the storm event. "Models are coming into consensus on a landfall, if you will, in the DelMarVa area. Comparisons are being made to the Perfect Storm of 1991, but many folks won't remember that. Storm will bring very strong winds (hurricane force) over a strong area. Remember the Derecho of June 29, 2012. Expand that to the entire Delaware/Maryland/Virginia and New York/New Jersey region." Shepherd said that the event will bring significant rains and inland freshwater flooding , that he said was often the deadliest threat from tropical systems. He also cited concerns about the storm surge and coastal flooding as full moon will mean elevated water levels/tides coupled with the storm-induced surge. Finally, he noted, there is likely to be heavy wet snow into the inland and higher elevations of the effected region. "Pay attention to the cone or area of influence rather than a specific track as the storm will affect an area not a point," he said. "Advances from NASA satellites, aircraft, and models are essential for ingest into the models, assessing storm locations and intensity, and testing future modeling techniques. It may not be obvious to many, but our warning and prediction capability does have traceability to the NASA program in numerous ways and I have been happy to play some small role as a former NASA scientist and current member of the NASA Precipitation Science Team and Earth Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council."

Credit NASA/NOAA GOES Project Where is Sandy on Friday, Oct. 26? A Hurricane Warning is in effect for the Northwestern Bahamas Except Andros Island. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Central Bahamas, Florida East Coast from Ocean Reef to Flagler Beach, Lake Okeechobee and Andros Island in the northwestern Bahamas. A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Savannah River to Oregon Inlet North Carolina, Pamlico Sound, the Florida east coast from North of Flagler Beach to Fernandina Beach, the Florida Upper Keys from Ocean Reef to Craig Key, and Florida Bay. On Friday, Oct. 26, at 8 a.m. EDT, Hurricane Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 80- mph (130 kph). Sandy is a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane wind scale. Some weakening is possible during the next day or so, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was centered near latitude 26.4 north and longitude 76.9 west. Sandy is moving northwest near 10 mph (17 kph) and is expected to turn north and then northeast on Oct. 27, while slowing down. Storm surge is expected to be big factor as Sandy approaches the Mid-Atlantic coast. Very rough surf and high and dangerous waves are expected to be coupled with the full moon. The National Hurricane Center noted that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. The water could reach the following depths above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. Some storm surge forecasts include: 5 to 8 feet in the hurricane warning area in the Bahamas and one to three feet along the Florida coast in the warning areas on Oct. 26. GOES-13 Satellite Shows Sandy and Powerful Cold Front NOAA's GOES-13 satellite monitors weather over the eastern U.S. and the Atlantic Ocean. In a visible image taken from NOAA's GOES-13 satellite on Friday, Oct. 26 at 1415 UTC (10:15 a.m. EDT) Hurricane Sandy's huge cloud extent of up to 2,000 miles extended into the Atlantic, while its center was over the Bahamas. At the same time a long line of clouds associated with a powerful cold front approaching the U.S. east coast stretched from the upper Midwest to the Gulf coast. The image was created by the NASA GOES Project at NASA Goddard. "Bride of Frankenstorm" Hurricane Sandy is expected to mix with a powerful cold front approaching the east coast, and cold Arctic Air mass, setting up for a powerful storm, a "Bride of Frankenstorm." The cold front stretching from the upper Midwest to the Gulf coast is moving eastward and is expected to temporarily push Sandy away from the coast. However, the front is expected to break down as it moves toward the coast, allowing Hurricane Sandy to come back toward the coast. As happens when any storm becomes extra-tropical, Sandy will go from a warm to cold core center and the strongest winds spread out and the storm will expand. According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km). The wind field of Sandy is expected to grow in size during the next couple of days. The storm's circulation almost reaches 2,000 miles. Although landfall is expected in southeastern Delaware early Tuesday morning as a hurricane, the Mid-Atlantic is expected to start feeling the storm's effect starting Sunday, Oct. 28. For updates on Hurricane Sandy's forecast, go to the National Hurricane Center: www.nhc.noaa.gov Early in the morning on October 25, 2012, the Suomi NPP satellite passed over Hurricane Sandy after it made landfall over Cuba and Jamaica, capturing this highly detailed infrared imagery, showing areas of deep convection around the central eye. Besides the highly detailed infrared imagery, the satellite's day night band captured detailed visible-like imagery of the cloud tops, along with the city lights of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. As most polar-orbiting satellites fly over an area, the visible and infrared sensors scan left to right. Data in the center part of the scan typically has the highest resolution and quality; farther out in the scan, the imagery gets distorted. An improvement in the Suomi NPP's VIIRS sensor over its predecessors reduces the loss of data quality along the length of the scan. Hurricane Sandy is a perfect example of the importance of this improvement – both times the satellite passed over Sandy on October 25th in consecutive orbits, the storm was on the edge of the scan area, which would have meant decreased image quality from previous satellites, but not Suomi NPP. Only at the very limits of the imagery (left hand side) can the edge of scan issues be seen in the day-night band image. These distortions would be much more pronounced in similar imagery from AVHRR or MODIS. When NASA's Terra satellite flew over Hurricane Sandy around noon local time on Oct. 25, it captured a visible image of Hurricane Sandy that showed the large extent of the storm. Sandy has grown since the morning hours on Oct. 25 by about 120 miles in diameter according to satellite data. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Terra satellite captured this visible image of Hurricane Sandy over the Bahamas on Oct. 25 at 1530 UTC (11:30 a.m. EDT). The MODIS image revealed strong thunderstorms in its southern arm, positioned over the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and eastern Puerto Rico. The center of the storm was moving through the Bahamas, and the northwestern edge had already spread clouds over southern Florida. At 2 p.m. EDT on Oct. 25, Sandy's maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 kph). The storm is a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale. Sandy's center was located near 23 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 75 degrees 24 minutes west longitude, just 25 miles (40 km) east of Great Exuma Island, Bahamas. Sandy is moving toward the north near 20 mph (32 kph) and this motion is expected to continue followed by a turn toward the north-northwest. Sandy is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves through the Bahamas. This video shows Hurricane Sandy as seen from the International Space Station At 11 a.m. EDT, tropical-storm-force winds extended up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center, making Sandy more than 280 miles in diameter. By 2 p.m. EDT, just more than three hours later, Sandy had grown. Sandy's tropical storm-force-winds now extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center, making the storm about 410 miles in diameter. High pressure rotating clockwise over New England may be set up to push Sandy toward the mid-Atlantic as a cold front approaches from the west. Various computer models are showing different scenarios for Oct. 29's weather along the U.S. East Coast. The current forecast track from the National Hurricane Center brings Sandy in for a landfall in central New Jersey on Tuesday, Oct. 30. Regardless, it appears that Sandy may be a strong wind event for the U.S. mid-Atlantic and Northeast. An animation of NOAA's GOES-13 satellite observations from Oct. 23-25, 2012, show Hurricane Sandy move over Jamaica and cross over eastern Cuba. At 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 25, 2012, Hurricane Sandy had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph and was just 75 miles northeast of Holguin, Cuba.This visualization was created by the NASA GOES Project at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., using observations from NOAA's GOES-13 satellite. Credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project NASA Sees Power in Hurricane Sandy Moving Toward Bahamas [image-540] NASA's Aqua satellite passed over Hurricane Sandy as it was moving over eastern Cuba early on Oct. 25. The AIRS instrument captured an infrared image of Sandy that showed a large area of very high, cold cloud tops indicating the power within the storm. Sandy is now headed toward the Bahamas and warnings and watches have already been posted for the mainland U.S. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured infrared imagery of Hurricane Sandy's eastern half on Oct. 25 at 0559 UTC (1:59 a.m. EDT) that showed some strong thunderstorms around the eye of Sandy. Those thunderstorms are reaching high into the troposphere where cloud top temperatures are as cold as -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius). In previous studies, those areas where the temperatures were that cold indicated heavy rainfall. By 11 a.m. EDT on Oct. 25, the eye was no longer apparent in satellite imagery or from aircraft observations. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center noted that Sandy "has become somewhat disrupted on the western side by southwesterly flow from an upper-level low to the west." Current Watches and Warnings A Hurricane Warning is in effect for the Ragged Islands in the southeastern Bahamas, the Central Bahamas, the Northwestern Bahamas. A Tropical Storm Warning is in the effect for the Florida east coast from Ocean Reef to Flagler Beach, Lake Okeechobee, and the remainder of the southeastern Bahamas. In addition, a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for the Florida east coast from North of Flagler Beach to Fernandina Beach, Florida Upper Keys from Ocean Reef to Craig Key and Florida Bay. Discontinued Watches and Warnings As of 11 a.m. EDT several watches and warnings have been dropped as Sandy continues moving north. Cuba has discontinued the hurricane warning for the provinces of Camaguey, Las Tunas, Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, and Guantanamo. The tropical storm warning for Haiti has also been discontinued although heavy rains and gusty winds are expected to continue there today, Oct. 25. Where is Sandy Now? According to the National Hurricane Center, at 11 a.m. EDT on Thursday, Oct. 25, Hurricane Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 105 mph (165 kph) with higher gusts. Sandy is a category two hurricane on the saffir- Simpson hurricane wind scale. Hurricane force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the center, while tropical-storm-force winds go up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center, making Sandy move than 280 miles in diameter. As a storm weakens, it tends to grow larger, so forecasters are closely watching Sandy. Sandy is located near latitude 22.4 north and longitude 75.5 west. That's about 65 miles (110 km) south-southwest of Long Island, Bahamas and about 85 miles (135 km) south-southeast of Great Exuma Island. Sandy is moving toward the north near 16 mph (26 kph) and is expected to continue in that direction today, and turn north-northwest and slow down. The center of Sandy will move through the Central Bahamas later on Oct. 25 and through the northwestern Bahamas on Friday, Oct. 26. Sandy is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves through the Bahamas. In Florida, local hurricane statements have been issued for Miami, Jacksonville, Melbourne and Key West. For more information about rainfall, winds and storm surge, visit the National Hurricane Center website at www.nhc.noaa.gov. This animation of NOAA's GOES-13 satellite observations from Oct. 21-24, 2012, shows Tropical Storm Sandy become a hurricane just before making landfall in Jamaica and Tropical Storm Tony form and strengthen in the central Atlantic Ocean. Sandy became a hurricane on Oct. 24 at 11 a.m. EDT when its maximum sustained winds hit 80 mph (130 kph). At that time, it was centered about 65 miles (100 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica, near 17.1 North and 76.7 West.

(Credit: NASA GOES Project)› Download video [image-428][image-444]NASA satellites are closely monitoring Tropical Storm Sandy in visible and infrared light as it approaches Jamaica. Sandy is now responsible for hurricane and tropical storm warnings and watches from Jamaica to Cuba, the Bahamas and southern Florida. Sandy is expected to become a hurricane before it reaches Jamaica and Cuba. On Oct. 23, 2012 at 1545 UTC (11:45 a.m. EDT), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument captured a visible image of Tropical Storm Sandy when its center was a couple of hundred miles south of Jamaica. Sandy's clouds filled up the eastern Caribbean Sea, and showed signs of good circulation. The MODIS image revealed that Sandy's cloud cover extends over 280 miles (440 km). Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured infrared imagery of Tropical Storm Sandy later that day at 2:47 p.m. EDT. The infrared image showed the strongest thunderstorms surrounded the center of circulation. Those thunderstorms are reaching high into the troposphere where cloud top temperatures are as cold as -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius). On Oct. 24, the warnings and watches posted covered a large area. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Jamaica, the Cuban Provinces of Camaguey, Las Tunas, Granma, Santiago De Cuba, Holguin, and Guantanamo. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Haiti, the Central Bahamas, and the Northwestern Bahamas. A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for the Southeastern Bahamas, the Florida East Coast from Jupiter Inlet to Ocean Reef, the Florida Upper Keys from Ocean Reef to Craig Key, and Florida Bay. At 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 24, Tropical Storm Sandy's maximum sustained winds were on the edge of hurricane-force at 70 mph (110 kph). Hurricane strength is 74 mph. Sandy's center was located near latitude 16.6 north and longitude 76.9 west, just 95 miles (155 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica. Sandy is moving toward the north near 14 mph (22 kph) and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that this general motion is expected to continue through Thursday (Oct. 25) accompanied by a gradual increase in forward speed. According to NHC forecasters, the center of Sandy is expected to move across Jamaica by late this afternoon and evening today, Oct. 24 and move near or over eastern Cuba late tonight and Thursday morning. Oct. 25. Sandy is then expected to approach the central Bahamas on Thursday. [image-460][image-476][image-492]The eighteenth tropical depression only took six hours to strengthen into Tropical Storm Sandy, confirming NASA research that sighting of hot towers leads to intensification. Sandy may further intensify into a hurricane and watches and warnings have been posted in the Caribbean Sea. On Oct. 23, a Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning were in effect for Jamaica, and a tropical storm watch was in effect for Haiti. A low pressure center in the southwestern Caribbean sea was upgraded to Tropical Depression 18 by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) yesterday, Oct. 22 at 1500 UTC (11:00 a.m. EDT). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, otherwise known as TRMM passed directly above the newly formed tropical depression on October 22, 2012 at 1533 UTC (October 21, 2012 at 11:33 p.m. EDT). TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) data were used to determine the rainfall rates occurring within the depression and the newly formed tropical depression was already showing good organization. Some intense convective storms near the center of circulation dropping rain at a rate of about 50 mm (~2 inches) per hour. NASA's 3-D Look at Tropical Storm Sandy A 3-D perspective was made at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. using data from TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) from the orbit. Powerful storms called "hot towers" located near the center of TD18's circulation were reaching altitudes of over 14 km (~8.7 miles). Towering thunderstorms like these at the center of tropical cyclones are often a sign of intensification. A "hot tower" is a rain cloud that reaches at least to the top of the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The troposphere peaks around nine miles (14.5 km) high in the tropics. The towering clouds are called "hot" because they rise to such altitude due to the large amount of latent heat. Water vapor releases this latent heat as it condenses into liquid. NASA scientists Owen Kelley and John Stout of George Mason University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., found that a tropical cyclone with a hot tower around its center of circulation was twice as likely to intensify within the next six hours, than a cyclone that lacked a tower. That's exactly what happened on Oct. 22, when TRMM spotted hot towers in Tropical Depression 18. It became Tropical Storm Sandy just six hours later. Sandy's Stats on Oct. 23 On Oct. 23 at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 UTC), Tropical Storm Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph (75 kph) and the National Hurricane Center expects the storm to strengthen over the next two days. The center of Tropical Storm Sandy was located near latitude 13.4 north and longitude 77.9 west, about 325 miles (525 km) south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. Sandy was moving to the north-northeast near 3 mph (6 kph) and is expected to continue in that direction for the next two days taking the center of the tropical storm near or over Jamaica on Wed. Oct. 24. Sandy's estimated minimum central pressure is 997 millibars. NASA Infrared Data on Sandy Infrared satellite imagery captured on Oct. 23 at 0617 UTC (2:17 a.m. EDT) from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite showed that there are bands of strong thunderstorms east of Sandy's center of circulation . Those bands of thunderstorms are reaching high into the troposphere where cloud top temperatures are as cold as -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius). Sandy's Wind, Rain, Storm Surge Tropical storm winds are expected to reach Jamaica during the night-time hours of Oct. 23 or early morning hours on Wed. Oct. 24. The National Hurricane Center noted that "hurricane conditions expected on Wed. Hurricane conditions are also possible in eastern Cuba by Wed. night. Tropical storm conditions are possible in Haiti on Oct. 24, and in central and southeastern Bahamas on Thurs. Oct. 24. Sandy is expected to be a big rainmaker, generating between six and 12 inches across Jamaica, Haiti , the Domenican Republic and eastern Cuba. Isolated rainfall totals could reach 20 inches. In addition, storm surges are expect to raise water levels between one and three feet above normal tide levels. The National Hurricane Center expects Sandy to strengthen into a hurricane over the next couple of days. [image-508][image-524]Tropical Depression 18 (TD18) formed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea at 11 a.m. EDT on Oct. 22, and NASA's TRMM satellite saw a "hot towering" thunderstorm near its center of circulation hinting that it could become a tropical storm soon. A tropical storm watch has been issued for Jamaica. When NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite flew over the developing TD18 early on Oct. 22 at 0040 UTC (Oct. 21 at 8:40 p.m. EDT), the satellite measured rainfall rates within the low pressure area and measured cloud heights of the thunderstorms that make up the low. TRMM noticed that the developing depression had a "hot towering" thunderstorm over 9.3 miles (15 kilometers) high. That same area also revealed heavy rainfall where rain was falling at 2 inches/50 mm per hour. Hot Towers are towering clouds that emit a tremendous amount of latent heat (that's why they're called "hot" towers). NASA research indicates that whenever a hot tower is spotted, a tropical cyclone will likely intensify within 6 or more hours, and the low pressure system intensified into a tropical depression. Satellite data also showed that the depression also has a closed surface circulation and the banding of thunderstorms around the center has increased during the early morning hours on Oct. 22. These are all signs that the depression is getting more organized. At 11 a.m. EDT, TD18 had maximum sustained winds near 30 mph (45 kph). It was located near 13.5 North latitude and 78.0 West longitude, about 320 miles (515 km) south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. TD18 was moving to the southwest at 5 mph 7 kph) and had a minimum central pressure of 1003 millibars. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that a tropical storm warning could be needed later in the day on Monday, Oct. 22 for Jamaica. Also, interests in eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas should monitor the progress of this system. According to NHC, the depression is expected to drift westward and the turn to the north-northeast on Oct. 23 and 24. The forecast track takes TD18's center near Jamaica during the night-time hours on Oct. 23. Tropical Depression 18 was born from the low pressure area formerly known as System 99L. The NHC expects TD18 to strengthen and become a tropical storm later on Oct. 22 or on Oct. 23. Once the depression becomes a tropical storm it would be renamed "Tropical Storm Sandy." In addition to the new tropical depression, there's another area that forecasters are watching in the Atlantic. System 90L is producing showers and thunderstorms in the central Atlantic about 700 miles east-northeast of the Leeward Islands. During the morning hours of Oct. 22, the showers had become a little better organized, and the NHC gives the low a 50 percent chance of becoming the nineteenth tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season.

The good, the bad, and the ugly … learning from Hurricane Sandy There’s lots of very bad and ugly. Sandy will likely become one of our costliest natural disasters. But the science got the storm right. Looking back at the entire track of Superstorm/Frankenstorm/Non-Tropical Cyclone/Extratropical Cyclone Sandy (yes, the storm has had a bunch of names!), it is really amazing to see how it formed and how the science got this storm right. It also gave me a horrible feeling about what could come out of this storm, as I knew so many deadly scenarios were in play. I have decided to highlight the good, the bad, and ugly parts about Hurricane Sandy. While most of this was simply ugly, there were a few good things that came out of this forecast. Let’s take a look back at Hurricane Sandy and see what went right and what went wrong. The Good: One word: Science The forecast for Sandy was fantastic, and could be considered as one of the finest moments in meteorology. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, also known as ECMWF or the European model, nailed down the track of Sandy a week before the storm pushed into southern New Jersey. The Europeans have more money invested into their weather model, and it uses 4D data assimilation unlike our American model, the Global Forecast System (GFS). Seven days before the event, the GFS model insisted that Sandy would push out to sea and possibly affect Bermuda. However, run after run of consistent forecasts, the European model kept its solution of a New England storm affecting millions of people. With such a huge concern about Sandy, NOAA decided that the local national weather services should launch special radiosondes (weather balloons) every six hours to get a better measure of what was happening within our atmosphere. These measurements about barometric pressure, temperature, wind speeds with height, and so much more was able to help the models create better runs so meteorologists would have a better idea of the track of the storm. If one feature pushed out or formed differently, it could easily change the track of Sandy. Using weather satellites such as GOES-13, which monitors the Eastern Seaboard and Atlantic ocean, can also help us not only get visible images of Earth from outer space, but it also grabs a lot of data and information that we also use in our weather models. If you can recall, GOES-13 experienced a lot of noise and had to be replaced by a temporary satellite until it was fixed a few months ago. The track for Sandy was great. The weather models and the NHC has a great forecast for the track of Hurricane Sandy. Image Credit: NOAA I wrote a post about how we may begin to see a rapid decline in U.S. satellites in the near future. According to a report from the National Research Council in early 2012, U.S. satellites in orbit are expected to decline from 23 in 2012 to only six in the year of 2020. Long-running missions to build and launch satellites are undergoing delays, missions are being cut as budgets are cut, and there have been some inevitable launch failures, plus changes in mission design and scope. If we do not improve these problems, then all of the progress we have made in the study of atmospheric sciences will be for nothing. Now, do you see how important it is to fund and receive full support for NOAA/NASA? If we never had satellites or weather models, then what happened on Monday evening, October 29, 2012 could have been another repeat of the 1938 Long Island hurricane that swept New York by surprise and killed hundreds of people. Fortunately, science prevailed and gave us plenty of time to warn the general public about the danger of Hurricane Sandy. The Bad: -Confusion I will state this first: I know there are plenty of people that took this storm seriously. If people were told to evacuate their homes, then many people did. However, there was confusion regarding the storm and its impact. For instance, do you remember Hurricane Irene from last year? Although the storm caused significant flooding and damage across New England, it was no where near the sense of dangerous as originally hyped. For some people, Irene was not a big deal. This “false” sense of being safe can really get people in trouble, and I find that to be a huge issue. You will find a few meteorologists who “hype” storms every now and then simply for ratings. When it comes to listening to people for weather information, it call comes down to who you trust and listen to. When meteorologists and local NWS decide to use strong wording in their forecasts and discussions to give the public a sense of urgency and that danger is near, you should always listen. When I wrote up a post about Sandy, I decided to title it “Hurricane Sandy is dangerous” to give everyone a sense that this storm means business. One huge area of concern I had was the process of not issuing hurricane watches or warnings along the New Jersey and New York coasts. The original idea from the National Hurricane Center was that this storm would become extratropical and thus not be a hurricane as it pushed inland. I understand the science of how it works regarding the transition of a warm core low becoming a cold core. However, the general public does not understand. Instead of issuing hurricane warnings, the NHC gave the local NWS offices to issue their own warnings. Some of the warnings such as “High wind warnings” were not only issued along the coasts where Sandy was suppose to make landfall, but these warnings were also issued as far south as North Georgia. My issue: Does the general public understand the definition of a high wind warning? I will admit, I had to double check the definition myself to understand what it truly means. High Wind Warning definition: A warning for sustained surface winds greater than 40 mph/64 kph lasting more than an hour or winds over 58 mph/93 kph over land that are either predicted or occurring for an unspecified period of time. For some people, this definition simply tells them that it will be very windy outside. However, does it really strike concern for most people? Personally, I believe the National Hurricane Center should have issued hurricane warnings. Many meteorologists via social media questioned their actions, and I am sure this will still be a topic that will be mentioned in future discussions about the warning process of Hurricane Sandy. This topic got so out of hand, the National Hurricane Center actually released a PDF online explaining their actions of not issuing hurricane warnings. -Social Media If you follow social media, you probably had information overload regarding Hurricane Sandy. At one point, there were confirmations that the New York Stock Exchange was flooding. Twenty minutes later, we had a new confirmation that this was not the case. In fact, the biggest thing that bothers me is when people post fake images. Everytime a major storm hits part of the United States, people tend to grab the same images over and over and claim it was from that particular event. I saw it during Hurricane Katrina, and I also saw it during the April 14-15, 2012 tornado outbreak across the Central Plains. Here’s my favorite example of the fake picture that circulated online: Fake image that circulated through social media claiming Hurricane Sandy was producing a supercell over New York City. Really? Image Credit: Who cares I will admit though, the image below is a little more believable. No? In attack of the spread of fake images online, someone decided to add a little humor to the situation. Either way, putting out fake images adds confusion for broadcast meteorologists/journalists who are trying to showcase what is actually happening during an event. If you are out there and think it is funny to photoshop old storms and claim it was something else, it isn’t. I cannot tell you how many times I have seen fake hail images, supercell structures that occurred a decade ago, and more. It is important to know who you follow when it comes to getting information. Is the source reliable? If so, you should still double check the picture. Sometimes, the photos are so good, that even reliable sources get fooled. I will admit, it has happened to me. As of now, at least 81 people in the U.S. have died from Sandy. Many of the deaths occurred from trees falling on cars and buildings. Sandy is also responsible for 67 deaths in the Caribbean, and two deaths in Canada. Overall, at least 150 people have passed away from this brutal storm. The damage has been extensive and beyond comprehensible, especially along the Jersey shore. There is no doubt Sandy reshaped the coastline as storm surge brought piles of sand well inland and destroyed homes and bridges along the coast. Many houses were simply pushed off its foundation and shifted to a different location. Cars were buried in water, and the subway stations flooded. There is no doubt in my mind that Hurricane Sandy will rank as one of the top three costliest weather disasters in United States history. Prayers go out to all of the victims that are fighting through this horrible tragedy. Bottom line: The forecasts for Sandy were excellent, and the ECMWF weather model saw this storm developing and pushing into the Mid-Atlantic/New England about eight days before actual landfall. I believe there could have been confusion regarding the lack of hurricane watches and warnings that were not issued for portions New Jersey and New York. As the storm hit, social media was excellent on getting real time information as it came in. However, there were a lot of fake images that were being shared around. I wish this never happened, but it tends to be the case whenever a significant weather event occurs. Finally, the ugly part of Sandy is the death and destruction that has occurred not only in the United States, but also in the Caribbean. The death count has surpassed over 150 deaths, which is one too many. Prayers go out to everyone affected by Hurricane Sandy.

Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Prepared for Sandy By the light of day on Tuesday, millions of people in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut looked around at flooded streets and broken trees and realized that this time the official alarms were right. Gov. Dannel Malloy, who closed major highways and begged people to leave the shore, predicted a catastrophe. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York declared a state of emergency three days in advance. A very grim and very tired-looking mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, assessed the city’s widespread damage and said simply, “We expected an unprecedented storm impact here in New York City, and that’s what we got.” Only a day before, there were plenty of people grumbling about the latest nanny-alert from Mayor Bloomberg. Some, in low-lying areas were resisting his pleas to move away from the water. While the skies were still clear, there was grousing about closed tunnels and blocked highways and empty subway stations. People in Atlantic City gambled that the politicians were exaggerating. Some failed to heed the warning from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to leave; and, in his typical combative way, the governor called holdouts “both stupid and selfish.” A few hours later, some of the holdouts were helplessly stranded and needing assistance. Hurricane Sandy was as devastating as meteorologists and political leaders had predicted. At least 39 people have died, a number that could rise as work crews move into flooded coastline areas. The storm wiped out power for roughly eight million people in the mid-Atlantic region. A blizzard connected to the storm suddenly dumped two feet of snow in Appalachia. In Lower Manhattan, much of the financial hub around Wall Street went dark Monday night as water poured into the streets from the New York harbor. Tunnels flooded. Water washed into the subways and surged over the platforms. And despite efforts to move subway cars out of the water’s reach, the damage to the city’s underground tunnels was considerable. While buses and taxis began moving again in New York City on Tuesday, the subways will take longer. The “unwatering” team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency moved into Lower Manhattan to drain the complex substructure under the streets. Cleanup crews began working up and down the coast, from the towns along the New Jersey shore to a devastated stretch of Long Island. Power will return in patches, officials across the region said. Mayor Bloomberg, who was out of the city when a deadly snowstorm hit in 2010, did it right this time. He and the governors issued strong warnings for what turned out to be a dire storm. Now comes the second and harder part, bringing it all back to normal. A version of this editorial appears in print on October 31, 2012, on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Prepared for Sandy. Today's Paper|Subscribe
Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation State-by-State Guide to Hurricane Sandy Last Updated | 6:50 a.m., Wednesday Oct. 31 – We are taking a state-by-state look at the devastation caused in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, including unprecedented flooding damage in New Jersey and New York City, where the subway system will be shut down for at least four days, as our colleagues report. An interactive map shows where millions of people across the Northeast were still without power on Wednesday and this list outlines transportation and other services that are operating. At least 50 people have been killed during the mammoth storm across the country, including 22 people in New York. New York Times reporters are delivering live updates from across the region and the Northeast, and Google has built a crisis response map with updates on utilities and other services across storm-stricken areas. CONNECTICUT While along the coast, residents and business owners were still reeling from the devastation left after the storm, Connecticut’s inland cities and towns, despite widespread power failures, were getting back to normal on Wednesday. State employees were told to report to work on Wednesday. Most of the major roads were reopened, although crews were continuing to remove downed branches and power lines as utility crews worked to restore power for hundreds of thousands of customers. Metro-North and Amtrak service was not operating. Some bus service was restored. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy spent seven hours Tuesday touring the damage from the storm along the coastline, stopping in multiple towns, including Fairfield, East Haven and Greenwich. WTNH-TV reporting on Tuesday from Milford, Conn., which was badly hit by Hurricane Sandy. At least three people died as a result of the storm that flooded low-lying areas in coastal towns and left hundreds of thousands of people without power, reported The Hartford Courant on Tuesday. As of a few minutes ago, approximately 630,000 customers were without power More than 360,000 people were evacuated over the weekend from low-lying areas along the coast from Old Saybrook to Fairfield amid growing concern about flooding from the hurricane’s surge in Long Island Sound. WTNH-TV in Hartford delivered this report on the damage the storm caused to Metro-North. WTNH-TV providing an update on the damage the storm caused to Metro-North After Hurricane Irene last year, power companies in Connecticut were harshly criticized for taking more than a week to restore power to tens of thousands of customers. Luther Turmelle, a reporter for The New Haven Register, reports that Connecticut could once again expect widespread power failures: Jim Torgerson of United Illuminating’s parent company: We expect 50 to 70 percent of our customers to be without power. #ctsandy DELAWARE Brian Stelter, reporting for The New York Times from Delaware on Tuesday, produced a video showing parts of Lewes, where floodwaters rose even before Hurricane Sandy landed to the north. His report: “New Jersey’s neighbor to the south, Delaware, saw flooding in predictable spots, including along the coastal highway that connects its resorts to Ocean City, Md. But the biggest beach town here, Rehoboth Beach, fared well, with minimal damage visible on Tuesday morning as the sun tried to break through the clouds. Fears of a ripped-up boardwalk did not come to pass, nor was there any evident structural damage in downtown. A few miles north in Lewes, a low-lying town at the edge of the Delaware Bay, the surge that had surrounded some homes was starting to recede on Tuesday morning, and backhoes were starting to clear away the sand that had piled into parking lots and side streets.” South of Lewes in Rehoboth Beach, the surge tugged sand fences out to sea and swept over the dunes in some spots, leaving seashells and other debris on the boardwalk. But the boardwalk survived. Rehoboth beach & boardwalk are fine. Grottos is open & people are there w kids & dogs #Sandy #HurricaneSandy //t.co/AW4BKWzM Over the weekend, evacuations were mandatory in flood-prone parts of the state, from Fenwick Island on the southern border with Maryland to New Castle, a hundred miles north. People began returning to their homes and many roads and bridges reopened on Tuesday, but flooding remained a problem in some areas. TRANSPORTATION: Most highways were open except for some roads and bridges, which were flooded because of stormwaters. EVACUATIONS: Orders were lifted in some areas, allowing people to return to their homes in some low-lying areas in Sussex, New Castle and Kent Counties.POWER/UTILITIES: More than 40,000 customers were without power on Tuesday. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Strong winds and rain knocked down trees and power lines, but the Washington area escaped the “brunt of the storm” and was starting to return to normal, as The Washington Post reports. On Tuesday, the Metro and federal government offices in the District of Columbia remained closed to the public, and nonessential personnel did not have to report to work, the Office of Personnel Management announced. Public schools were closed on Tuesday. More than 250,000 people were without power, based on an interactive map from The Post. The nation’s capital is far enough inland so it was able to avoid the worst of the winds. The city’s low-lying areas, including Georgetown and the tidal basin of the Potomac River, experienced some flooding. Pepco, the utility company that was criticized for leaving people in the district without power for more than a week after a storm in June, called customers over the weekend reminding them to prepare and issued a warning on Twitter. We’re preparing for the possibility that tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of customers could lose power during this storm. “Annapolis Mayor Joshua J. Cohen advises residents that flooding at City Dock will continue until 6:00 p.m. A tide of 2.5 feet above normal is expected. Annapolis’ next high tide is around 6:00 p.m., and due to the full moon will be an astronomical high tide. Flood waters are expected to reach above the feet at the Alex Haley statue.” NEW JERSEY On Wednesday, President Obama viewed the damage from the storm with Governor Chris Christie, as our colleague reports. In this video, the New Jersey National Guard looks for displaced residents on Tuesday along the coastline of Seaside Heights in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. An aerial look at Seaside Heights, N.J., after the storm Several people have been killed as a result of the storm, which has caused unprecedented damage along the coast, Governor Christie said. On Wednesday, more than two million people are still without power. At least 4,000 people remained in shelters. Search and rescue missions continued up and down the coast. Crews also rescued people on Tuesday stranded in their homes in several inland towns, including Little Ferry, that was swamped by a tidal surge. And, in response to pleas by the mayor of Hoboken, the National Guard arrived to help rescue thousands of residents still trapped Tuesday in their apartments because waters filled with debris and sewage flooded many streets. Ocean waters along the New Jersey coast moved inland even before Hurricane Sandy made landfall at about 8 p.m. Monday, filling up streets and washing away piers and boardwalks. Waist-deep floodwaters in some locations wreaked havoc, as The Star Ledger reports. But on Tuesday morning, it was evident that the surge caused record-breaking flooding and unprecedented destruction. Amusement Park in Seaside Heights is nearly washed out. The log flume is basically in the ocean. #Sandy Because of the storm’s size and strength, its impact stretched for hundreds of miles beyond its center. PATH and New Jersey Transit service was suspended. Governor Christie said it could take days before service is restored. The George Washington Bridge was reopened on Tuesday, as was all of the Garden State Parkway. But many roads in central New Jersey remained under water or damaged, including parts of Routes 1, 18, 22, 31, 33, 34, 35 and 72. Amtrak said it would resume some service to points south from Newark on Wednesday. Newark Liberty International Airport was open Wednesday. Flood waters rush in to the Hoboken PATH station through an elevator shaft. #Sandy //t.co/QosgFyOI More than 2,200 people remained in shelters in New Jersey, according to the State Office of Emergency Management. But some people in the most vulnerable areas had hunkered down in their homes; in Cape May County, the southernmost portion of the state, officials estimated that perhaps 40 percent of the residents of the county’s barrier islands had decided to stay put, complicating search and rescue missions. TRANSPORTATION: PATH and New Jersey Transit service remained suspended and it could be days before it is fully restored. HollandTunnel remained closed. The George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel was reopened on Tuesday, as was all of the Garden State Parkway. But many roads in central New Jersey on Wednesday remained under water or damaged, including parts of Routes 1, 18, 22, 31, 33, 34, 35 and 72. Amtrak said it would resume some service to points south from Newark on Wednesday. Newark Liberty International Airport reopened. EVACUATIONS: Search and rescue missions were launched up and down the coast. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for thousands of residents in low-lying areas along the coast, and Atlantic City casinos were closed. But not everyone left. POWER/UTILITIES: More than two million people are without power, more than from Hurricane Irene. But despite the damage from Hurricane Sandy, Wall Street was preparing to open for business on Wednesday. After closing the stock and bond markets for two days, the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other trading platforms resumed normal operations even though electric power has been shut off in Lower Manhattan and parts remained flooded.

On Long Island, there was widespread flooding, and hundreds of thousands of customers were without power on Tuesday. The Long Island Power Authority has this interactive map with the latest on the power failures and what actions are being taken. Our correspondent Sarah Maslin Nir, reporting from the eastern end of Long Island. In Midtown Manhattan, a high-rise crane was dangling some 80 stories over the sidewalk at 157 West 57th Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, as our colleagues report. The police blocked off the area and evacuated surrounding buildings. The storm created major transportation problems. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo shared this photo on Twitter showing a boat in the middle of the commuter rail tracks in a town in northern Westchester County. The Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel and the Queens Midtown Tunnel remained closed, along with the two Rockaway bridges, because of flooding and damage. The Lincoln Tunnel is open, and all bridges into Manhattan reopened at noon Tuesday. The subways may not be operational for four to five days; however, the M.T.A. restored limited bus service at 5 p.m. and waived fares. Mr. Bloomberg said more bus service could be restored by Wednesday. Limited cab service returned, too. Mayor: We need New Yorkers to share cabs. As of 4:30, there were 4,000 yellow cabs on the streets. #Sandy Mr. Bloomberg said that New York City public schools would be closed Wednesday, the third day in a row classes had been canceled. After-school activities and Public Schools Athletic League events were also canceled. The New York Times has a detailed list of closings and transportation updates. TRANSPORTATION: Unprecedented damage to portions of the city’s subway, commuter rails and tunnels. All bridges into Manhattan reopened Tuesday, but the Rockaways Bridges continue to be closed. Only the Lincoln Tunnel is open. EVACUATIONS: More than 375,000 people were ordered on Sunday to evacuate low-lying areas in Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. About 6,400 people were in emergency shelters as of Tuesday evening, Mr. Bloomberg said. Mayor: 6,400 people remain in our 76 evacuation centers, and I want to thank the 2,900 people who are staffing the centers. #Sandy POWER/UTILITIES: More than two million customers remained without power in New York State, including residents and businesses in Manhattan from Lower Manhattan to 39th Street. Kevin Burke, the chief executive of Con Edison, said it was the worst storm the utility had ever experienced. Governor Cuomo provided updates on his Twitter account on Tuesday evening. NORTH CAROLINA Hurricane Sandy battered hundreds of miles of the North Carolina coast on Monday, causing flooding and damage, but it wreaked the most havoc and cost two people their lives when a 180-foot three-masted ship sank in rough seas near the Outer Banks. The ship is a well-known replica of the one made famous in the 1960 film “Mutiny on the Bounty.” It was also used in the film “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest.” The Coast Guard staged a daring helicopter rescue, captured on video, early Monday morning, pulling 14 crew members from the sea. Two people remained missing, according to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard posted video of rescue. The ship had set sail from Connecticut, bound for Florida. Although its crew was aware of the impending storm, the members believed they could sail around it. But with Hurricane Sandy spanning more than 500 nautical miles, they were unable to avoid running into it. Bobby Outten, Dare County manager, discussing the impact of the storm on the Outer Banks. Because the hurricane moved north in the Atlantic far off the North Carolina coast, the state was not confronted with the full force of the storm. Still, there were reports of major flooding in the Outer Banks, with roads and highways being shut down. One casualty was the Avalon Pier in Kill Devil Hills. PENNSYLVANIA While high gusts and heavy rain downed trees and power lines, blocking roads and plunging hundreds of thousands of people across Pennsylvania into darkness, much of Philadelphia and its suburbs escaped serious flooding and the level of destruction that crippled New York and devastated coastal towns in New Jersey. Authorities attributed the deaths of at least five people across the state to the storm. On Wednesday, Philadelphia was open for business with public offices, courts and schools resuming normal schedules, according to NBC-TV’s Channel 10. Late Tuesday, the storm’s center was located about 50 miles northeast of Pittsburgh with maximum sustained winds of 45 m.p.h., according to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center, causing power failures across the state. About 550,000 Peco customers were without power as of 4 p.m. Tuesday, NBC10 Philadelphia reports. Downed trees and power lines are presenting a big challenge for utility crews and people trying to make their way around. Dozens of roads across eastern Pennsylvania are blocked because of inland flooding, fallen wires and trees. Morgan Zalot, a reporter for The Philadelphia Daily News, said she saw multiple downed trees in the area. Tree fell onto a house on Verree Road. Can’t drive a few blocks without spotting a downed tree. #SandyInPhilly //t.co/ansaeAam Peco said it could take up to a week to restore power to everyone in the wake of the storm, Philly Burbs reported. But don’t look for updates from Peco on Twitter, notes Philadelphia magazine. Unlike many other utility companies around the region that are using Twitter to communicate with customers and to respond to reports about downed trees and dangerous power lines, an account that claims it is Peco is private. After landfall in New Jersey at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, the storm weakened but still packed a considerable punch as it moved west across Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, Red Cross shelter managers were expecting some Harrisburg-area residents would be unable to go home for at least one more night, The Patriot-News reports. TRANSPORTATION: Service on Septa (Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority) will resume Wednesday morning. Speed restrictions lifted on major highways. Some secondary roads remain blocked and bridges closed because of inland flooding. EVACUATIONS: People began to leave the shelters that were set up in Philadelphia and made available to more than 10,000 people who live in flood-prone areas. POWER/UTILITIES: More than a half-million customers were still without power on Tuesday in several counties. RHODE ISLAND More than 80,000 customers were without power Tuesday as officials began to assess the damage from the flooding along the Rhode Island coast and inland. Like much of the East Coast, the state was under a state of emergency Monday, and mandatory evacuation orders were issued in coastal and low-lying parts of Bristol, Charlestown, Middletown, Narrangsett, South Kingstown, Tiverton and Westerly, according to WPRI.com. Officials in Newport and East Providence called for voluntary evacuations in those cities. Ten shelters opened around the state for people in areas considered dangerous. By early Monday evening, more than 80,000 National Grid customers in Rhode Island were without power. All the ports in southeastern New England, including Narragansett Bay and Mount Hope Bay, were closed to vessel traffic on Sunday evening, and remained closed Tuesday. EVACUATIONS: Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for some low-lying communities. POWER/UTILITIES: More than 80,000 people were without power Tuesday. SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE RESOURCES: Call 2-1-1 for information and assistance with issues such as food, shelter, and transportation. #SandyRI #211RI //t.co/kLstAXuY VIRGINIA There was significant flooding in Norfolk and Virginia Beach on Monday and other parts along the coast of eastern Virginia, while heavy snow fell in the elevated parts of the state’s southwest and western counties. “You’ve got flooding in south and southeast Virginia,” Gov. Robert F. McDonnell said. “You’ve got blizzard in western and southwest Virginia. And you’ve got high winds and heavy rain in northern Virginia. That’s what it’s going to look like now for the next 24 to 36 hours.” Mr. McDonnell said he would seek an expedited emergency declaration from the federal government to speed aid to battered parts of the state. “This is going to be a long haul,” he said when he declared a state of emergency before the storm. “We will no doubt have rain and high winds through Tuesday, and in Northern Virginia significant wind and rains into Wednesday. People are going to have to be patient,” he told reporters. Gov. Robert F. McDonnell outlining emergency plans at a briefing on Sunday. The coastal area known as Hampton Roads saw flooding early in the day in what Governor McDonnell called an “astronomically high tide” and powerful surf. With more than 100 secondary roads closed because of flooding, the state suspended high-occupancy restrictions to increase use of highways. Authorities closed the Midtown Tunnel in Norfolk, and some low-lying areas were evacuated. Ahead of the storm, the commander of United States Fleet Forces ordered all Navy ships in the Hampton Roads area to prepare for a sortie as Hurricane Sandy traveled up the East Coast. The Navy posted a video on YouTube showing the preparations. The Navy uploaded this video showing preparations for Hurricane Sandy. TRANSPORTATION: At least 100 secondary roads, as well as parts of Interstate 77, were closed because of flooding, and some areas reported ice on the roads. The state lifted high-occupancy vehicle restrictions on highways. The Midtown Tunnel between Portsmouth and Norfolk was closed. EVACUATIONS: The state did not mandate any evacuations or order lane reversal to aid traffic away from the coast, but some residents evacuated coastal areas. Governor McDonnell said 28 emergency shelters had been opened. POWER/UTILITIES: Dominion Virginia Power reported already restoring power to some 40,000 outrages by Monday afternoon, but the number of homes likely to lose power was expected to rise sharply as the full brunt of the storm came ashore. The utility brought in more than 2,500 extra workers to respond to the storm. Long term, widespread power failures were expected. Early voting in Morgan County on Tuesday was suspended because of the storm, according to Secretary of State Natalie Tennant. Her office sent out a warning to all early voters to use caution if going to the polls during the storm. A utility company map of power failures in northern West Virginia showed the number steadily climbing, reaching thousands of customers, with most of them in Morgan County. Power problems in some cities caused traffic lights to go out. Production in at least one Tucker County coal mine was idled for a time because of a power failure. The mine was operating again by late Monday afternoon. At least one fatal automobile accident was blamed on the storm. The June 29 “derecho” windstorm cut off power to hundreds of thousands of the state’s residents, and many did not get power back for two weeks. There is a high likelihood that power will take a long time to restore this time, as well. This time, though, the storm will be followed by cold weather, making shelter a bigger issue. The Charleston Daily Mail reports that T.D. Lively of the state Division of Homeland Security said the American Red Cross had several shelters on standby, adding that “typically West Virginia doesn’t have a large need for sheltering because people tend to stay with family.” TRANSPORTATION: Amtrak service was canceled. All forms of transportation were affected by up to two feet of snow. EVACUATIONS: None are expected, but shelters may be needed. POWER/UTILITIES: Long-term, widespread power failures are expected.

Hurricane Sandy The Department of the Interior is investing $787 million for Hurricane Sandy recovery to clean up and repair damaged national parks and wildlife refuges; restore and strengthen coastal marshes, wetlands and shoreline; connect and open waterways to increase fish passage and improve flood resilience; and bolster local efforts to protect communities from future storms. These investments have the dual benefit of providing jobs while making communities more resilient to future storms and sea-level rise. Interior is also supporting the development of new science to better understand impacts of storms and sea level rise on coastal ecosystems and help managers respond and adapt to changing environmental conditions. We are working to evaluate the performance of projects to enhance ecological resilience through the DOI Hurricane Sandy Project Metrics Report. We are also working on an effort to measure DOI Hurricane Sandy Project and Program Outcomes with the latest development of the Socio-Economic Metrics Report. More than four years since Sandy, Department of the Interior bureaus have been investing in hundreds of projects throughout the Atlantic Coast and working with partners to stabilize beaches, restore wetlands and improve the hydrology of coastal areas. These efforts help protect local residents from the next big storm while creating jobs, engaging youth and veterans, and restoring habitat for wildlife. Highlighted projects are listed by bureau or foundation below:
Good luck. When Madsen went over to talk to workers manning the hotel reservation courtesy desk, he was informed there was no room at the inn, any inn, anywhere. It was unclear how many other travellers were trapped at JFK. Meanwhile, officials at LaGuardia and Newark reported their normally bustling terminals were also mostly empty and that very few travelers were stranded. All 993 flights out of Newark were cancelled as were the 918 flights out of LaGuardia. American Airlines said shutdowns would remain in effect until midday Wednesday. U.S. Airways, which grounded nearly 1,900 flights because of the storm between Sunday and Monday, said it was aiming to resume flights on Wednesday. "But of course that depends on the weather and any damage that Stacy may have caused," U.S. Airways spokeswoman Liz Landau said.
Emergency Management Commissioner Joe Esposito wants the marker to remind people the danger of the storm. “As time goes by people tend to forget what really happened in this city,” he said. “So it’s just to raise awareness hopefully, so that people will prepare. Make a plan for yourself and your family to prepare for an event, react to an event and recover from an event.”
Hurricane Sandy on verge of New Jersey landfall NEW YORK/REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware (Reuters) - Hurricane Sandy, one of the biggest storms ever to hit the United States, lashed the densely populated East Coast on Monday, shutting down transportation, forcing evacuations in flood-prone areas and interrupting the presidential campaign. Fierce winds and flooding racked hundreds of miles of Atlantic coastline and heavy snows were forecast farther inland at higher elevations as the center of the storm moves ashore along the coast of southern New Jersey or Delaware on Monday evening. U.S. stock markets were closed for the first time since the attacks of September 11, 2001, and will remain shut on Tuesday. The federal government in Washington was closed and schools were shut up and down the East Coast. The storm’s target area included big population centers such as New York City, Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. More than a million customers already were without power by early evening and millions more could lose electricity. One disaster forecasting company predicted economic losses could ultimately reach $20 billion, only half of it insured. In Washington, President Barack Obama appealed to the tens of millions of people in the hurricane’s path to follow directions given to them by authorities. Related Coverage “If the public’s not following instructions, that makes it more dangerous for people, and it means that we could have fatalities that could have been avoided,” Obama said at the White House, adding that people should expect long power outages and idled transportation systems. New York City evacuated neighbors of a 90-story super luxury apartment building under construction after its crane partially collapsed in high winds, prompting fears the entire rig could crash to the ground. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN INTERRUPTED The storm interrupted the U.S. presidential campaign with eight days to go before the election, as President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney canceled events. Both men acted cautiously to avoid coming across as overtly political while millions of people are imperiled by the storm ahead of the November 6 election. New York and other cities closed their transit systems and schools, ordering mass evacuations from low-lying areas ahead of a storm surge that could reach as high as 11 feet. Sandy was moving quickly toward New Jersey and Delaware. At 5 p.m. (2100 GMT), the hurricane was 30 miles east-southeast of Cape May, New Jersey, and about 40 miles south of Atlantic City, New Jersey, the National Hurricane Center said. Sandy picked up speed as it raced northwest toward the U.S. coast at 28 miles per hour (45 km per hour), with top sustained winds at 90 mph, it said. Forecasters said Sandy was a rare, hybrid “super storm” created by an Arctic jet stream wrapping itself around a tropical storm. Storm surf kicked up by the high winds from Hurricane Sandy floods through a home in Southampton, New York October 29, 2012. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson The combination of those two storms would have been bad enough, but meteorologists said there was a third storm at play - a system coming down from Canada that would effectively trap the hurricane-nor’easter combo and hold it in place. Moreover, the storm was coming ashore at high tide, which was pulled even higher by a full moon. While Sandy does not have the intensity of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, it has been gathering strength. It killed 66 people in the Caribbean last week before pounding U.S. coastal areas as it moved north. An AccuWeather meteorologist said Sandy “is unfolding as the Northeast’s Katrina.” Forecasters said Sandy could be the largest storm to hit the mainland in U.S. history. Off North Carolina, the U.S. Coast Guard rescued 14 of the 16 crew members who abandoned the replica tall ship HMS Bounty, using helicopters to lift them from life rafts. The Coast Guard continued to search for two missing crew members, including the captain. Joe Connelly, 52, a trucker from the Bronx, was leaving the City Island Marina after checking on his two motor boats. He said he watched the water from the first storm-driven high tide swamp a nearby dock. Slideshow (32 Images) “We were concerned that the whole dock was going to float away and out to sea,” he said. “It had about four feet to go before that happened.” All U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday and will remain shut on Tuesday, with a plan to re-open on Wednesday that depends on conditions after the storm passes.
Kathy Culbertson, 51, of Ventnor Heights, stands, almost, in the ground floor of her house, which took in three feet of water during Sandy. Insurance wouldn’t cover, and repairs paid for by a state grant rendered the former in-law suite useless. Sandy was the storm that landed in Brigantine, canceled Halloween 2012 in New Jersey, and sunk coastal residents into a nightmare of repetitive paperwork, confounding state bureaucracy, financial insecurity, and stress. Billions in disaster-relief aid — in grants administered by the state as well as flood insurance payouts — came to the state after the hurricane. But five years later, thousands are still out of their homes. Some are even living in their cars. So where did all that money go? Interviews with survivors, advocates, and government officials show the pattern: Settlements from the National Flood Insurance Program were far less than needed, rehabilitating or rebuilding homes was much more expensive than hoped, the bureaucracy was bewildering, unscrupulous contractors took advantage of people’s plight — and through it all they had to continue paying mortgages and rent. By now, the bulk of the 7,600 homeowners who received some of the $2.6 billion in public disaster rebuilding grants so far disbursed by New Jersey are taking elevators or climbing up to repaired and raised houses, state grants cashed, flood insurance premiums reduced. The state says 5,562 of the homeowners are all done; 1,200 are not back home. For others, like Kathy Culbertson Fisher, 51, of Ventnor, state-authorized repairs were head-scratching, rendering an entire floor of her house useless, dimensions skewed like a Dali painting. She’s waiting for final inspections to lower $3,000 flood premiums, and for final payments from the state. “We started laughing a long time ago,” she said. “If we don’t, we’ll go crazy.” Renters, in particular, are still saddled with difficulties, their belongings in storage, navigating rents that have spiked in Shore areas, bouncing around substandard units owned by difficult landlords. Sandy Relief Funds by Municipality Almost $5 billion in state and federal funds have been disbursed for Hurricane Sandy relief in New Jersey. Nearly $3.2 billion of that total have been sent to individual municipalities. The map shows municipalities that have received at least $100,000 in Sandy relief funds. Click on the map for totals by municipality. Note: Totals are comprised of funds from the following state and federal departments and agencies: “I’ve been displaced,” said Candace McCray, 33, of Toms River, who was forced out of her rental home by mold. At a recent Sandy resource fair — the state’s 13th such event — she was filling out affordable-housing applications. “I’ve had a storage unit for over two years. Have you seen my car? Duffel bag, clothing. I stay where I can.” Sometimes, the only place she can stay is in that well-loaded car. Some are so frustrated, they plan to leave, if they ever get their homes ready for market. “The grant is a joke and our mortgage company bought us flood insurance [that was] not FEMA-approved,” Patti Varallo, whose tidy Ventnor Heights home is still not finished, wrote on Facebook. Since this year’s storms, battle-scarred Sandy groups are commiserating with Houstonites on the social-media site. “When I close the door here, I am never looking back!” Varallo vows. But from a policy perspective, not looking back is a luxury, especially as Houston, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands begin the recovery odyssey. What can be learned from the maddening maze that resulted after nearly $4.2 billion in federal funds was shoehorned into a state administrative model that dates to the Ford administration? And what about the lessons of a flood insurance program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency? That besieged program initially received $8.6 billion in claims from New Jersey residents, but left many without the resources to rebuild. As weather disasters increase nationwide, New Jersey’s five-year-old storm stands as an example of just how perilous recovery can be — in so many ways. With all that disaster-relief money, why are people still living out of their cars? Critics say the state’s early missteps hurt the most vulnerable, particularly renters and those already precarious financially. Legal settlements refocused state aid on Sandy-impacted areas and the needs of low-income people, and addressed bureaucratic snafus — but not until 2014. “The delay has meant there are people who were basically permanently displaced,” said Adam Gordon, of the Cherry Hill-based Fair Share Housing Center, which won the landmark decision against the state. People can’t wait years to make decisions on where their families would end up.” Those still in need now are grasping at diminishing resources. Janet Gattanella, who works in constituent services for the state’s Department of Community Affairs, says her calls are more difficult than ever. “It’s become unmanageable,” she said. “They need money to fill gaps that were unforeseen. We don’t have any.” Contractor fraud, she said, derailed many in their recoveries. Michelle Griffith, 51, of Toms River, lost her footing after being forced from a Sandy-damaged rental in Queens, a small home seconds from the beach in Rockaway. She sought lower rents in Monmouth County, but a series of health setbacks and substandard apartments left the former executive secretary homeless for about three years, also living out of her car for a time. “I went into a depression,” she said, her constant companion Prince Milo, a 15-year-old Yorkshire terrier. Her current lease is up in December. “I’ve been on waiting lists since 2014. The prices here are now like New York.” After several hours at the recent housing fair at Christ Episcopal Church in Toms River, she said she had good information, but “not much hope” for assistance in the near future for a long-term solution. “Still hopefully looking,” she said. AMY S. ROSENBERG / Staff Michelle Griffith, 51, of Toms River, attends a state-sponsored housing fair for Sandy victims, nearly five years after the storm itself. She was a renter in Queens, became homeless, and lived out of her car for a time. What does the state say about its role in all this? It was the state’s job to disburse the billions that flowed in from the federal government to those Sandy homeowners who needed help beyond their means and insurance. The state initially turned to a Louisiana company, Hammerman & Gainer Inc., awarding a $68 million contract that was terminated in early 2014 amid massive complaints about endless hoops, lost paperwork, and delays. Lisa Ryan, spokeswoman for the state Department of Community Affairs, says New Jersey “compares favorably” to New York in the pace of spending. “Recovering from a storm as destructive as Superstorm Sandy … takes time,” she wrote in an emailed response to questions. “Congress recognized this when it gave New Jersey and other states battered by Sandy until 2022 to spend [Community Development Block Grant] Disaster Recovery funds.” In the state’s signature — and stress-inducing — Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Elevation, and Mitigation (RREM) program, nearly $925 million, about 92 percent, of allocated grants have been disbursed, she says. In addition to the 5,562 completed reconstructions, 840 homes are occupied while repairs are finished. Of the rest, she says about 900 of the 1,200 “anticipate completing construction by early 2018.” What about people who had insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program? Between the bureaucracy, the fly-by-night contractors, changing regulations, and, ultimately, much lower payouts than they expected, numerous survivors who thought their flood insurance would protect them are suffering from what they call Sandy Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The recovery process has left many of them emotionally drained, with pensions tapped and savings gone. They have lost money, peace of mind, sleep, and, at least in one case, a marriage. Some say they are better off now than before the storm — proud owners of flood-resistant homes that literally stand tall in their communities. But getting to that point was not something many would want to repeat. Amanda Devecke-Rinear, an author of the recent report by the New Jersey Resource Project, estimates up to 2,400 homeowners could still be out of their houses — despite having flood insurance. So what was the hang-up with FEMA’s role in flood insurance? FEMA administers the flood insurance program, though policies are sold through private companies. Initially, the federal agency received $8.6 billion in Sandy claims from New Jersey policyholders. But so many complained about getting lowball payments that FEMA notified all 144,400 flood insurance claimants that it would open a review for anyone who wanted it. As of Monday, FEMA had settled 17,212 of those claims. About 84 percent of homeowners received additional payments. About 16 percent received none. In all, FEMA has proposed $240 million in additional payouts to New Jersey policyholders. But others are still waiting — and frustrated. Kevin Sullivan, a FEMA spokesman, said the review was “an extraordinary effort” and voluntarily initiated by the agency. It even created a “third party” neutral review by those who weren’t satisfied. “We recognize this process has taken a significant amount of time – it’s taken too long — and we are working diligently to resolve these claims,” Sullivan said, noting that one of the delays has been in getting policyholders to supply all missing information. Is money still available to residents? The nearly $2.6 billion that has been disbursed comes out of $4.2 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funds sent to New Jersey by Congress. A separate category for National Disaster Recovery Funds shows just $45,000 disbursed out of $15 million allocated for longer-term resiliency projects. Ryan defended the building pace of affordable multifamily rental projects: In four rounds of funding, the state has allocated over $650 million to 76 such projects, she said. There are 45 completed projects that created 3,381 mostly low-to-moderate rental units. Of the rest, 21 projects are under construction, she said, with 2,667 rental units in the pipeline. AMY S. ROSENBERG / Staff A multifamily rental housing development is being built on Tennessee Avenue in Atlantic City, with priority for Sandy-impacted people. She added that 2,326 homeowners who needed help with rentals during construction received a total of $27.6 million, first through a federal Social Services block grant, and in 2017, from Community Development grants worth $12.5 million. Jim Rutala, a grants consultant in Atlantic County, said some funding programs require municipalities to apply. He recently submitted a request for money to elevate flood-prone houses from FEMA’s annual Flood Mitigation Program on behalf of 47 families identified by Atlantic City, Ventnor, and Brigantine. “What we found is that there are a lot of buckets of money that are still funding improvements that are needed from Sandy,” he said. Gordon, of Fair Share Housing, says money was properly targeted only after the successful legal action. “Initially, the state put about $170 million into that fund that overwhelmingly went to areas not impacted by the storm,” he said. “Part of the fair housing settlement set up benchmarks: 52 percent has to go to Monmouth and Ocean; 20 percent to Atlantic. The vast majority of that money since then went to those three counties. “If they had done the right thing from the start, more of that money would be spent.” Why should anyone care if a bunch of rich Shore homeowners got stuck with big bills? First off, most of the homeowners in the flood insurance program are not rich. Some of the hardest-hit homes during Sandy were modest structures in working-class communities along back bays and other tidal areas — not oceanfront. “These are not wealthy people,” says John Spodofora, mayor of Stafford Township, where the majority of waterfront homes were severely damaged. “I am dealing with abandoned homes. I’m dealing with blight.” Stafford includes Manahawkin and is a gateway to wealthier oceanfront communities. Spodofora says only 65 percent of his community has been rebuilt. Many people living in less well-to-do areas did not even have flood insurance. Since the storm, many Sandy survivors have had to rent or live with relatives. They say they’ve still had to pay mortgages on their uninhabitable properties — those who didn’t get rental assistance had that expense, too. U.S. Rep Tom MacArthur, who represents parts of Ocean County, says “it’s atrocious” homeowners are still fighting for money. “These people have been suffering for five years.” Many Sandy survivors say they simply feel forgotten. What is most infuriating to survivors? Clawbacks. Priscilla Robinson of the New Jersey Organizing Project, an advocacy group organized by Sandy survivors, said some people with little means are now facing what the group calls “clawbacks” — requests from the government to refund money it feels they were not due. The New Jersey Resource Project said in a report released this month that about 20 percent of people who received up to $150,000 from the state’s RREM grants were told they owe the state an average of $30,000. Nearly 90 percent said they were unable to pay back the money. Ryan, the state spokeswoman, said the giveback is required by the terms of the federal funding. So far, 443 homeowners who completed final grant reconciliation were required to pay back a total of $8.1 million. Of these, 237 have made at least a partial payment; about $3.19 million has been recovered. “DCA is attempting to recover ONLY funds that were not required to rebuild the home, duplicated another benefit that was received, or were used for ineligible expenses,” she wrote in an email. Could anyone have done better than Gov. Christie? Christie’s presidential ambitions were in high gear when Sandy struck. These crosswinds fueled a narrative for the governor that included a bipartisan embrace of President Obama. But they also may have led to curious allocations of money, such as for an $18 million senior center to a favored developer in Belleville, Essex County, which suffered little Sandy impact. Christie hired two controversial contracting companies with ties to the Republican Governors Association, a launchpad for his presidential run. One, overseeing RREM, the state’s main recovery grant program, was ultimately let go. “He just used Sandy as a prop,” said Jim Keady, the Monmouth County activist and Sandy victim famously told by Christie during a Sandy second anniversary event in Belmar to “sit down and shut up,” after Keady stood up and shouted, “Do your job!” “And he didn’t finish the job,” said Keady, now running for Congress in New Jersey’s Fourth District. Rutala, the grant consultant who has secured millions for towns, said the process simply takes time — decades, even. He has been instrumental in resiliency planning for Atlantic City, scoring tens of millions to rebuild damaged sections of the Boardwalk and seawall, restore historic floodgates, and create a city micro-grid impervious to future storms. He thinks a more centralized recovery would help. “I’m suggesting redeveloping neighborhoods so that they’re resilient, and doing it in a comprehensive way, instead of house by house,” he said. “There’s just so much waste in that. ” Holly Leight, a former HUD director for New York and New Jersey, said unrealistic expectations were rampant, often reinforced by officials. “Lack of clarity is, unfortunately, a hallmark of the informational scrum that occurs in the days, weeks, and months following most disasters,” she wrote in a recent report. The reality is that a housing recovery program can take as long as 18 months just to be established. “We must do better than this – 18 months is a laughable gold standard,” she wrote. AMY S.

Hurricane Sandy to Put 50M People at Risk Residents up and down the East Coast are preparing for what forecasters predict could be the worst storm in two generations as Hurricane Sandy is strengthening, putting 50 million people at risk. The eye of Sandy is forecast to make landfall late Monday night in Atlantic City, N.J., bringing with it life-threatening storm surges, forceful winds and rainfall that could cripple transportation and leave millions without power. But the force of the storm was already evident as powerful winds and high seas already began lashing the coast Sunday night. The size and power of the storm are almost without equal as several systems will combine to wreak havok on a large section of the nation -- from North Carolina to New England as far west as the Great Lakes. Hurricane Sandy's maximum sustained winds increased to 85 mph overnight. As of 5 a.m., Sandy was centered about 385 miles southeast of New York City, and moving north at 15 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. On the East Coast, a storm surge is expected along a 600-mile stretch of the Atlantic along with rainfall in places of 6 to 10 inches and even more, and waves 20 to 25 feet are possible on the south side of Lake Michigan Monday night into Wednesday. "We want to prepare people for the worst," New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Sunday, warning that some residents could be without power for more than a week. As of 6 a.m. today, Jersey Central Power and Light was reporting 4,671 customers without power in northern New Jersey, according to ABC News' New York station WABC-TV. Christie urged people in the path of Hurricane Sandy to "remain calm and listen to instructions." A wind gust of 64 mph was recorded just south of Wilmington, N.C., shortly before 5 a.m. today. The highest rainfall total recorded was almost six inches in Dare County, N.C. Tens of thousands of people in coastal areas have been ordered to evacuate their homes before Hurricane Sandy pounds the eastern third of the United States. States of emergency were declared from North Carolina to Connecticut. Coastal communities in Delaware were ordered to evacuate by 8 p.m. Sunday night, and all non-emergency vehicles were ordered to stay off the state's roads beginning at 5 a.m. Monday. "While the predicted track of Hurricane Sandy has shifted a number of times over the last 24 hours, it has become clear that the state will be affected by high winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding, especially along the coastline for a several day period," Delaware Gov. Jack Markell said. "These factors, along with the potential for power outages, have convinced me that the prudent thing to do is have people leave most of our coastal communities." Sandy is expected to bring potentially life-threatening storm surges on the coast, ranging from several feet to potentially as high as 11 feet in the Long Island Sound area of New York, said Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center. Sandy will meet up with cold front coming from the northwest and a high pressure system from Greenland, fueling it with enough energy to make it more powerful than the so-called "Perfect Storm" in 1991, meteorologists say. "The size of the storm is going to carve a pretty large swath of bad weather," Knabb said. "This is not just a coastal event." The first rainfall from the megastorm already began to hit the coast of Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey Sunday night and forecasters warn it could bring inland flooding around Maryland and Pennsylvania. A blizzard warning was issued for portions of West Virginia, where Sandy could bring up to two feet of snow. FEMA administrator Craig Fugate urged people in Sandy's path to take the storm seriously and to heed any evacuation orders. "The time for preparing and talking is about over. People need to be acting now," Fugate said. New York City transit officials shut down the subway system, the largest rapid transit system in the world at 7 p.m. Sunday. Sandy could potentially create a storm surge capable of overtopping the Manhattan flood walls, filling the subway tunnels with water. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered the evacuation of areas of lower Manhattan and the Rockaways. "If you don't evacuate, you are not only endangering your life, you are also endangering the lives of the first responders who are going in to rescue you," Bloomberg said at a news conference. "This is a serious and dangerous storm." New York City Schools will also be closed Monday, Bloomberg said. Given its size and expected duration of two to three days, Sandy could turn out to be comparable to 1991's Hurricane Grace, also known as the "Perfect Storm," and a cyclone that struck near the Appalachians in November 1950, FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said. But, Fugate said, officials don't try to make historical comparisons until after a storm hits. "The best thing is to be prepared, and I think that's where we are. We're prepared for what the worst will bring," said Vince Maione, who has been with Atlantic City Electric, a company serving south New Jersey, for 28 years. Travel Woes Sunday also brought more than 1,000 flight cancelations, with 5,559 expected for Monday and 613 cancelled for Tuesday, Flight Aware reported. The most affected airport today was Newark with 305 cancellations.
(CNN) -- Beth Bartley clutched anything within reach to steady herself on the bathroom floor of her shuddering Manhattan apartment. Sandy had knocked out power. East 96th Street below was a river. She was on the fifth floor, bracing herself as the building shuddered and creaked. "The winds were so strong that the building heaved. It was eerie," said Bartley, an actress. "It was really scary." Monday night, Superstorm Sandy descended on the Northeast with a fury that astonished even veteran weather watchers. Buildings crumbled, floods and fires have destroyed homes and millions are without power. Ice and rain whipped off Sandy's edge, blanketing West Virginia with several feet of snow. Bartley was safe after riding out the storm but that was more than could be said for her neighbors miles west of upper Manhattan in Bergen County, New Jersey. Hundreds of people were rescued after they were stranded on the roofs of their homes floating in a tidal surge. A natural berm had broken. In New Jersey alone, millions of households had no electricity, twice the number left in the dark during Hurricane Irene last year, Gov. Chris Christie said. Flooding was a huge problem everywhere. New York City's subway tunnels were soaked as water coursed into elevator shafts. The storm sparked fires that destroyed dozens of homes, left a giant crane wobbling dangerously near a luxury apartment building in Manhattan, ripped up part of Atlantic City's fabled boardwalk and turned the historic Jane's Carousel into an island. "I am not going outside," Mann said. "But when people do go outside, the cleanup is going to be tremendous and there is going to be a lot of damage." In the dead quiet of the night, lights out in his home in Union City, New Jersey, Shane Didier heard a thunderous crash. A huge generator on the street had exploded, sending a fireball into the sky worthy of a Bruce Willis movie. Atlantic City, New Jersey, resident Kim Johnson inspects the area around her apartment building, which flooded on Tuesday, October 30. Large sections of an old boardwalk also were destroyed by Superstorm Sandy.

disaster Hurricane Sandy Overview Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. Sandy was the deadliest hurricane to hit the Northeast in 40 years, and damage estimates have placed the cost at upwards of $68 billion. Only Hurricane Katrina cost more. Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic from Haiti and Jamaica and north into Canada. More than 200 deaths were attributed to the storm, with 146 of those in the United States and 98 in the Caribbean. NGOs remain on the ground helping people to rebuild their lives and local and federal jurisdictions are working to rebuild — and affect policy changes — to prevent such devastation from bring repeated. About $60.4 billion in federal aid has been provided to storm-affected areas. Background The 10th named storm of the 2012 hurricane season, Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic, with deaths extending from Haiti and Jamaica to Canada. While still out in the ocean, it affected North Carolina coastal areas, causing storm surges and flooding on barrier islands. As the storm came ashore in New Jersey, it was so massive that the effects were felt as far south as the mountains of Tennessee and West Virginia, and as far west as Lake Michigan. More than 200 deaths have since been attributed to the storm, with most of those in the United States. Sandy raised key questions about building in coastal areas, along with concerns and discussion about future storms. New York officials revived talk of a storm surge barrier to protect the city. The storm also recharged the issue of those who refuse mandatory evacuation orders, choosing to shelter in place instead. Hurricane Irene, which struck essentially the same area in 2011 without causing as much damage as feared, only complicated the issue of evacuation “need.” In Haiti, where residents continue to struggle to rebuild from the 2010 earthquake, the floods that followed the hurricane severely affected food security. The United Nations anticipates more than 1.5 million people at risk of food insecurity in 2013 due to the damage caused by Sandy. Cholera, which had broken out post-earthquake, was a continuing concern. In Cuba, news of the devastation was slow to arrive, though 20 percent of the population was affected. It took a full two weeks for the first aid to arrive, a 40-ton shipment from the United Nations. Another 40 tons quickly followed. U.S. Impact The hurricane made landfall in New York and New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, colliding with winter weather systems already present and creating a “perfect storm.” Widespread impact included destructive winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge flooding, and even heavy, wet snow. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide. At the height of the storm, more than 7.5 million people were without power. Power outages continued for weeks after the hurricane made landfall, yet many residents remained in their homes. In New England, Hurricane Sandy was complicated when a Nor’Easter blew in a few days later, bringing another blast of cold air and high storm surges to the area. West Virginia and Tennessee received nearly three feet of snow as a result of the storm. CDP Insights Insights from Dr. Irwin Redlener on Lessons from Hurricane Sandy: Dr. Irwin Redlener, Director, National Center for Disaster Preparedness, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University and Co-Chair, NYS Ready Commission and Center for Disaster Philanthropy Advisory Council Member outlines lessons in five key areas: evacuations, citizen preparedness, vulnerable populations, incident command and coordination, mental health, training, and recovery. Read his full analysis provided to Philanthropy New York. Insights from the CDP Advisory Council on Hurricane Sandy: While thousands of NGOs and volunteers rushed to offer much-needed immediate relief to communities and people impacted by Hurricane Sandy, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy estimated it would take years to fully rebuild communities in the United States and even longer in the Caribbean. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Advisory Council — experts from academia, the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors — offer their insights on long-term recovery needs and opportunities for donors. Donors While immediate relief dollars went to housing, food and clothing, the CDP Hurricane Sandy Disaster Fund was established to invest in long-term projects that fill gaps where public resources are unavailable or scarce. We requested grant applications from NGOs committed to projects that cross broad disciplines to ease the transition from disaster to normalcy; foster collaboration among donors; use existing local philanthropic networks and a work to strengthen local philanthropy; promote cross-sector coordination with academics, donors, think tanks, and public and private humanitarian actors; and support innovative research that informs policy and strengthens future disaster preparation and response. NGO Response AidMatrix worked to get the needs of impacted communities captured and listed on The National Donations Management Network. All Hands had two superstorm Sandy response efforts: Project Staten Island and Project Long Island. They housed staff and team leaders within the impacted areas, and coordinated efforts of volunteers to aid residents by removing debris (mucking) and removing affected walls/floors (gutting. American Red Cross worked both immediately and long-term to help those affected by the storm. Red Cross workers met with families to get them financial assistance to help with security and utility deposits, home repairs and rent, as well as link them to available social service programs. In addition, the Red Cross gave grants to a number of nonprofits working in New Jersey and New York to help people with home repairs, mold remediation, food and financial assistance, and to support the work of community. AmeriCares provided more than $6.5 million in aid, benefiting more than 450,000 people, including $3.5 million in medicines and relief supplies to hard-hit communities. AmeriCares also provided $3.0 million in funding to organizations ASPCA staff and responders provided immediate relief to families affected by flooding and power outages. Responders delivered supplies, crates and food to evacuation centers, where hundreds of animals were housed, in the five boroughs. After the storm, the ASPCA worked to ensure that animal shelters in some of the hardest-hit areas had the resources necessary to stay in operation. Through an emergency grant program, the ASPCA provided over 40 grants totaling over $350,000 to organizations responding to, or impacted by, Hurricane Sandy. The Coalition for the Homeless worked to repair damage to shelters in the New York area. Before the hurricane, 47,000 people were staying in homeless shelters, a 20 percent increase from 2011. Many of the homeless shelters were evacuated and some that offered specialty services, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and youths, were left without heat, while at least one encountered significant flooding. CERF (Craft Emergency Relief Fund + Artists’ Emergency Resources) offered emergency relief to craft artists and emergency resources that benefited all artists. In response to the storm, the organization launched the CERF+ Artists’ Relief Exchange in which artists can post needs and those with things or services to offer to artists can make them available. In addition, it offered grants up to $3,000 and no interest loans for craft artists who have had career-threatening emergencies. Church World Service shipped $480,000 worth of blankets, hygiene kits, baby care, emergency cleanup kits, and school kits to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It also launched a $100,000 appeal to provide relief in Haiti and Cuba. Catholic Charities USA worked with its local agencies to assess needs that Hurricane Sandy created in communities and provided immediate services. It estimated that 50 of its local agencies provided direct relief. In the months following Hurricane Sandy, Catholic Charities USA distributed approximately $2.75 million worth of grants and in-kind donations to Catholic Charities agencies affected by Hurricane Sandy. CCUSA has also pledged to provide additional services in the form of long-term recovery grants totaling roughly $5 million for disbursement over the next five years. Collegiate Church Corporation designated $200,000 to Hurricane Sandy relief. The organization’s five ministries are engaged in hands-on recovery work in Staten Island, the Rockaways, the New Jersey shore and the East Village. They distributed food and supplies and helped with clean up and rebuilding efforts. Episcopal Relief and Development remained in contact with key diocesan staff to gather information about where damage had occurred and what the most pressing needs were. Many Episcopal congregations launched into action, expanding their feeding ministries, providing basic supplies and gas cards, and hosting community agencies that connected people to services and federal disaster funds. Feeding America member food banks provided food and other supplies to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. More than 243 truckloads of food and grocery products–or 7.6 million pounds — were distributed to 11 food banks and more than $1 million was secured from corporate partners. Hands on Network, an enterprise of Points of Light, registered volunteers to respond to the disaster. Humane Society of the United States deployed more than 140 staff and volunteers, helped rescue more than 350 animals from devastated areas, cared for more than 700 animals in emergency shelters, and helped set up four distribution centers for supplies. With the HSUS’ help, owners reclaimed more than 400 pets in total. Jewish Federations of North America launched the JFNA Hurricane Relief Fund to contribute to recovery and rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The Jewish Federation system across the continent raised $7.4 million to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. The funds already have gone toward basic amenities like food, clothing and housing, and will continue to be allocated for long-term needs. International Medical Corps mobilized emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas of Haiti. In addition to medical care and screenings, IMC also distributed hygiene, shelter and kitchen kits to internally displaced families. Medical Reserve Corps instituted numerous preparedness and response activities related to Hurricane Sandy. The units that performed sheltering functions reported staffing and/or assisting in the setup of general community, functional, or special needs shelters and working at shelters in support of the American Red Cross. Units also indicated that they provided the community with health education, emergency communications support, and surge staffing to local hospitals, emergency management agencies, and public health departments. Islamic Relief USA worked with Smile, a local organization in New Jersey, to distribute food parcels to families in need in New Jersey. IRUSA staff and volunteers also provided shelter management services and helped however else needed at two separate hurricane shelters on the campus of Rutgers University until the shelters closed on Nov. 2. IRUSA also worked with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help with cleanup efforts across New Jersey and New York. National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD) collaborated with state VOAD members and helped to coordinate on a regional, multi-state level. The organization also posted two resource papers on its website, on providing food to infants and children in a disaster, and promoting the Disaster Distress Hotline. New York Cares, an organization that mobilizes volunteers in the city year-round, kicked off its annual coat drive earlier than usual to meet needs caused by Sandy. The organization gathered coats at the Veteran’s Day Parade. Presbyterian Church in America – Mission to North America worked closely with local church leadership to assess needs. The organization also worked through VOAD affiliations to determine specific needs. It also mobilized volunteers to assist in Atlantic City. Quality Parks documented the impact of the hurricane on the beaches in the region and sought donations to begin a Long Island Master Naturalist program, which will train volunteers in four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Salvation Army served first responders and survivors at 16 shelters throughout New Jersey, and provided meals in 12 counties. In New York City, it is coordinated the city’s Food Access Plan, overseeing distribution of food and water to 17 sites in Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. In Nassau County, N.Y., meals ready to eat provided by the state and 1,000 blankets provided by The Salvation Army were distributed to residents of Island Park, one of the hardest hit areas. And in nearby Suffolk County, the Salvation Army worked to distribute in-kind donations for Sandy survivors. Samaritan’s Purse coordinated more than 8,600 volunteers who cleared debris, removed downed trees, and made emergency repairs for more than 1,300 homeowners. The organization also helped 40 people return home over the course of the next two years by making repairs and building new homes are at no cost to homeowners who were chosen because they lacked the means to restore their own homes or because they lost their houses completely in the hurricane. Save the Children delivered food, hygiene supplies, blankets, toys and children’s clothing to children and families in shelters. This included supplemental food for 15,545 children and their families and 150,000 diapers and other infant hygiene supplies for families with young children. They opened storm-tested Child-Friendly Spaces at 16 shelters for children who did not have safe places to play. These spaces benefited 1,485 children. Save also helped nearly 30 local centers to re-open, through grants or distributions of materials. Save the Children raised more than $3 million for the Hurricane Children in Emergency Fund. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief (SBDR) volunteers prepared more than 1 million hot meals within two weeks of landfall of Hurricane Sandy. More than 1,000 SBDR volunteers assisted victims of Hurricane Sandy. Sparkrelief.org helped feed more than 4,000 people, and partnered with Aubuchon Hardware to collect and distribute goods donated by thousands of people, and helped Lush Cosmetics distribute over $40,000 worth of bath products to those in need along the coast in New York and New Jersey. World Renew rapid response teams served in the New Jersey communities of Midland Park, Little Ferry, and Union Beach to remove downed trees, clean-out flooded homes, and prevent mold. Regional and project managers and staff assisted many communities in the early planning stages for a long-term recovery. World Renew provided start-up grants to committees in Bergen, Monmouth, and Middlesex Counties in New Jersey. World Vision disbursed over $2.4 million in assistance while working with strategic partners in providing disaster relief supplies, essential items and other non-food items that facilitated long-term recover in neighborhoods throughout New York City. Take Action Ensure the needs of vulnerable populations are being met by disaster response and recovery initiatives. These include the elderly with no young relatives, the physically and mentally disabled (including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder), etc. Invest in organizations that have a history of working in these areas and previous relationships with those involved. Additionally, assess ways to assist vulnerable populations in preparedness. Many residents in New York chose to shelter in place, which was made more difficult as power outages continued to for weeks. While some of those residents were resilient for a few days, as the disaster lingered on, living conditions became extremely challenging. Create preparedness programs that include potential outcomes, as well as weather forecast models that include consequence analysis. Improved risk analysis may help future populations be more willing to move out of harm’s way. Support further research into climate change and its effect on natural disaster occurrence. In addition, consider how this research could be linked to disaster risk reduction strategies. Develop guidelines for protecting children—both physically and psychologically—during and after disasters. Strategies for tracking displaced children, for example, could be improved, and standard protocols could be set for schools and day care centers. Explore more stable and resilient supply chains for medical needs, including prescriptions. Infrastructure damage—especially in areas of large populations—can mean many without access to the help they need. Seek out programs that aim to help with recovery and rebuilding in overlooked areas such as West Virginia, Connecticut, Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. With large population centers like New York and New Jersey affected, some of the less densely populated areas have not received as much media attention or philanthropic support. Learn More Facts & Stats Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. 286 people died, 146 of them in the U.S., making Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as the deadliest hurricane to hit the East cost since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. There were $68 billion in damages, much of it concentrated in New York and New Jersey, placing it among the worst U.S. disasters. Sandy damaged or destroyed 305,000 housing units and disrupted more than 265,000 businesses in New York. In New Jersey, 346,000 housing units were destroyed or damaged, and 190,000 businesses affected. Congress passed a $50.5 billion emergency package of relief and recovery aid. Added to the $9.7 billion previously approved for a federal flood insurance program, the total is roughly in line with the $60.4 billion President Barack Obama requested. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide.

New research by scholars, conservationists and the insurance industry shows that coastal wetlands provide hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of protection from flooding, boosting the case for protecting them.

Wary New Yorkers were keeping a close eye on weather forecasts Thursday as a strengthening Hurricane Joaquin headed north from the Bahamas and threatened the East Coast. Joaquin is now a Category 3 hurricane, packing top sustained winds of 125 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center, but is expected to strengthen to a category 4 storm, with winds topping 140 mph. And despite continued uncertainty of where or if it will make landfall, the center warned of possibly dangerous coastal flooding in New York and other Mid-Atlantic states. The latest models showed two possible scenarios, with some predicting the storm will come ashore somewhere near the North Carolina and Virginia coast. Others, including the usually accurate European Model, showed Jaoquin remaining over the Atlantic and heading north, which could mean severe flooding on the southern tip of New York City and Long Island — areas that were devastated by Superstorm Sandy. The Big Apple was already bracing for a wet weekend with a possible inch or more of rain drenching the city by Friday night. Mayor deBlasio said the city was preparing for the worst. “We’re on a state of high alert right now, we’re absolutely preparing the city for Joaquin to hit as early as Monday in earnest. There’s still different interpretations of where this storm is going but we are prepared for it to come right our way,” he said on John Gambling’s radio show. “Our Office of Emergency Management is on full alert and in full activation. We’re going to be ready either way.” Hizzoner noted there is a plan to better protect the city from flooding – but acknowledged that much of it was still years away from becoming a reality. “There’s a $20 billion plan that’s being implemented to give us a lot more resiliency to defend against hurricanes and other storms. That’s going to happen over several years but some of those pieces are already in place,” he said. “Before Sandy, unfortunately, I think a lot of us didn’t think something like that could happen here. Now, we’re in a state of readiness days before, we’re communicating to people constantly and we’ll be able to make the moves we have to to protect people.” Gov. Cuomo said Thursday the state is doing everything possible to prepare for the possibility that Joaquin will hit early next week. The state’s Emergency Operations Center will be staffed overnight, and the MTA, Port Authority and DOT are all gearing up with personnel and equipment. “I have learned the hard way it’s better to prepare for the worst. I’ve learned not to say we’re prepared for whatever comes our way because you can never be prepared for whatever comes our way,” Cuomo said. Cuomo said that in the past the state has sent resources to specific locations based on predictions that turned out to be wrong, so now it has equipment and personnel scattered across New York. The remnants of a roller coaster sit in the surf three days after Hurricane Sandy came ashore in Seaside Heights in 2012.Reuters MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast said the authority will secure locations with barricades and be prepared for a subway system shutdown should winds exceed 39 mph. The MTA will also play a key role should evacuations become necessary. The city’s OEM also took to Twitter to urge residents to review their emergency plans and go to the city’s Website to find their evacuation zone. Citi Bike was also removing several of its bike docks from Lower Manhattan in case of flooding. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday declared a state of emergency, which would allow the state and county governments to take over the storm response from local communities. Christie said was too early to tell whether Joaquin would strike the state but that he wasn’t taking any chances because of lessons learned from Sandy three years ago. The powerful storm system was causing washouts and flooding across the country before turning north Thursday night. A person was killed in Spartanburg, S.C., after severe flooding swamped multiple cars near a bridge. The victim has not been identified yet. Temperatures in New York dropped into the 60s on Thursday — with a high expected of 62 degrees. The rain will knock off a few more degrees, dropping temperatures to 57 for both Friday and Saturday. The mercury won’t get above 70 until at least Tuesday, when the stormy skies are expected to clear.

Massive Hurricane Sandy takes aim at East Coast HATTERAS ISLAND, North Carolina (Reuters) - Hurricane Sandy closed in on the United States on Saturday as it threatened to smack the eastern third of the country with torrential rains, high winds, major flooding and power outages a week before the U.S. presidential election. On its current projected track, Sandy could make U.S. landfall on Monday night or Tuesday anywhere between Maryland and southern New England, forecasters said. Rain accumulations of up to 12 inches and heavy snowfall inland are considered likely in some areas. As it merges with an Arctic jet stream, forecasters said Sandy has all the ingredients to transform into a “super storm” unlike anything seen over the eastern United States in decades. It is a massive, slow-moving storm with tropical storm-force winds extending across 650 miles. Forecasters said its flooding impact could span multiple tides with a storm surge of 4 to 8 feet in Long Island Sound, the southern portion of Lower New York Bay and Delaware Bay. Related Coverage That threat was described in a blog posted on Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com) by veteran weather forecaster Bryan Norcross as “serious as a heart attack for anybody near the rising water.” Sandy claimed at least 59 lives as it made its way through the Caribbean islands, including 44 people in southern Haiti, mostly from flash flooding and mudslides, according to authorities. Another 11 people died in Cuba, largely due to from collapsed buildings, officials said. Coming in the hectic run-up to the November 6 election, the storm presented a challenge to the campaigns of President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. As Sandy approached, Romney was rescheduling all of his campaign events planned for Virginia on Sunday and flying to Ohio instead. And Obama’s campaign announced that Vice President Joe Biden has canceled a Saturday trip to Virginia Beach. EMERGENCY PREPARATIONS Ahead of the election, millions of Americans are taking advantage of early voting arrangements to cast their ballots. State officials said they have put in place contingency plans in case Sandy caused extended power outages or other problems that could disrupt voting. The White House said Obama convened a call with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, FEMA’s Fugate and other officials to receive a Saturday update on ongoing government actions to prepare for the storm. Officials said 50 to 60 million people could be affected by Sandy, which many forecasters warn could be more destructive than Irene, which caused billions of dollars in damage across the U.S. Northeast in August 2011. “People should be ready for the possibility of power outages paired with cold temperatures. Now is the time to prepare,” Fugate said. In New York, authorities were considering closing down the city’s buses, subways, commuter railroads, bridges and tunnels in preparation for the storm’s arrival. Clouds gather over New York October 27, 2012. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri A potential shutdown could begin at 7 p.m. on Sunday, when the last commuter trains would depart, with the entire system to be closed down by 3 a.m. Monday, officials said. Sandy was located about 335 miles east southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and packing top sustained winds of 75 miles per hour late on Saturday afternoon, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. Little overall change in strength was expected ahead of its anticipated U.S. landfall, it said. The storm picked up a little forward speed but was still moving slowly over the Atlantic at 13 miles per hour. “There’s no avoiding a significant storm-surge event over a large area. We just can’t pinpoint who’s going to get the worst of it,” National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb said. ‘BLOWING PRETTY HARD’ Tropical storm-force winds were being felt near the North Carolina coast. There were tropical storm warnings for all of the coastal portion of the state, along with about half of South Carolina. High winds also threatened to disrupt air travel along the U.S. East Coast. Along North Carolina’s Outer Banks barrier islands, which jut out into the Atlantic, residents and officials said they were taking a wait-and-see approach to the storm. As the winds and rains increased Saturday, ferry service between Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands on the Outer banks was suspended due to water on Ocracoke’s only highway. “Right now it’s blowing pretty hard,” said Ray Waller, manager of the Ocracoke office of North Carolina Ferry Division. Outer Banks residents, with memories of damaging flooding from last year’s Hurricane Irene, moved vehicles to higher ground and secured outside objects ahead of winds of more than 60 mph beginning Saturday night and potentially lasting into Monday.

(CNN) -- Sandy is winding down, having spent much of its fury in the past two days crashing into homes and trees, cutting power and wrecking coastal cities. It has claimed at least 40 lives in the United States. The system still reaches from the Appalachians to the Great Lakes and beyond to Canada, and it is triggering winter storm warnings from the mountains of Pennsylvania to those of Eastern Tennessee and North Carolina. -- The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of the state Wednesday morning as heavy rainfall is expected to move through as Sandy heads toward Canada. -- More than 80% of power outages have been remedied, according to Central Power Maine. About 16,000 customers were without electricity, according to a CNN tally.

It has been a record stretch since the last major hurricane of Category 3 or greater struck the U.S. coast. Will our luck run out this year? If it does, forecasters will be ready with new computer models and storm surge maps.

The choices made in the next few years will determine the course of sea level rise for centuries to come.

Hurricane Sandy mixes super-storm conditions with climate change Author Distinguished Senior Scientist, National Center for Atmospheric Research Disclosure statement Kevin Trenberth does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. As I write this, Hurricane Sandy remains a very large, powerful hurricane. On Sunday afternoon (local time), Sandy brought winds gusting to 103km/h to coastal North Carolina. Heavy rains are already occurring from North Carolina to New Jersey with amounts recorded of 4cm so far. But Sandy is predicted to turn left and move ashore on the Atlantic coast somewhat south of New York and north of Washington DC in a day or so. Rainfalls exceeding 15cm are likely in some areas, but a major risk is from the coastal storm surge on top of very high sea levels made higher by climate change. A large easterly wind fetch has already piled waters up along the coast, and with high tide and the storm surge, and storm force winds extending a huge 800km plus from the center, the potential for the ocean surges to be over 3m is very real in the New York City area. The sea surface temperatures along the Atlantic coast have been running at over 3C above normal for a region extending 800km off shore all the way from Florida to Canada. Global warming contributes 0.6C to this. With every degree C, the water holding of the atmosphere goes up 7%, and the moisture provides fuel for the tropical storm, increases its intensity, and magnifies the rainfall by double that amount compared with normal conditions. Global climate change has contributed to the higher sea surface and ocean temperatures, and a warmer and moister atmosphere, and its effects are in the range of 5 to 10%. Natural variability and weather has provided the perhaps optimal conditions of a hurricane running into extra-tropical conditions to make for a huge intense storm, enhanced by global warming influences. My daughter lives in a ground level apartment in Hoboken New Jersey, a few hundred meters from the Hudson River, near Manhattan, New York City, in a region where the largest storm surge is predicted. My wife happens to be visiting with her and her family at the moment and as I write this, they are evacuating. They have taken many precautions including especially removing leaves (since it is autumn) from drains and sandbagging certain areas, but risk of flooding and backed up sewage and drains is high. Better safe than sorry.
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Thursday, November 15, 2012 Hurricane Sandy NWS Assessment Terminated Well, that was fast. The entire National Weather Service's "Service Assessment" for the "Hurricane Sandy Event" (as the assessment team named the study, hereinafter SA) has been terminated. In an email at 9:46 this morning, Douglas Young of the National Weather Service wrote the SA team members: I am writing to inform you that effective immediately we are terminating the spin-up of the National Weather Service Sandy Service Assessment Team.We have been informed that a larger, multi-agency review of this event may take place... [emphasis mine] The NWS, instead, decided to go ahead with its internal service assessment but for the first time put an outsider -- me -- in the co-chair position. I was told by David Caldwell, Director, Office of Climate, Water and Weather Services, that I would learn the NWS wanted an unbiased and thorough examination of Sandy. Given the scores of deaths and the huge level of damage (according to media reports 100,000+ are still without power), even with excellent forecasts the Sandy Assessment may have been the most important the National Weather Service has ever conducted. Now it has been stopped. Why? In the short period of time I worked on this project, a number of interesting questions surfaced: Was there a decision not to call Sandy a "hurricane" regardless of its meteorological characteristics? If this decision was made, was it made Friday (October 26th) or Saturday morning? If so, who made the decision and why? Was this decision the reason hurricane warnings, in spite of a large and dangerous hurricane moving toward the coast, were never issued? Given that an obvious large and powerful hurricane was headed for the U.S. coast, why wasn't that decision reconsidered? For example, Barry Myers, the CEO of AccuWeather, urged (on the AccuWeather.com website) the immediate issuance of hurricane warnings about eight hours before landfall. Others also urged the lack of hurricane warnings to be reconsidered. While the team's work officially didn't begin until Tuesday (November 13), I had already gathered hundreds of pages of information, literally dozens of suggestions, and some rather tantalizing leads that Sandy may or may not have been handled as it should have been from a scientific, administrative, or communications standpoint. Now, in spite of all of the suffering and billions in damage, we may never know how well all the storm was handled. A personal note: I was very impressed with the other members of the SA team. I'm sorry we will not be able to complete our assignment. 22 comments: I've very puzzled by this blog post. We were told for a week that a 'hurricane' was headed up the coast. I've seen disputes as to whether Sandy was actually a hurricane or not when it made landfall, but it was known that 'Frankenstorm' was coming by everyone who didn't live under a rock. And in any case, while Sandy covered an exceptionally large area, it was not a particularly strong storm. As far as I'm aware, Sandy was a borderline Cat1 storm. The term 'hurricane' may have insurance implications, but for the general public at the time, there was no mystery. And the most serious damage in New York City was a function not of the 'hurricane' rating of the storm, but of the geometry of the New York Bight, which funneled the storm surge right into New York Harbor. If Sandy had made landfall in Boston, we'd be talking about a lot of rain, and power lines down. You make this sound like some nefarious conspiracy, when - even if it was - I can't see how it matters. New England takes a battering every year from Nor'easters, with much less than hurricane winds. Could it (the investigation) have been stopped because if it is declared a hurricane then the insurance companies would have to pay out? I'm hearing from many people here in NJ... their insurance wont cover anything because it was once declared a hurricane and down graded to a tropical storm. Some even called it a cyclone. They can't categorize it except for calling it an "Act of God." And the insurance companies are using this as a way to not cover their clients. :-( @Rob: The NWS has wasted a week of my life (still have my regular job to do, was working till 1am on SA work multiple nights). I'm not going to scan documents. That said, if you would like to see some of the questions and comments for the SA take a look at my request to readers to ask questions for the SA team: http://meteorologicalmusings.blogspot.com/2012/11/hurricane-sandy-life-takes-ironic-turn.html From the infectious disease crisis / disaster point of view, this is our opinion, which agrees with yours: WHEN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE OR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISRUPTION OCCURS, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD FUNCTION UNDER MANDATE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WITH AN UNBIASED ASSESSMENT OF WARNING, WARNING-RESPONSE COUPLING, AND RESPONSE. The fact this does not occur in the public health world is a failure of governance in of itself. The fact that NWS appears to be attempting the same tact as well may be worthy of a bipartisan Congressional investigation. What usually happens when there is this large of an impact is avoidance of an open investigation by those in the elected leadership. A pattern observed over and over again. While NWS may have decided to proceed in good faith, it may be the leadership has intervened... the question is, for what purpose? "the Sandy Assessment may have been the most important the National Weather Service has ever conducted. Now it has been stopped. Why?" Maybe they read "Sirens" and got cold feet? After all, the entities that would be scrutinized this time around have even LESS excuse for their lapses/failures than SGF, SPC, local EM, etc. did in Joplin. With Sandy, all involved had DAYS of advance warning and multiple reliable forecast models agreeing (after some initial divergence) on where the storm would track. So how would they justify, for instance, not issuing hurricane warnings for a storm that looked, walked, and quacked like a hurricane? I still wonder if Hurricane Warnings would have made a difference. I say this in part from the fallout of Irene and the over forecasting of this storms intensity on the coast. If the high wind warning were questioned why not issue or create ad hoc a High Wind Warning for Hurricane Force winds? The NWS is now using enhanced tornado warnings (Tornado Emergency). Why not issue an enhanced High Wind Warning? Also too another issue was the fact that the worst coastal flooding occurred at the time of high tide and the surge. While surge was correctly forecast the storm flood tide was higher 13+ feet over the NY Bight. Advisories should have forecast maximum flood waters or potential maximum flood heights not the surge. Someone hears 6-11 feet storm surge public perception is oh 6-11 feet of water will come onshore. Also why not include communicative benchmarks in the coastal flood warning like the NWS issues with river flood warnings. e.g a river is forecast to go into MAJOR flood then the flood advisory mentions at major flood the water plant at such and such location is undated or this road or that is cutoff. Do the same kind of BM with the coastal flood warning: at 6.5 feet water enters the PATH Tubes at 7 feet they flood and water enters the trans-Hudson Tunnels. At 7.5 feet water spills over the Battery, etc. I think it would have made a difference... Bloomberg waited an extra 24 hours to order an evacuation... And did so only for zone A. If you listen to his press conference from Saturday (before the storm), it was clear he was getting intelligence that it would not be as bad as a hurricane or tropical storm. Plus, by definition, hurricane warnings automatically trigger certain evacuations and emergency steps that were not taken. In this case, time wasted = lives lost in my opinion. @Andrew: Please see my post in Mike's original blog on the assessment team's ask. To review: NWS' Meteorological Development Laboratory and the WFO's indeed have the capability to produce both storm surge INUNDATION forecasts, and potential impact wording that provides "real world" language for what a high to extreme level of impact can do (i.e. "water up to the level of a two story home"; "vehicles washed away", "Hundreds of structures inundated or washed away", etc). Both of these functions were used effectively during Isaac. My hunch is that the lack of a hurricane warning was reason for the local offices and MDL not to issue these information streams - which may have helped clarify decisions. http://weather.gov/tcig (click on an office for potential impact wording...suggest Brownsville or New Orleans for best examples) http://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/phish (Probability of Hurricane Inundation from Surge Height). "Could it (the investigation) have been stopped because if it is declared a hurricane then the insurance companies would have to pay out?" I don't think so. From what I understand (I live in the Midwest so I don't have to worry about this, but a lot of other people do), the common practice nowadays is for insurance policies to have a much higher deductible (usually a percentage of the home's total value rather than a flat dollar amount) when the damage is from a "named storm", which includes both hurricanes and tropical storms. As long as Sandy was a "named storm" that clause would apply.

Hurricane Sandy (unofficially referred to as Superstorm Sandy)[1][2] was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. Inflicting nearly $70 billion (2012 USD) in damage, it was the second-costliest hurricane on record in the United States until surpassed by hurricanes Harvey and Maria in 2017. The eighteenth named storm, tenth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the year, Sandy was a Category 3 storm at its peak intensity when it made landfall in Cuba.[3] While it was a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of the Northeastern United States, the storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record (as measured by diameter, with tropical-storm-force winds spanning 900 miles (1,400 km)).[4][5][6] At least 233 people were killed along the path of the storm in eight countries.[7][8] Sandy developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, quickly strengthened, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sandy six hours later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles and gradually intensified. On October 24, Sandy became a hurricane, made landfall near Kingston, Jamaica, re-emerged a few hours later into the Caribbean Sea and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. On October 25, Sandy hit Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane, then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. Early on October 26, Sandy moved through the Bahamas.[9] On October 27, Sandy briefly weakened to a tropical storm and then restrengthened to a Category 1 hurricane. Early on October 29, Sandy curved west-northwest (the "left turn" or "left hook") and then[10] moved ashore near Brigantine, New Jersey, just to the northeast of Atlantic City, as a post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds.[3][11] In Jamaica, winds left 70% of residents without electricity, blew roofs off buildings, killed one, and caused about $100 million (2012 USD) in damage. Sandy's outer bands brought flooding to Haiti, killing at least 54, causing food shortages, and leaving about 200,000 homeless; the hurricane also caused two deaths in the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, one man was swept away by a swollen river. In Cuba, there was extensive coastal flooding and wind damage inland, destroying some 15,000 homes, killing 11, and causing $2 billion (2012 USD) in damage. Sandy caused two deaths and damage estimated at $700 million (2012 USD) in The Bahamas. Meteorological history Hurricane Sandy began as a low pressure system which developed sufficient organized convection to be classified as Tropical Depression Eighteen on October 22 south of Kingston, Jamaica.[16] It moved slowly at first due to a ridge to the north. Low wind shear and warm waters allowed for strengthening,[16] and the system was named Tropical Storm Sandy late on October 22.[17] Early on October 24, an eye began developing, and it was moving steadily northward due to an approaching trough.[18] Later that day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded Sandy to hurricane status about 65 mi (105 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica.[19] At about 1900 UTC that day, Sandy made landfall near Kingston with winds of about 85 mph (140 km/h).[20] Just offshore Cuba, Sandy rapidly intensified to winds of 115 mph (185 km/h),[3] and at that intensity it made landfall just west of Santiago de Cuba at 0525 UTC on October 25.[21] Operationally, Sandy was assessed to have peaked as a high-end Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h).[3] After Sandy exited Cuba, the structure became disorganized,[22] and it turned to the north-northwest over the Bahamas.[23] By October 27, Sandy was no longer fully tropical, as evidenced by the development of frontal structures in the outer circulation.[3] Despite strong shear, Sandy maintained convection due to influence from an approaching trough; the same that turned the hurricane to the northeast.[24] After briefly weakening to a tropical storm,[25] Sandy re-intensified into a hurricane,[26] and on October 28 an eye began redeveloping.[27] The storm moved around an upper-level low over the eastern United States and also to the southwest of a ridge over Atlantic Canada, turning it to the northwest.[28] Sandy briefly re-intensified to Category 2 intensity on the morning of October 29, around which time it had become an extremely large hurricane with a wind diameter of over 1,000 miles (1,609 km), and an unusually low central barometric pressure of 940 mbar, possibly due to the very large size of the system.[3] This pressure set records for many cities across the Northeastern United States for the lowest pressures ever observed.[29] The convection diminished while the hurricane accelerated toward the New Jersey coast,[30] and the cyclone was no longer tropical by 2100 UTC on October 29.[31] About 2½ hours later, Sandy made landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey,[32] with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h).[3] During the next four days, Sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over Ontario, before merging with another low pressure area over Eastern Canada on November 2.[3][33] Forecasts On October 23, 2012, the path of Hurricane Sandy was correctly predicted by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) headquartered in Reading, England nearly eight days in advance of its striking the American East Coast. The computer model noted that the storm would turn west towards land and strike the New York/New Jersey region on October 29, rather than turn east and head out to the open Atlantic as most hurricanes in this position do. By October 27, four days after the ECMWF made its prediction, the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center confirmed the path of the hurricane predicted by the European model. The National Weather Service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its European counterpart did. A hardware and software upgrade completed at the end of 2013 enabled the weather service to make more accurate predictions, and do so far more in advance than the technology in 2012 had allowed.[34] Relation to global warming According to NCAR senior climatologist Kevin E. Trenberth, "The answer to the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by climate change is that it is the wrong question. All weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be."[35] Although NOAA meteorologist Martin Hoerling attributes Sandy to "little more than the coincidental alignment of a tropical storm with an extratropical storm",[36] Trenberth does agree that the storm was caused by "natural variability" but adds that it was "enhanced by global warming".[37] One factor contributing to the storm's strength was abnormally warm sea surface temperatures offshore the East Coast of the United States—more than 3 °C (5 °F) above normal, to which global warming had contributed 0.6 °C (1 °F).[37] As the temperature of the atmosphere increases, the capacity to hold water increases, leading to stronger storms and higher rainfall amounts.[37] As they move north, Atlantic hurricanes typically are forced east and out to sea by the Prevailing Westerlies.[38] In Sandy's case, this typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over Greenland resulting in a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, forming a kink in the jet stream, causing it to double back on itself off the East Coast. Sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow.[38] The blocking pattern over Greenland also stalled an Arctic front which combined with the cyclone.[38] Mark Fischetti of Scientific American said that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by the melting of Arctic ice.[39] Trenberth said that while a negative North Atlantic Oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place, the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.[36] Sea level at New York and along the New Jersey coast has increased by nearly a foot (300 mm) over the last hundred years,[40] which contributed to the storm surge.[41] Harvard geologist Daniel P. Schrag calls Hurricane Sandy's 13-foot (4 m) storm surge an example of what will, by mid-century, be the "new norm on the Eastern seaboard".[42] Preparations Caribbean and Bermuda After the storm became a tropical cyclone on October 22, the Government of Jamaica issued a tropical storm watch for the entire island.[43] Early on October 23, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued.[44] At 1500 UTC, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning, while the tropical storm warning was discontinued.[45] In preparation of the storm, many residents stocked up on supplies and reinforced roofing material. Acting Prime Minister Peter Phillips urged people to take this storm seriously, and also to take care of their neighbors, especially the elderly, children, and disabled. Government officials shut down schools, government buildings, and the airport in Kingston on the day prior to the arrival of Sandy. Meanwhile, numerous and early curfews were put in place to protect residents, properties, and to prevent crime.[46] Shortly after Jamaica issued its first watch on October 22, the Government of Haiti issued a tropical storm watch for Haiti.[47] By late October 23, it was modified to a tropical storm warning.[48] United States Much of the East Coast of the United States, in Mid-Atlantic and New England regions, had a good chance of receiving gale-force winds, flooding, heavy rain and possibly snow early in the week of October 28 from an unusual hybrid of Hurricane Sandy and a winter storm producing a Fujiwhara effect.[52] Government weather forecasters said there was a 90% chance that the East Coast would be impacted by the storm. Jim Cisco of the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center coined the term "Frankenstorm", as Sandy was expected to merge with a storm front a few days before Halloween.[53][54][55] As coverage continued, several media outlets began eschewing this term in favor of "superstorm".[56][57] Utilities and governments along the East Coast attempted to head off long-term power failures Sandy might cause. Power companies from the Southeast to New England alerted independent contractors to be ready to help repair storm damaged equipment quickly and asked employees to cancel vacations and work longer hours. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University, using a computer model built on power outage data from previous hurricanes, conservatively forecast that 10 million customers along the Eastern Seaboard would lose power from the storm.[58] Through regional offices in Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) monitored Sandy, closely coordinating with state and tribal emergency management partners in Florida and the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and New England states.[59]President Obama signed emergency declarations on October 28 for several states expected to be impacted by Sandy, allowing them to request federal aid and make additional preparations in advance of the storm.[60] Flight cancellations and travel alerts on the U.S. East Coast were put in place in the Mid-Atlantic and the New England areas.[61] Over 5,000 commercial airline flights scheduled for October 28 and October 29 were canceled by the afternoon of October 28[62] and Amtrak canceled some services through October 29 in preparation for the storm.[63] In addition, the National Guard and U.S. Air Force put as many as 45,000 personnel in at least seven states on alert for possible duty in response to the preparations and aftermath of Sandy.[64] Southeast A tilted satellite image of the storm on October 28, with most of the U.S. coastline artificially highlighted. The entire east coast is visible, with a cloudless Florida coast seen at the bottom of the image and the outline of the coast of Maine at the top right. Maryland Governor of MarylandMartin O'Malley declared a state of emergency on October 26.[71] By the following day, Smith Island residents were evacuated with the assistance of the Maryland Natural Resources Police, Dorchester County opened two shelters for those in flood prone areas, and Ocean City initiated Phase I of their Emergency Operations Plan.[80][81][82] Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. put workers on standby and made plans to bring in crews from other states.[83] On October 28, President Obama declared an emergency in Maryland and signed an order authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to aid in disaster relief efforts.[84] Also, numerous areas were ordered to be evacuated including part of Ocean City, Worcester County, Wicomico County, and Somerset County.[85][86] Officials warned that more than a hundred million tons of dirty sediment mixed with tree limbs and debris floating behind Conowingo Dam could be eventually poured into the Chesapeake Bay, posing a potential environmental threat.[87] On October 28, Mayor of HobokenDawn Zimmer ordered residents of basement and street-level residential units to evacuate, due to possible flooding.[101] On October 29, residents of Logan Township were ordered to evacuate.[102]Jersey Central Power & Light told employees to prepare to work extended shifts.[83] Most schools, colleges and universities were closed October 29 while at least 509 out of 580 school districts were closed October 30.[103] Although tropical storm conditions were inevitable and hurricane-force winds were likely, the National Hurricane Center did not issue any tropical cyclone watches or warnings for New Jersey, because Sandy was forecast to become extratropical before landfall and thus would not be a tropical cyclone.[104] Pennsylvania Preparations in Pennsylvania began when GovernorTom Corbett declared a state of emergency on October 26.[71]Mayor of PhiladelphiaMichael Nutter asked residents in low-lying areas and neighborhoods prone to flooding to leave their homes by 1800 UTC October 28 and move to safer ground.[105] The Philadelphia International Airport suspended all flight operations for October 29.[106] On October 29, Philadelphia shut down its mass transit system.[79] On October 28, Mayor of HarrisburgLinda D. Thompson declared a state of disaster emergency for the city to go into effect at 5 a.m. October 29. Electric utilities in the state brought in crews and equipment from other states such as New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, to assist with restoration efforts.[107] New York City began taking precautions on October 26. Governor Cuomo ordered the closure of MTA and its subway on October 28, and the MTA suspended all subway, bus, and commuter rail service beginning at 2300 UTC.[116] After Hurricane Irene nearly submerged subways and tunnels in 2011,[117] entrances and grates were covered just before Sandy, but were still flooded.[118]PATH train service and stations as well as the Port Authority Bus Terminal were shut down in the early morning hours of October 29.[119][120] Later on October 28, officials activated the coastal emergency plan, with subway closings and the evacuation of residents in areas hit by Hurricane Irene in 2011. More than 76 evacuation shelters were open around the city.[108] On October 29, Mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered public schools closed[119] and called for a mandatory evacuation of Zone A, which comprised areas near coastlines or waterways.[121] Additionally, 200 National Guard troops were deployed in the city.[120]NYU Langone Medical Center canceled all surgeries and medical procedures, except for emergency procedures.[120] Additionally, one of NYU Langone Medical Center's backup generators failed on October 29, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of patients, including those from the hospital's various intensive care units.[122] U.S. stock trading was suspended for October 29–30.[123] New England Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy partially activated the state's Emergency Operations Center on October 26[124] and signed a Declaration of Emergency the next day.[125] On October 28, President Obama approved Connecticut's request for an emergency declaration, and hundreds of National Guard personnel were deployed.[126] On October 29, Governor Malloy ordered road closures for all state highways.[127] Numerous mandatory and partial evacuations were issued in cities across Connecticut.[128] Appalachia and the Midwest The National Weather Service issued a storm warning for Lake Huron on October 29 that called for wave heights of 26 feet (7.9 m), and possibly as high as 38 feet (12 m). Lake Michigan waves were expected to reach 19 feet (5.8 m), with a potential of 33 feet (10 m) on October 30.[133] Flood warnings were issued in Chicago on October 29, where wave heights were expected to reach 18 to 23 feet (5.5 to 7.0 m) in Cook County and 25 feet (7.6 m) in northwest Indiana.[134] Gale warnings were issued for Lake Michigan and Green Bay in Wisconsin until the morning of October 31, and waves of 33 feet (10 m) in Milwaukee and 20 feet (6.1 m) in Sheboygan were predicted for October 30.[135] The actual waves reached about 20 feet (6.1 m) but were less damaging than expected.[136][137] The village of Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin urged a voluntary evacuation of its lakefront area, though few residents signed up, and little flooding actually occurred.[135][137] Michigan was impacted by a winter storm system coming in from the west, mixing with cold air streams from the Arctic and colliding with Hurricane Sandy.[133] The forecasts slowed shipping traffic on the Great Lakes, as some vessels sought shelter away from the peak winds, except those on Lake Superior.[138][139]Detroit-based DTE Energy released 100 contract line workers to assist utilities along the eastern U.S. with storm response, and Consumers Energy did the same with more than a dozen employees and 120 contract employees.[140] Due to the widespread power outages, numerous schools had to close, especially in St. Clair County and areas along Lake Huron north of Metro Detroit.[141] Caribbean Jamaica Jamaica was the first country directly affected by Sandy, which was also the first hurricane to make landfall on the island since Hurricane Gilbert, 24 years prior. Trees and power lines were snapped and shanty houses were heavily damaged, both from the winds and flooding rains. More than 100 fishermen were stranded in outlying Pedro Cays off Jamaica's southern coast.[170] Stones falling from a hillside crushed one man to death as he tried to get into his house in a rural village near Kingston.[171] After 6 days another fatality recorded as a 27-year-old man, died due to electrocution, attempting a repair.[7] The country's sole electricity provider, the Jamaica Public Service Company, reported that 70 percent of its customers were without power. More than 1,000 people went to shelters. Jamaican authorities closed the island's international airports, and police ordered 48-hour curfews in major towns to keep people off the streets and deter looting.[172] Most buildings in the eastern portion of the island lost their roofs.[173] Damage was assessed at approximately $100 million throughout the country.[3] Hispaniola In Haiti, which was still recovering from both the 2010 earthquake and the ongoing cholera outbreak, at least 54 people died,[163] and approximately 200,000 were left homeless as a result of four days of ongoing rain from Hurricane Sandy.[174] Heavy damage occurred in Port-Salut after rivers overflowed their banks.[175] In the capital of Port-au-Prince, streets were flooded by the heavy rains, and it was reported that "the whole south of the country is underwater".[176] Most of the tents and buildings in the city's sprawling refugee camps and the Cité Soleil neighborhood were flooded or leaking, a repeat of what happened earlier in the year during the passage of Hurricane Isaac.[173] Crops were also wiped out by the storm and the country would be making an appeal for emergency aid.[177] Damage in Haiti was estimated at $750 million (2012 USD), making it the costliest tropical cyclone in Haitian history.[164] In the month following Sandy, a resurgence of cholera linked to the storm killed at least 44 people and infected more than 5,000 others.[166] At least 55,000 people were evacuated before Hurricane Sandy's arrival.[188] While moving ashore, the storm produced waves up to 29 feet (9 meters) and a 6-foot (2 meter) storm surge that caused extensive coastal flooding.[189] There was widespread damage, particularly to Santiago de Cuba where 132,733 homes were damaged, of which 15,322 were destroyed and 43,426 lost their roof.[159] Electricity and water services were knocked out, and most of the trees in the city were damaged. Total losses throughout Santiago de Cuba province is estimated as high as $2 billion (2012 USD).[160] Sandy killed 11 people in the country – nine in Santiago de Cuba Province and two in Guantánamo Province; most of the victims were trapped in destroyed houses.[190][191] This makes Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit Cuba since 2005, when Hurricane Dennis killed 16 people.[192] Bahamas A NOAA automated station at Settlement Point on Grand Bahama Island reported sustained winds of 49 mph (74 km/h) and a wind gust of 63 mph (102 km/h).[193] One person died from falling off his roof while attempting to fix a window shutter in the Lyford Cay area on New Providence. Another died in the Queen's Cove area on Grand Bahama Island where he drowned after the sea surge trapped him in his apartment.[154] Portions of the Bahamas lost power or cellular service, including an islandwide power outage on Bimini. Five homes were severely damaged near Williams's Town.[194] Overall damage in the Bahamas was about $700 million (2012 USD), with the most severe damage on Cat Island and Exuma where many houses were heavily damaged by wind and storm surge.[155] Bermuda Owing to the sheer size of the storm, Sandy also impacted Bermuda with high winds and heavy rains. On October 28, a weak F0 tornado touched down in Sandys Parish, damaging homes and businesses.[195] During a three-day span, the storm produced 0.98 in (25 mm) of rain at the L.F. Wade International Airport. The strongest winds were recorded on October 29: sustained winds reached 37 mph (60 km/h) and gusts peaked at 58 mph (93 km/h), which produced scattered minor damage.[196] A total of 24 U.S. states were in some way affected by Sandy. The hurricane caused tens of billions of dollars in damage in the United States, destroyed thousands of homes, left millions without electric service,[198] and caused 71 direct deaths in nine states, including 49 in New York, 10 in New Jersey, 3 in Connecticut, 2 each in Pennsylvania and Maryland, and 1 each in New Hampshire, Virginia and West Virginia.[7] There were also 2 direct deaths from Sandy in U.S. coastal waters in the Atlantic Ocean, about 90 miles (150 km) off the North Carolina coast, which are not counted in the U.S. total. In addition, the storm resulted in 87 indirect deaths.[3] In all, a total of 160 people were killed due to the storm, making Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the deadliest to hit the U.S. East Coast since Hurricane Agnes in 1972.[199] Due to flooding and other storm-related problems, Amtrak canceled all Acela Express, Northeast Regional, Keystone, and Shuttle services for October 29 and 30.[200][201] More than 13,000 flights were canceled across the U.S. on October 29, and more than 3,500 were called off October 30.[202] From October 27 through early November 1, airlines canceled a total of 19,729 flights, according to FlightAware.[203] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq reopened on October 31 after a two-day closure for the storm.[205] More than 1,500 FEMA personnel were along the East Coast working to support disaster preparedness and response operations, including search and rescue, situational awareness, communications and logistical support. In addition, 28 teams containing 294 FEMA Corps members were pre-staged to support Sandy responders. Three federal urban search and rescue task forces were positioned in the Mid-Atlantic and ready to deploy as needed.[206] On November 2, the American Red Cross announced they had 4,000 disaster workers across storm damaged areas, with thousands more en route from other states. Nearly 7,000 people spent the night in emergency shelters across the region.[207] As of November 5, 2012, the National Hurricane Center ranks Hurricane Sandy the second-costliest US hurricane since 1900 in constant 2010 dollars, and the sixth-costliest after adjusting for inflation, population and property values.[209] Their report also states that due to global warming the number of future hurricanes will "either decrease or remain essentially unchanged" overall, but the ones that do form will likely be stronger, with fiercer winds and heavier rains.[209] Scientists at the University of Utah reported the energy generated by Sandy was equivalent to "small earthquakes between magnitudes 2 and 3".[210] Southeast Florida In South Florida, Sandy lashed the area with rough surf, strong winds, and brief squalls. Along the coast of Miami-Dade County, waves reached 10 feet (3.0 m), but may have been as high as 20 feet (6.1 m) in Palm Beach County. In the former county, minor pounding occurred on a few coastal roads. Further north in Broward County, State Road A1A was inundated with sand and water, causing more than a 2 miles (3.2 km) stretch of the road to be closed for the entire weekend. Additionally, coastal flooding extended inland up to 2 blocks in some locations and a few houses in the area suffered water damage. In Manalapan, which is located in southern Palm Beach County, several beachfront homes were threatened by erosion. The Lake Worth Pier was also damaged by rough seas. In Palm Beach County alone, losses reached $14 million.[211] Sandy caused closures and cancellations of some activities at schools in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties.[212] Storm surge from Sandy also caused flooding and beach erosion along coastal areas in South Florida.[213] Gusty winds also impacted South Florida, peaking at 67 mph (108 km/h) in Jupiter and Fowey Rocks Light, which is near Key Biscayne.[211] The storm left power outages across the region, which left many traffic lights out of order.[214] Two panther kittens escaped from the White Oak Conservation Center in Nassau County after the hurricane swept a tree into the fence of their enclosure; they were missing for 24 hours before being found in good health.[218] North Carolina The 180-foot (55 m) sailing ship, Bounty, is shown nearly submerged during Hurricane Sandy in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 90 miles (140 km) southeast of Hatteras, North Carolina on Monday, October 29, 2012. On October 28, Governor Bev Perdue declared a state of emergency in 24 western counties, due to snow and strong winds.[219] North Carolina was spared from major damage for the most part (except at the immediate coastline), though winds, rain, and mountain snow affected the state through October 30. Ocracoke and Highway 12 on Hatteras Island were flooded with up to 2 feet (0.6 m) of water, closing part of the highway, while 20 people on a fishing trip were stranded on Portsmouth Island.[220] On October 29, the Coast Guard responded to a distress call from Bounty, which was built for the 1962 movie Mutiny on the Bounty. It was taking on water about 90 miles (150 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras. Sixteen people were on board.[222] The Coast Guard said the 16 people abandoned ship and got into two lifeboats, wearing survival suits and life jackets.[223] The ship sank after the crew got off.[224] The Coast Guard rescued 14 crew members; another was found hours later but was unresponsive and later died.[225] The search for the captain, Robin Walbridge, was suspended on November 1, after efforts lasting more than 90 hours and covering approximately 12,000 square nautical miles (41,100 km²).[226] Virginia On October 29, snow was falling in parts of the state.[145] Gov. Bob McDonnell announced on October 30 that Virginia had been "spared a significant event", but cited concerns about rivers cresting and consequent flooding of major arteries. Virginia was awarded a federal disaster declaration, with Gov. McDonnell saying he was "delighted" that President Barack Obama and FEMA were on it immediately. At Sandy's peak, more than 180,000 customers were without power, most of whom were located in Northern Virginia.[204][227] There were three Hurricane Sandy-related fatalities in the state.[7][169] Delaware By the afternoon of October 29, rainfall at Rehoboth Beach totaled 6.53 inches (166 mm). Other precipitation reports include nearly 7 inches (180 mm) at Indian River Inlet and more than 4 inches (100 mm) in Dover and Bear. At 4 p.m. on October 29, Delmarva Power reported on its website that more than 13,900 customers in Delaware and portions of the Eastern Shore of Maryland had lost electric service as high winds brought down trees and power lines. About 3,500 of those were in New Castle County, 2,900 were in Sussex, and more than 100 were in Kent County. Some residents in Kent and Sussex Counties experienced power outages that lasted up to nearly six hours. At the peak of the storm, more than 45,000 customers in Delaware were without power.[204] The Delaware Memorial Bridge speed limit was reduced to 25 mph (40 km/h) and the two outer lanes in each direction were closed. Officials planned to close the span entirely if sustained winds exceeded 50 mph (80 km/h). A wind gust of 64 mph (103 km/h) was measured at Lewes just before 2:30 p.m. on October 29. Delaware Route 1 was closed due to water inundation between Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island. In Dewey Beach, flood waters were 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) in depth.[237] Following the impact in Delaware, President Barack Obama declared the entire state a federal disaster area, providing money and agencies for disaster relief in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.[238] New Jersey A 50-foot (15 m) piece of the Atlantic City Boardwalk washed away. Half the city of Hoboken flooded; the city of 50,000 had to evacuate two of its fire stations, the EMS headquarters, and the hospital. With the city cut off from area hospitals and fire suppression mutual aid, the city's Mayor asked for National Guard help.[225] In the early morning of October 30, authorities in Bergen County, New Jersey, evacuated residents after a berm overflowed and flooded several communities. Police Chief of Staff Jeanne Baratta said there were up to five feet (1.5 m) of water in the streets of Moonachie and Little Ferry. The state Office of Emergency Management said rescues were undertaken in Carlstadt.[239] Baratta said the three towns had been "devastated" by the flood of water.[240] At the peak of the storm, more than 2,600,000 customers were without power.[204] There were 43 Hurricane Sandy-related deaths in the state of New Jersey.[7][241] Damage in the state was estimated at $36.8 billion.[242] The East River overflowed its banks, flooding large sections of Lower Manhattan. Battery Park had a water surge of 13.88 ft.[252] Seven subway tunnels under the East River were flooded.[253] The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that the destruction caused by the storm was the worst disaster in the 108-year history of the New York City subway system.[254] Sea water flooded the Ground Zero construction site.[255] Over 10 billion gallons of raw and partially treated sewage were released by the storm, 94% of which went into waters in and around New York and New Jersey.[256] In addition, a four-story Chelsea building's facade crumbled and collapsed, leaving the interior on full display; however, no one was hurt by the falling masonry.[257] The Atlantic Ocean storm surge also caused considerable flood damage to homes, buildings, roadways, boardwalks and mass transit facilities in low-lying coastal areas of the outer boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. After receiving many complaints that holding the marathon would divert needed resources, Mayor Bloomberg announced late afternoon November 2 that the New York City Marathon had been canceled. The event was to take place on Sunday, November 4. Marathon officials said that they did not plan to reschedule.[258] Gas shortages throughout the region led to an effort by the U.S. federal government to bring in gasoline and set up mobile truck distribution at which people could receive up to 10 gallons of gas, free of charge. This caused lines of up to 20 blocks long and was quickly suspended.[259] On Thursday, November 8, Mayor Bloomberg announced odd-even rationing of gasoline would be in effect beginning November 9 until further notice.[260] On November 26, Governor Cuomo called Sandy "more impactful" than Hurricane Katrina, and estimated costs to New York at $42 billion.[261] Approximately 100,000 residences on Long Island were destroyed or severely damaged, including 2,000 that were rendered uninhabitable.[262] There were 53 Hurricane Sandy-related deaths in the state of New York.[263] In 2016, the hurricane was determined to have been the worst to strike the New York City area since at least 1700.[264] New England Wind gusts to 83 mph were recorded on outer Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay.[265] Nearly 300,000 customers were without power in Massachusetts,[204] and roads and buildings were flooded.[266] Over 100,000 customers lost power in Rhode Island.[267] Most of the damage was along the coastline, where some communities were flooded.[268]Mount Washington, New Hampshire saw the strongest measured wind gust from the storm at 140 mph.[269] Nearly 142,000 customers lost power in the state.[204] Appalachia and Midwest West Virginia Sandy's rain became snow in the Appalachian mountains, leading to blizzard conditions in some areas, especially West Virginia,[3] when a tongue of dense and heavy Arctic air pushed south through the region. This would normally cause a Nor'easter, prompting some to dub Sandy a "nor'eastercane" or "Frankenstorm".[270] There was 1–3 feet (30–91 cm) of snowfall in 28 of West Virginia's 55 counties.[3][271] The highest snowfall accumulation was 36 inches (91 cm) near Richwood.[3] Other significant totals include 32 inches (81 cm) in Snowshoe, 29 inches (74 cm) in Quinwood,[272] and 28 inches (71 cm) in Davis, Flat Top, and Huttonsville.[273] By the morning of October 31, there were still 36 roads closed due to downed trees, powerlines, and snow in the road.[272] Approximately 271,800 customers lost power during the storm.[204] There were reports of collapsed buildings in several counties due to the sheer weight of the wet, heavy snow.[274] Overall, there were seven fatalities related to Hurricane Sandy and its remnants in West Virginia,[275] including John Rose, Sr., the Republican candidate for the state's 47th district in the state legislature, who was killed in the aftermath of the storm by a falling tree limb broken off by the heavy snowfall.[276]GovernorEarl Ray Tomblin asked President Obama for a federal disaster declaration, and on October 30, President Obama approved a state of emergency declaration for the state.[277] Michigan The US Department of Energy reported that more than 120,000 customers lost power in Michigan as a result of the storm.[204] The National Weather Service said that waves up to 23 feet (7 m) high were reported on southern Lake Huron.[141] Canada The remnants of Sandy produced high winds along Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, where gusts were measured at 105 km/h (63 mph). A 121 km/h (72 mph) gust was measured on top of the Bluewater Bridge.[282] One woman died after being hit by a piece of flying debris in Toronto.[156] At least 145,000 customers across Ontario lost power,[283] and a Bluewater Power worker was electrocuted in Sarnia while working to restore power.[284] Around 49,000 homes and businesses lost power in Quebec during the storm, with nearly 40,000 of those in the Laurentides region of the province, as well as more than 4,000 customers in the Eastern Townships and 1,700 customers in Montreal.[285] Hundreds of flights were canceled.[286] Around 14,000 customers in Nova Scotia lost power during the height of the storm.[287] The Insurance Bureau of Canada's preliminary damage estimate was over $100 million for the nation.[158] On December 28, 2012, the United States Senate approved an emergency Hurricane Sandy relief bill to provide $60 billion for US states affected by Sandy,[294] but the House in effect postponed action until the next session which began January 3 by adjourning without voting on the bill.[295] On January 4, 2013 House leaders pledged to vote on a flood insurance bill and an aid package by January 15.[296] On January 28, the Senate passed the $50.5 billion Sandy aid bill by a count of 62–36.[297] which President Obama signed into law January 29.[298] In January 2013, The New York Times reported that those affected by the hurricane were still struggling to recover.[299] In June 2013, NY Governor Andrew Cuomo set out to centralize recovery and rebuilding efforts in impacted areas of New York State by establishing the Governor's Office of Storm Recovery (GOSR). He aimed to address communities' most urgent needs, and to identify innovative and enduring solutions to strengthen the State's infrastructure and critical systems. Operating under the umbrella of New York Rising, GOSR utilized approximately $3.8 billion in flexible funding made available by the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program to concentrate aid in four main areas: housing, small business, infrastructure, and the community reconstruction.[300] On December 6, 2013, an analysis of Federal Emergency Management Agency data showed that fewer than half of those affected who requested disaster recovery assistance had received any, and a total of 30,000 residents of New York and New Jersey remained displaced.[301] In March 2014, Newsday reported, that 17 months after the hurricane people displaced from rental units on Long Island faced unique difficulties due to lack of affordable rental housing and delays in housing program implementations by New York State. Close to 9,000 rental units on Long Island were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, and Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011 per the NY State Governor's Office of Storm Recovery (GOSR).[302] New York State officials said that additional assistance would soon be available from the HUD's Community Development Block Grant funds via the New York Rising program.[303] On March 15, 2014, a group of those who remained displaced by the hurricane organized a protest at the Nassau Legislative building in Mineola, New York, to raise awareness of their frustration with the timeline for receiving financial assistance from the New York Rising program.[304] As of March 2014[update], the GOSR released a press statement, that the New York Rising Community Reconstruction Program had distributed more than $280 million in payments to 6,388 homeowners for damage from Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Irene or Tropical Storm Lee. Every eligible homeowner who had applied by January 20, 2014 had been issued a check for home reconstruction, including over 4,650 Nassau residents for over $201 million and over 1,350 Suffolk residents for over $65 million. The State also had made offers over $293 million to buyout homes of 709 homeowners.[305] The storm hit the United States one week before its general United States elections, and affected the presidential campaign, local and state campaigns in storm-damaged areas. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, one of Mitt Romney's leading supporters, praised President Barack Obama and his reaction to the hurricane, and toured storm-damaged areas of his state with the president.[310] It was reported at the time that Sandy might affect elections in several states, especially by curtailing early voting.[311]The Economist wrote, "the weather is supposed to clear up well ahead of election day, but the impact could be felt in the turnout of early voters."[312]ABC News predicted this might be offset by a tendency to clear roads and restore power more quickly in urban areas.[313] The storm ignited a debate over whether Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2011 proposed to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).[314] The next day the Romney campaign promised to keep FEMA funded, but did not explain what other parts of the federal budget it would cut to pay for it.[315] Beyond the election, National Defense Magazine said Sandy "might cause a rethinking (in the USA) of how climate change threatens national security".[316] In his news conference on November 14, 2012, President Obama said, "we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting faster than was predicted even five years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily — there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe. And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it."[317] On January 30, 2015, days after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a post-Sandy report examining flood risks for 31,200 miles (50,210 km) of the North Atlantic coast, President Obama issued an executive order directing federal agencies, state and local governments drawing federal funds to adopt stricter building and siting standards to reflect scientific projections that future flooding will be more frequent and intense due to climate change.[318] Financial markets impact This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(March 2017) Power outages and flooding in the area closed the New York Stock Exchange and other financial markets on both October 29 and 30, a weather-related closure that last happened in 1888.[319] When markets reopened on October 31, investors were relieved that it closed relatively flat that day. A week later, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Capital Markets Bureau noted a slight uptick in the market (0.8%) and suggested that the negative economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was offset by the expected positive impacts of rebuilding.[320] Media coverage As Hurricane Sandy approached the United States, forecasters and journalists gave it several different unofficial names, at first related to its projected snow content, then to its proximity to Halloween, and eventually to the overall size of the storm. Early nicknames included "Snowicane Sandy"[321] and "Snor'eastercane Sandy".[322][323] The most popular Halloween-related nickname was "Frankenstorm",[324][325] coined by Jim Cisco, a forecaster at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.[326][327][328] CNN banned the use of the term, saying it trivialized the destruction.[329][330] The severe and widespread damage the storm caused in the United States, as well as its unusual merger with a frontal system, resulted in the nicknaming of the hurricane "Superstorm Sandy" by the media, public officials, and several organizations, including U.S. government agencies.[331][332][333][334][335][336][337] This persisted as the most common nickname well into 2013.[338][339] The term was also embraced by climate change proponents as a term for the new type of storms caused by global warming,[340][improper synthesis?] while other writers used the term but maintained that it was too soon to blame the storm on climate change.[341][342] Meanwhile, Popular Science called it "an imaginary scare-term that exists exclusively for shock value".[343] Insurance fraud claims Thousands of homeowners were denied their flood insurance claims based upon fraudulent engineers' reports, according to the whistleblowing efforts of Andrew Braum, an engineer who claimed that at least 175 of his more than 180 inspections were doctored.[344][345] As a result, a class-action racketeering lawsuit has been filed against several insurance companies and their contract engineering firms.[346] As of 2015[update], the Federal Emergency Management Agency planned to review all flood insurance claims.[347] Baby boom New Jersey hospitals saw a spike in births nine months after Sandy, causing some to believe that there was a post-Sandy baby boom. The Monmouth Medical Center saw a 35% jump, and two other hospitals saw 20% increases.[348] An expert stated that post-storm births that year were higher than in past disasters.[349] ^ abcTrenberth, Kevin.

The sea surface temperatures along the Atlantic coast have been running at over 3°C above normal for a region extending 800 km off shore all the way from Florida to Canada. Global warming contributes 0.6°C to this. With every degree C, the water holding of the atmosphere goes up 7%, and the moisture provides fuel for the tropical storm, increases its intensity, and magnifies the rainfall by double that amount compared with normal conditions. Global climate change has contributed to the higher sea surface and ocean temperatures, and a warmer and moister atmosphere, and its effects are in the range of 5 to 10%. Natural variability and weather has provided the perhaps optimal conditions of a hurricane running into extra-tropical conditions to make for a huge intense storm, enhanced by global warming influences. ^Mason, Edward (6 November 2012).

Tuesday, October 30, 2012 More on Sandy Line of electricity utility trucks eastbound on I-70 at Wright City, MO this morning Sources I trust tell me 8.5 million electrical customers (homes and businesses) are currently without power. That translates to 25 to 30 million people. Crews are rushing in from around the nation but, given the geographic extent of the outages, it will be more than two weeks, and likely more than three, before power is completely restored (my opinion). The figures you are heaving in the media estimating total losses (i.e., direct damage plus economic loss) of $8 to $20 million are, in my opinion, way too low. Time will tell. AccuWeather regional radar at 12:23pm EDT shows Sandy has spread out with winter conditions over the central Appalachians. There are still quite a few areas of gusty winds but they will largely diminish after sunset.
After the Devastation, a Daunting Recovery Keith Klein and Eileen Blair among homes destroyed by fire in the Breezy Point section of Queens.Credit Shannon Stapleton/Reuters The New York region began the daunting process on Tuesday of rebuilding in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy , a storm that remade the landscape and rewrote the record books as it left behind a tableau of damage, destruction and grief. The toll — in lives disrupted or lost and communities washed out — was staggering. A rampaging fire reduced more than 100 houses to ash in Breezy Point, Queens . Explosions and downed power lines left the lower part of Manhattan and 90 percent of Long Island in the dark. The New York City subway system — a lifeline for millions — was paralyzed by flooded tunnels and was expect to remain silent for days. Accidents claimed more than 40 lives in the United States and Canada , including 22 in the city. Two boys — an 11-year-old Little League star and a 13-year-old friend — were killed when a 90-foot-tall tree smashed into the family room of a house in North Salem, N.Y. An off-duty police officer who led seven relatives, including a 15-month-old boy, to safety in the storm drowned when he went to check on the basement. On Tuesday, the storm slogged toward the Midwest, vastly weaker than it was when it made landfall in New Jersey on Monday night. It delivered rain and high winds all the way to the Great Lakes , where freighters were at a standstill in waves two stories tall. It left snow in Appalachia, power failures in Maine and untreated sewage pouring into the Patuxent River in Maryland after a treatment plant lost power. President Obama approved disaster declarations for New York and New Jersey, making them eligible for federal assistance for rebuilding. “All of us have been shocked by the force of mother nature,” said the president, who plans to visit New Jersey on Wednesday. He promised “all available resources” for recovery efforts. “This is going to take some time,” he said. “It is not going to be easy for these communities to recover.” There was no immediate estimate of the losses from the storm, but the scope of the damage — covering more than a half-dozen states — pointed to billions of dollars. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called it “incalculable.” Rescuers looked for survivors in the wet rubble in places like Atlantic City , and state and local officials surveyed wreckage. Utility crews began working their way through a wilderness of fallen trees and power lines. And from Virginia to Connecticut , there were stories of tragedy and survival — of people who lost everything when the water rushed in, of buildings that crumbled after being pounded hour after hour by rain and relentless wind, of hospitals that had to be evacuated when the storm knocked out the electricity. The president spoke with 20 governors and mayors on a conference call, and the White House said the president would survey damage from the storm with Mr. Christie on Wednesday. Mr. Obama’s press secretary said the president would join Mr. Christie, who has been one of his harshest Republican critics, in talking with storm victims and thanking first responders. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Mr. Obama had also offered to visit the city, “but I think the thing for him to do is to go to New Jersey and represent the country.” Connecticut, New Jersey and New York reopened many closed roads and bridges, and the New York Stock Exchange made plans to resume floor trading on Wednesday after a two-day shutdown, its first because of weather since a blizzard in 1888. There were no traffic signals on the walk from Fifth Avenue to the East River. Police officers were directing traffic; here and there, bodegas were open, selling batteries and soft drinks. In Times Square, a few tourists walked around, though some hotels still had sandbags by the doors. New York’s subway network, which suffered the worst damage in its 108-year-history, faced one of its longest shutdowns because the problems were so much worse than expected, said Joseph J. Lhota , the chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , the agency that runs the subways and several commuter railroads. Video The Storm Cleanup Begins TimesCast: Updates on the recovery efforts in New York City and beyond. By Mac William Bishop, Pedro Rosado, Nadia Sussman and David Frank on Publish Date October 30, 2012. . Watch in Times Video » Water climbed to the ceiling of the South Ferry subway station, the end of the No. 1 line in Lower Manhattan, and debris covered tracks in stations up and down other lines after the water rushed in and out. Mr. Lhota said that seven subway tunnels between Manhattan and Brooklyn were flooded. He also said that the Metro-North Railroad had no power north of 59th Street on two of its three lines, and that a 40-foot boat had washed up on the tracks in Ossining, N.Y. The Long Island Rail Road ’s West Side Yards had to be evacuated, and two railroad tunnels beneath the East River were flooded in the storm. The railroad had not restored power on Tuesday and had no timetable for restoring service. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel, and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel also remained impassable, he said. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Airports, too, took a beating. More than 15,000 flights were canceled, and water poured onto the runways at Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport , both in Queens. Officials made plans to reopen Kennedy, the larger of the two and a major departure point for international flights, on Wednesday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said La Guardia would remain closed “because of extensive damage.” The flooding in the tunnels in Lower Manhattan was so serious that the Federal Emergency Management Agency asked specialists from the Army Corps of Engineers to help. The “unwatering team,” as it is known — two hydrologists and two mechanical engineers from the corps with experience in draining flooded areas — flew to the airport in White Plains because it was one of the few in the area that was open. Buses began running again on Tuesday afternoon, and the mayor ordered a ride-sharing program for taxis. He said more than 4,000 yellow cabs were on the streets by Tuesday afternoon. From southern New Jersey to the East End of Long Island to the northern suburbs in Connecticut, power companies spent Tuesday trying to figure out just how much damage the storm had done to their wires, transformers and substations. The work will take at least a week, possibly longer, because the damage was so extensive, and utility companies called in thousands of crews from all around the country to help out. Consolidated Edison reached to San Francisco to bring in 150 workers from Pacific Gas and Electric. Even with the additional manpower, Con Edison said it could still take more than 10 days to complete the repairs. Con Edison had more than 285,000 customers in Manhattan who were in the dark on Tuesday, and more than 185,000 in Westchester . Things were worse east of New York City, where nearly one million customers of the Long Island Power Authority did not have power on Tuesday and Mr. Cuomo made clear he wanted the authority to restore power faster than it had in the past. He said it was “not O.K.” for it to take two weeks to repair lines brought down by tree limbs. In New Jersey, Public Service Electric and Gas said it had 1.3 million electric customers in the dark, including 500,000 without power because a surge in Newark Bay flooded substations and other equipment. Another New Jersey utility, Jersey Central Power and Light, whose territory covers many shore towns, said almost all of its customers had lost power in some counties, including Ocean and Monmouth. More than one-third of Connecticut Light and Power’s 1.2 million customers had no electricity, either. The fire in Breezy Point, Queens, leveled scores of houses, among them one that belonged to Representative Bob Turner , who was riding out the storm at home despite the mayor’s order to evacuate low-lying areas. Mr. Turner’s spokeswoman, Jessica Proud, said he and his wife made it out safely after flames reached their house. Michael R. Long, the chairman of the state Conservative Party, had a home nearby that also burned down, she said. Flooded streets in the area prevented firefighters from reaching the blaze, a Fire Department spokesman said, and the mayor, who toured the area on Tuesday afternoon, said the neighborhood was devastated. “To describe it as looking like pictures we have seen at the end of World War II is not overstating it,” the mayor said. The off-duty officer who drowned in his basement was identified as Artur Kasprzak, 28, who was assigned to the First Precinct in Manhattan. He had led seven relatives upstairs to the attic as the water rose in his house on Doty Avenue on Staten Island . He said he was going to check the basement and would be right back. About 20 minutes later, one of his relatives called 911 and said he was missing.
(CNN) -- As Hurricane Sandy pushes ashore with top wind speeds of 90 mph, the massive storm has already started walloping residents from Virginia to Massachusetts early Monday, hours before its center is expected to reach shore. The Category 1 hurricane's center is taking aim at southern New Jersey's shoreline and the Delmarva peninsula -- which gets its name from the three states that occupy parts of it: Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. Its center is expected to hit land as early as 8 p.m. ET Monday. Forecasters believe Sandy will collide with a cold front and spawn a "superstorm" that could generate flash floods, snowstorms and massive power outages along the Mid-Atlantic coastline, home to some 50 million people. Governors of the states affected are urging residents to take the threat seriously and make sure they are prepared for the worst. Hurricane-force winds --stronger than 74 mph -- will pummel the coasts of Delaware, New Jersey and New York state, while tropical-storm-force winds between 39 and 73 mph will stretch from North Carolina all the way to Maine. Likely immediate impact: downed power lines and extensive power outages. Forecasters are warning that an "extremely dangerous storm surge" could hit around the same time as high tide, with the highest storm surge along the coasts of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, especially where water funnels into New York Harbor and Long Island Sound. Immediate impact: coastal flooding and beach erosion. Flood-triggering rainfall Heaviest rainfall of up to 8 to 12 inches will be likely on the Delmarva Peninsula and in New Jersey. Immediate impact: Cities such as Dover, Delaware; Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia could see significant flash flooding. Extreme snowfalls totaling several feet will be likely in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia and to a lesser extent into portions of Pennsylvania and Virginia as well. Flight delays With major airlines canceling many flights even ahead of the storm, air travel will be extremely difficult for all of the major Northeastern cities, from Washington through Boston both Monday and Tuesday. Impact: The ripple effect on air travel will be felt worldwide as flights arriving and departing will be canceled or severely delayed. Timing Conditions will be deteriorating along the Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast through the day Monday. Landfall will occur Monday evening into overnight, and storm surge likely will peak around the evening high tide. (Remember Monday's tides are already the largest of the month due to the full moon.) On Tuesday, rain and snow will continue for much of the area, and surf will remain rough as the center of the system slowly drifts northward into Pennsylvania and New York. Delayed impact Because of the size of this system, the effects will be felt far from the center. For example, large waves and surge will be felt in eastern Canada and along the shores of the eastern Great Lakes. Also, when Sandy transitions from hurricane or tropical storm to "post-tropical storm," it does not mean it has weakened or the threat is any less.
Here are some of photographs of Sandy's wrath. Clean-up will take a while, and it's unclear when power or the subways will be back (4-5 days, maybe?).

Read More Hurricane Sandy Paralyzes New York, New Jersey By Andrew Freedman Published: October 30th, 2012 , Last Updated: October 30th, 2012 For years, public officials and coastal residents of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were told that the region is extraordinarily vulnerable to storm surge from nor’easters and hurricanes, but it took Hurricane Sandy, an unprecedented combination of both of those storms, to realize the worst-case scenario on Monday evening. When the storm roared ashore near Atlantic City at 8 p.m. on Monday, it pushed a record high wall of water into Lower Manhattan and coastal New Jersey, flooding parts of Lower Manhattan, including many subway tunnels, splintering the famed boardwalk in Atlantic City, and washing away homes from coastal Rhode Island down to the southern tip of New Jersey. Hurricane Sandy killed at least 33 people in the U.S., knocked out power to more than 7.2 million people — 2.4 million of them in New Jersey alone. It also dumped up to a foot of rain in some places, and buried the higher elevations of West Virginia under 2-to-3 feet of snow. The storm has been unparalleled in meteorological history for its immense geographical scope, the multitude of hazards it unleashed, and the record storm surge it caused. It is almost certain that this storm will wind up being one of the top 10 costliest hurricanes on record, and it comes soon after Munich Re, a global insurance giant, warned of increasing natural disaster losses in the U.S., a trend the company said is related to global climate change. At a Tuesday morning news conference, a weary New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said the damage done to his state is “unthinkable.” “It is beyond anything I ever thought possible,” Christie said, noting that railroad freight cars were tossed onto the New Jersey Turnpike, homes were swept away from their foundations and onto a major coastal road, and rail stations in Hoboken, Secaucus, and Newark were flooded. In New York City, the storm was the most devastating event to happen since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The storm surge at The Battery in Lower Manhattan was the highest ever recorded, and it surpassed even the most pessimistic forecasts, with the maximum water level reaching 13.88 feet above the average of the daily lowest low tide of the month, known as Mean Lower Low Water, including a storm surge component of 9.23 feet. That broke the official record of 10.5 feet above Mean Lower Low Water set in 1960 during Hurricane Donna, as well as a record set during a hurricane in 1821. Or to put this another way, the water level at The Battery rose to 9.15 feet above the average high-tide line. Sandy's record-setting tidal flooding came in at the top end of storm surge forecasts, which were between 6-11 feet in Lower Manhattan. The Wall Street Journal’s Eric Holthaus said that since 1851, only a foot and a half separated the previous top 10 coastal floods in New York City, which includes some of the biggest storms to ever hit the region (Hurricanes Donna and Irene, 1991’s the Perfect Storm, and several major nor’easters). “Sandy's new coastal flood record for New York City is more than 3 feet above the previous record — more than double the range between the previous top 10,” he wrote. Part of the reason the flooding was so significant was that the maximum surge occurred right around the time of high tide. The high water poured into Lower Manhattan from the harbor and the swollen Hudson and East Rivers, with reports of extensive flooding in Battery Park City, the East Village, near Ground Zero, in parts of Brooklyn such as Coney Island, Dumbo, and Red Hook, and Staten Island. Numerous water rescues took place on Monday night, including some at police and fire stations that were located in low-lying areas. Transit officials are just assessing the damage done when corrosive seawater poured into the subway system, one of the city’s biggest fears. Mayor Bloomberg said that it could be several days before service is fully restored. Officials had shut down entire subway system ahead of the storm, which may have helped to minimize lasting damage to electrical equipment. In total, the storm surge, which came on top of the unusually high tide triggered by a full moon, flooded seven subway tunnels under the East River, according to a statement from MTA chief Joseph A. Lhota. “The New York City subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night. Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on our entire transportation system, in every borough and county of the region. It has brought down trees, ripped out power and inundated tunnels, rail yards and bus depots,” Lhota said. “In 108 years, our employees have never faced a challenge like the one that confronts us now. All of us at the MTA are committed to restoring the system as quickly as we can to help bring New York back to normal.” The New York Port Authority is also assessing flood damage at the area’s major airports. At LaGuardia Airport in Queens, the East River overtopped a sea wall and flooded at least parts of the runways, and there were some unconfirmed reports on Monday night that it reached the terminal areas as well, and flooding was also observed at JFK Airport. New York area airports remain closed on Tuesday due to the flooding, since seawater may have damaged runway lights and navigation aids that help aircraft land safely. Sandy Hook, N.J., also saw a record storm surge. The gauge stopped reading there at 8.1 feet above the average high tide level, while the water was still rising. Hurricane Donna in 1960 only reached 5.2 feet above the average high tide. Sandy also generated the third-highest storm surge on record at Philadelphia. The storm, which technically made landfall as a post-tropical cyclone since it was losing the structure of a purely tropical weather system, according to the National Hurricane Center, also brought high winds, heavy rain, and heavy snows to the eastern third of the country. A wind gust of 78 mph was recorded at Newark Airport, 79 mph at JFK, and 96 mph in Eatons Neck, N.Y. Gusts to hurricane force (74 mph or greater) were also recorded from North Carolina to Massachusetts as the storm’s massive circulation -- measuring nearly a thousand miles in diameter -- moved inland. At the time of landfall, the storm had a minimum central pressure of 946 mb, which tied the record for the lowest air pressure reading for any storm to hit the northeastern U.S. An air pressure reading that low is an indication of the storm’s ferocity; the only other northeastern storm that compares was the 1938 hurricane, which killed hundreds of people. Can This Be Blamed on Climate Change? While hurricanes are no stranger to the East Coast, they don’t normally strike so far north this late in the season, since water temperatures are typically too cool to sustain them. However, this year, water temperatures off the East Coast were unusually warm. Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, said that about 1 degree of the several degree water temperature anomaly can be attributed to manmade climate change. In addition to the warmer than average ocean temperatures, the storm also was energized by a powerful jet stream that drove a strong push of Arctic air southeastward from Canada and into the Midwest and Southeast. This jet stream, and the clash of warm and cold air masses, injected the storm with an added dose of energy right before landfall, and helped it transition from a hurricane into a larger nor’easter that was just as strong. At the same time, the upper air flow over the Atlantic Ocean was jammed by a powerful area of high pressure near Greenland and a storm system in the Central Atlantic, leaving the storm no escape route away from the U.S. Satellite image of Hurricane Sandy as it strengthened over the warm ocean waters off the East Coast.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NASA/NOAA. The overall upper air weather pattern that steered Sandy Sandy, and helped it transition into a hybrid storm, is relatively unusual, but not unheard of. The problem is that the pattern is occurred at precisely the wrong time -- when a hurricane was moving out of the Caribbean. Weather Channel hurricane expert Bryan Norcross wrote about this on Oct. 26. “The freak part is that a hurricane happens to be in the right place in the world to get sucked into this doubled-back channel of air and pulled inland from the coast,” he said. “And the double-freak part is that the upper-level wind, instead of weakening the storm and simply absorbing the moisture — which would be annoying enough — is merging with the tropical system to create a monstrous hybrid vortex. A combination of a hurricane and a nor’easter.” Recent studies have shown that strong blocking patterns such as the one that is currently over the Atlantic have appeared with greater frequency and intensity in recent years. Some scientists think that may be related to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which is one of the most visible consequences of manmade global warming. The 2012 sea ice melt season, which ended just one month ago, was extreme, with sea ice extent, volume, and other measures all hitting record lows. The loss of sea ice opens large expanses of open water, which then absorbs more of the incoming solar radiation and adds heat and moisture to the atmosphere, thereby helping to alter weather patterns. Exactly how weather patterns are changing as a result, however, is a subject of active research. Global warming is also expected to alter hurricane frequency and strength, making North Atlantic hurricanes slightly more powerful, while reducing the overall number of storms during coming decades. Detecting such changes in the observational record is difficult, considering the varying ways people have kept tabs on hurricanes prior to the era of hurricane hunter aircraft flights. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that warmer sea surface temperatures are tied to an increase in stronger Atlantic hurricanes. Regardless of any changes in hurricane intensity, storms are already likely to produce more signiifcant coastal flooding, since sea levels have been rising during the past century, due to a combination of warming ocean waters and melting of polar ice caps. If Hurricane Sandy were to strike New York City in 2050, it would cause even more damage, since sea levels are expected to be considerably higher by midcentury. In fact, a recent study found that sea level rise has taken place at an accelerated rate at locations north of Norfolk, Va., and if this pace continues the Northeast could see much higher sea levels than other parts of the East Coast by midcentury.
Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation For New York, the Issue of Steps Not Taken Frank Franklin Ii/Associated PressAwaiting an onslaught: wave activity at Rockaway Beach on Monday morning, when Hurricane Sandy was 425 miles southeast of New York City. With the last hurricane to directly hit New York City dating back to the 1800’s, residents have so far lacked the impetus to demand concrete strategies for dealing with the potential devastation to housing, the subway system and the electrical infrastructure from a major modern-day storm. Now Hurricane Sandy threatens major flooding from a storm surge that could reach up to 14 feet above the average sea level here. Some scientists suggested Monday that once New Yorkers have moved to higher ground and weathered the hurricane, they should begin to take more decisive steps to adapt to more of the same. As I reported last month, pressure has been growing for aggressive action. “We need to figure out how to plug all the holes in the city or build storm surge barriers or both,” said Philip Orton, a research scientist with the Stevens Institute of Technology’s Maritime Security Laboratory in Hoboken, N.J. “We do need to come up with a solution.” Climate scientists say New York can count on more and more severe flooding in the future because coastal waters have risen roughly an inch per decade over the last century as oceans have warmed and expanded. They warn that levels could be two feet higher than is typical today by midcentury. With higher seas, even a common storm could prove as disastrous as the rare big storm like Hurricane Sandy, those experts suggest. If sea levels rose four feet by the 2080’s, a 2011 study commissioned by the state warned, 34 percent of the city’s streets could lie in the flood-risk zone, compared with just 11 percent now. With 520 miles of coast, the city needs to embrace different approaches to address the threat, officials with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s administration say. Already, they have pointed out, the city and partners like Consolidated Edison, which supplies electricity to most of New York City, are incorporating flood-protection measures like elevating high-voltage transformers and other critical equipment above ground level. The city is also expanding wetlands and soft edges to serve as natural barriers and absorb some of the surging tides. But some critics say the city has been spending too much time on research and planning rather than taking actual preventive measures. Whatever happens this week, Hurricane Sandy is likely to renew calls for city officials to quicken the pace of action. Among the avenues supported by critics are seriously considering building sea gates that could close during a storm and block a surge from Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean into the East River and New York Harbor. One proposal, from the Storm Surge Research Group at Stony Brook University, recommends installing movable barriers at the upper end of the East River near the Throgs Neck Bridge, under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and at the mouth of the Arthur Kill between Staten Island and New Jersey. According to this thinking, the barriers would prevent a huge tide from flooding Manhattan and parts of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and New Jersey.But such barriers could cost nearly $10 billion. Other experts are calling for less expensive land-based measures like increasing pumping capacity at subway stations and designing floodgates to block water from entering both the stations and highway tunnels. In the meantime, scientists like Dr. Orton worried Monday afternoon that, with the approaching hurricane posing the potential for a storm surge double the size of Tropical Storm Irene last year, even residents beyond the evacuated zone of the city could be at risk of being flooded out of basement apartments. “It’s not just dangerous in zone A,” Dr. Orton said from his neighborhood on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he was about to set out to advise some building doormen on taking precautions. “People need to find higher ground.” What's Next About How are climate change, scarcer resources, population growth and other challenges reshaping society?

A state-by-state look at what's happened with Hurricane Sandy, and what to expect THE ASSOCIATED PRESS| Oct 29, 2012 | 12:10 PM Corissa Martinez looks out over the Pamlico Sound in Nags Head, N.C. on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2012 as Hurricane Sandy churns up the east coast. (Gerry Broome/AP) Hurricane Sandy is churning off the East Coast and is expected to join up with two other weather systems to create a huge and problematic storm affecting 50 million people. Here's a snapshot of what is happening or expected, state by state. CAROLINAS The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 14 members of a crew forced to abandon a tall ship about 90 miles off the North Carolina coast and continued to search for two other crew members. The storm lashed barrier islands and rendered several homes and businesses nearly inaccessible. CONNECTICUT The number of power outages increased quickly in a state where utilities' response to past weather-related failures has become a political issue. Connecticut Light & Power says hundreds of customers are without power. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy asked a task force to ensure fuel suppliers are fully stocked. Many residents along Long Island Sound heeded warnings and evacuated. DELAWARE Dover Air Force Base has relocated some aircraft in anticipation of the storm, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has requested that the base be used as a staging area for support and supplies. Some residents of low-lying areas of the base have been ordered to evacuate. Sandy is expected to bring snow to far southeastern Kentucky. A winter storm warning is in effect in Harlan, Letcher and Pike counties through Wednesday morning. Forecasters say snow could accumulate from 4 to 10 inches in high elevations and 1 to 3 inches in lower elevations. MAINE Virtually all Maine public schools opened Monday but some were closing early before the heaviest rain and wind from Hurricane Sandy. State officials say the biggest concern is wind, which is expected to cause widespread power outages. The state's utilities say they have crews poised to deal with expected power outages, including some from Canada. MARYLAND Hurricane Sandy inflicted considerable damage overnight to a large, iconic ocean pier in the Maryland beach resort of Ocean City. In mountainous western Maryland, a blizzard warning was issued for sections of Garrett County for Monday night into Tuesday morning. MASSACHUSETTS The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is shutting down all service at 2 p.m. Monday due to expected high winds from Sandy. Secretary of Transportation Richard Davey said the order affects all subway, bus and commuter rail service. NEW HAMPSHIRE Gov. John Lynch declared a state of emergency Monday morning, giving him extra authority to deal with the storm. It also gives the state the opportunity to apply for federal disaster relief. Earlier, Lynch put 100 New Hampshire Guard soldiers on active duty, and utilities secured crews from Canada and a number of states. NEW JERSEY Hurricane Sandy put most of Atlantic City under water Monday and flooed other cities up and down the New Jersey shore as the storm approached for a predicted direct hit to New Jersey. Thousands of people were without power, and some were stranded in homes surrounded by water and had to be rescued. Officials said they expected conditions to get much worse at evening high tide. NEW YORK New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city's public schools will remain closed on Tuesday after being shut down Monday. Earlier, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Holland Tunnel will close at 2 p.m. Monday. Airports in the metropolitan New York City area are open, but air carriers are not operating. Residents of low-lying areas and along Lake Erie were told to watch for flooding; utilities are anticipating high winds that could blow down trees and poles. Snow is forecast in some areas. PENNSYLVANIA Many schools closed. Philadelphia shut down its mass transit system, and hundreds of flights were canceled at the city's airport. Dozens of people took shelter at evacuation centers. Thousands of members of the National Guard have been told to be ready for deployment. Officials are concerned about wind driving water north up Narragansett Bay, which could create flooding in low-lying areas of the upper bay, including Providence, Warwick and Cranston. About 2,600 National Grid customers were without power, mostly in Barrington and other parts of Bristol County. TENNESSEE Snow is expected in higher elevations, where a freeze warning has been issued. High winds are expected in many areas. VERMONT Gov. Peter Shumlin declared a state of emergency to provide access to National Guard troops in a state still recovering from the devastating effects of the remnants of Hurricane Irene. Culverts and storm drainage basins in some spots have been cleared of debris. About 4,800 customers lacked power, and a utility said as many as 1 million could ultimately lose electricity. Many residents of Chincoteague Island, popular with tourists, shrugged off the idea of evacuation. WASHINGTON, D.C. The capital area's transit system shut down rail service for the first time since 2003, and the Smithsonian Institution closed for the day. WEST VIRGINIA As much as 2 to 3 feet of snow was forecast in mountainous areas, and flooding was possible in some areas. At least 14 counties are under a blizzard warning Monday as high winds and heavy, wet snow moves through the state.
Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Prepared for Sandy By the light of day on Tuesday, millions of people in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut looked around at flooded streets and broken trees and realized that this time the official alarms were right. Gov. Dannel Malloy, who closed major highways and begged people to leave the shore, predicted a catastrophe. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York declared a state of emergency three days in advance. A very grim and very tired-looking mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, assessed the city’s widespread damage and said simply, “We expected an unprecedented storm impact here in New York City, and that’s what we got.” Only a day before, there were plenty of people grumbling about the latest nanny-alert from Mayor Bloomberg. Some, in low-lying areas were resisting his pleas to move away from the water. While the skies were still clear, there was grousing about closed tunnels and blocked highways and empty subway stations. People in Atlantic City gambled that the politicians were exaggerating. Some failed to heed the warning from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to leave; and, in his typical combative way, the governor called holdouts “both stupid and selfish.” A few hours later, some of the holdouts were helplessly stranded and needing assistance. Hurricane Sandy was as devastating as meteorologists and political leaders had predicted. At least 39 people have died, a number that could rise as work crews move into flooded coastline areas. The storm wiped out power for roughly eight million people in the mid-Atlantic region. A blizzard connected to the storm suddenly dumped two feet of snow in Appalachia. In Lower Manhattan, much of the financial hub around Wall Street went dark Monday night as water poured into the streets from the New York harbor. Tunnels flooded. Water washed into the subways and surged over the platforms. And despite efforts to move subway cars out of the water’s reach, the damage to the city’s underground tunnels was considerable. While buses and taxis began moving again in New York City on Tuesday, the subways will take longer. The “unwatering” team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency moved into Lower Manhattan to drain the complex substructure under the streets. Cleanup crews began working up and down the coast, from the towns along the New Jersey shore to a devastated stretch of Long Island. Power will return in patches, officials across the region said. Mayor Bloomberg, who was out of the city when a deadly snowstorm hit in 2010, did it right this time. He and the governors issued strong warnings for what turned out to be a dire storm. Now comes the second and harder part, bringing it all back to normal. A version of this editorial appears in print on October 31, 2012, on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Prepared for Sandy. Today's Paper|Subscribe
Hurricane Sandy Information Hurricane Sandy made history as the largest Atlantic hurricane on record when it made landfall near Brigantine, N.J., Oct. 29, 2012. With wind gusts in excess of 75 miles per hour and storm surge that inundated much of the New York and New Jersey coasts with water four to eight feet high, the aftermath proved even worse. Sandy killed at least 117 people in the United States, caused more than $50 billion in damage, and stranded millions of people for days in their homes without electricity, resulting from crippled public transportation systems and severe fuel shortages. Response In the days and weeks following the storm, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mobilized more than 800 personnel from worldwide locations to fulfill Federal Emergency Management Agency mission requests totaling $351 million to assist with the relief and recovery, primarily in New York and New Jersey. The Corps worked closely with its partners to dewater approximately 475 million gallons of salt water, install more than 200 generators to critical facilities such as hospitals and police stations, remove more than 300,000 cubic yards of debris in New York City alone, provide more than nine million liters of bottled water and begin repairs to projects. Recovery In a national commitment to help recover from the second-most costly hurricane in our Nation’s history, Congress in January 2013 passed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013. This act appropriated more than $5 billion to the Army Corps for the restoration and construction of federal projects in the impacted area. One year later, more than 200 projects and studies along the coastline from Florida to Maine and navigation channels inland to Ohio are planned and underway to restore projects to their design-level conditions and reduce the risks of future coastal storm damage. The majority of USACE's recovery program is undertaken in the North Atlantic Division with more than 150 projects and studies totaling more than $4 billion. The Great Lakes and Ohio River Division and South Atlantic Division also were allocated funding to restore coastal storm risk reduction projects and navigation channels in their regions. Resilience Increased resilience to future extreme weather is imperative, especially in the context of climate change, sea-level rise and other factors. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act further allocated $20 million for USACE to collaborate with federal, state, local and tribal partners in academia, government, non-governmental and private industry sectors to complete a comprehensive study to address the flood risks of vulnerable coastal population along 31,000 miles of coastline in the North Atlantic Division’s territory. The report will be delivered to Congress in January 2015. USACE contributed to the Sea Level Rise Tool for Sandy Recovery to create a set of map services to help communities, residents, and other stakeholders consider risks from future sea level rise in planning for reconstruction following Hurricane Sandy. The Corps also collaborated with NOAA to develop Infrastructure Systems Rebuilding Principles to promote a unified strategy for each agency’s approach to activities associated with rebuilding and restoration efforts in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Risk Reduction Risk reduction requires contributions from everyday citizens all the way to the federal government. It involves residents avoiding purchasing homes in flood-prone areas, raising homes that already exist, and insuring appropriately. State and local governments are responsible for appropriate zoning, cost sharing flood risk reduction projects and establishing, promoting and executing evacuation plans. With cooperation of federal partners like FEMA, EPA, DOI and others, USACE implements flood risk reduction measures such as dunes, beaches, barrier islands, levees, sea walls, groins and detached breakwaters to absorb and disburse wave energy. Despite every effort and abundant resources, there still is a degree of risk for the more than 50 percent of Americans who live in coastal regions. Collaborative efforts on all levels continue to explore and implement solution sets that reduce risk from coastal storms.

The study, published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences yesterday, found that a partial collapse in the Antarctic ice sheet would likely exacerbate storm surges and sea level rises in coming storms, making future hurricanes more powerful and Hurricane Sandy-like events more frequent. In fact, researchers found that by 2030 to 2045, storms similar to Hurricane Sandy could increase to a one-in-five-years event, up from a one-in-500-years event in 1800 and a one-in-25-years event today. "Although we do find minimal changes to future storm surge because of a compensation between shifting storm tracks and increasing storm intensity, we find drastic increases to overall flood heights due to rising sea-levels, which we calculate by combining storm surge with potential future sea-levels," lead researcher Andra Garner told the Washington Post. Scientists have previously predicted that should the Antarctic ice sheet melt, global sea levels could see a 3-foot-plus spike. In fact, the future status of the ice sheet has such a profound effect on sea levels that researchers found the flood height in Battery Park during a Hurricane Sandy-type storm could range anywhere from 16.4 to 50.5 feet by 2300—Hurricane Sandy's flood height was at 9.2 feet. Even with the ice sheet remaining stable, sea levels are expected to rise enough to net the city more significant flooding. Indeed, even though some models show hurricanes moving farther away from the city in the future, the ones that do come near us will be much worse than we've traditionally come to expect. "It looks like under all of the main scenarios and models examined, by the end of the century if not earlier, New York would regularly see floods high enough to flood the subway system as engineered today," sea-level-rise expert Benjamin Strauss told WaPo.

One man was killed in a village near rural Kingston when a boulder fell from a hillside and struck his house, crushing him inside. Jamaican authorities closed the island’s international airports and police put a 48-hour curfew in place in an attempt to deter looting. As a result of the dangerous weather, cruise ships change their itineraries to avoid the storm, taking alternative routes. Cuba By the end of Wednesday, hurricane Sandy had reached Cuba, slamming into the south east of the country close to the city of Santiago de Cuba. The eye of the storm came ashore just west of the city with 9 metre waves and a storm surge of around two metres, causing extensive coastal flooding. Cuban officials said that 55,000 people had been evacuated ahead of the storm’s arrival, largely because of the flood risk. Flights were suspended to and from eastern parts of the country, with bus and train services affected by an abundance of cancellations. Tourists were forced to take shelter in their hotels and around 3,000 Cubans working on the coffee harvest in Santiago de Cuba were sent home. Where next for hurricane Sandy? The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center in Miami predicts that Sandy will continue northwards across the Bahamas during Thursday and Friday. Heavy rain will continue to be a concern, with 75-150mm, locally 300mm possible, giving a significant risk of flash flooding. Damaging winds and coastal storm surges are also expected. Further ahead, the forecast has the periphery of the storm taking heavy rain into southern and central parts of Florida, before heading northwards, parallel to the east coast of the US. Whilst still a lot of uncertainty with the detail, there is a possibility that the post-tropical remnants of hurricane Sandy could take some very stormy weather into the north east of the US later this weekend.

UPDATED November 6, 2012 Hurricane Sandy: Covering the Storm A 13-day chronicle of the devastating East Coast storm and its aftermath that killed more than 100 people, destroyed whole communities in coastal New York and New Jersey, left tens of thousands homeless, crippled mass transit, triggered paralyzing gas shortages, inflicted billions of dollars in infrastructure damage and cut power to more than 8 million homes, some of which remained dark for weeks.

Album Description: Over two days on October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy battered New York City's coastline, damaging the city's infrastructure. The City's parks, facilities, and urban forest were all affected by this massive storm. In the wake of Sandy, NYC Parks and other city, state, and federal agencies joined not-for-profit partners and tens of thousands of volunteers to begin the long recovery process.
Photos: Hurricane Sandy Devastated NYC 3 Years Ago Today It was three years ago to the day that Hurricane Sandy clobbered the northeast, killing at least 147 people in the U.S. (48 in NYC) and leaving billions of dollars of devastation in its wake. The storm's surge, a record-setting 14 feet, reached its peak after nightfall on the 29th, and was greatly amplified by high tides brought on by the full moon. When a Con-Ed substation on East 14th Street exploded and caught fire due to flooding, a large swath of Manhattan went dark for five days. Staten Island and the Rockaway peninsula were hit hardest by Sandy when it made landfall, and the flooding caused widespread damage to Red Hook, lower Manhattan, Chelsea, and the subway system. A fire swept through Breezy Point, Queens the night of the surge, destroying over 130 homes. Photographer Tod Seelie documented the devastation in Breezy Point in the immediate aftermath—it looked like a war zone. Three years later, one local estimates that the neighborhood is about 75% rebuilt. This week Mayor de Blasio has been touting the city's rebuilding efforts, noting that when he took office in 2014, the Build It Back program had not yet started construction on anything. Since then, 2,015 construction projects have started (including 1,217 construction completions), and approximately 5,300 reimbursement checks totaling over $100 million have been distributed. At a press conference on Staten Island today, de Blasio announced that the Build it Back single-family home program will be complete by the end of 2016. The city is also implementing a $20 billion climate resiliency plan in an attempt to prepare the city for the next hurricane. Still, the city's infrastructure, particularly the subway system, remains very vulnerable to flooding. And today the Daily News reports that only half of NYCHA buildings damaged by Sandy will receive repair and resiliency funding from FEMA. Photographer Jackson Krule, who was a junior at NYU at the time, took these photos of Rockaway about two weeks after Sandy hit, and returned multiple times. "I had to take a subway to a bus to a bus only to walk the last 1/2 mile," Krule recalls. "There was still damage and debris everywhere. I saw a couple of people on the phone with tears in their eyes talking to their insurance companies...The Boardwalk was completely ripped up. Seeing this I realized how high the water must have been. In Manhattan, where I lived at the time, we only lost power; there wasn't really so much damage. Coming to Rockaway, the damage from Sandy was devastating."

Read More Hurricane Sandy’s Immense Energy Shook the U.S. Sandy, the superstorm that all but submerged New York, was powerful enough to set U.S. earthquake detectors quivering long before it hit the American coastline. It stirred up Atlantic Ocean waves that slammed into each other, started to shake the sea floor and then shook the Midwestern states so vigorously that the storm’s progress could be tracked by seismometer. The windstorm-induced tremors were very tiny, and not unusual – and say as much about the sensitivity of modern seismometers as about the furious forces released in a superstorm. But the episode – revealed at a recent meeting of the Seismological Society of America in Salt Lake City, Utah – is a reminder that the energies released by the dangerous mix of swirling winds and warm oceans are dramatic and, with global warming, could become even more frequent and more devastating. “We detected seismic waves created by the ocean waves both hitting the East Coast and smashing into each other,” said Keith Koper, of the University of Utah seismic stations. And his colleague and fellow author of an as-yet-unpublished study, Oner Sufri, a doctoral student, said “As the storm turned west-northwest, the seismometers lit up.” Sandy began in the Caribbean, developed into a hurricane – the largest Atlantic hurricane on record – and killed 285 people in seven countries, as well as causing an estimated $75 billion in damage. It hit 24 U.S. states and swept into New York on 29 October, by then classified as a superstorm. Biennial superstorms? Hurricanes generate phenomenal energies. One calculation is that the total energy released through clouds and rain during the average hurricane is about 200 times the capacity of all the world’s power stations. Another more graphic calculation is that during its lifespan, the average hurricane releases the energy of 10,000 nuclear bombs. Hurricane Sandy started to shake the sea floor and then shook the Midwestern states so vigorously that the storm’s progress could be tracked by seismometer. Credit: flickr/Jeff Cutler Some of this marine mayhem was picked up by an array of 500 portable detectors called Earthscope. These were first placed in California in 2004, and have been leap-frogging eastwards across the US. When Sandy developed, most of them were located in a band between Minnesota and east Texas, and Lake Erie and Florida. They were designed to tune in, a bit like a doctor’s stethoscope, to the Earth’s crust and the mantle below. Sandy in effect helped geophysicists explore the fabric of the continental U.S. – but the tiny tremors in the crust also told the researchers about the progress of a storm far away. Hurricanes become a predictable hazard as ocean surface temperatures rise, and in 2012 seas off the east coast of the U.S. were unusually warm. Sandy was classified a very unusual event, a once-in-a-century storm, but researchers have warned that, as global temperatures rise, such storms could develop as often as every other year.

It's been almost two weeks since Hurricane Sandy hit the city with storm surges and massive flooding, leaving lots of power outages, transit woes, housing destruction and more problems we're still dealing with now. Below, check out a roundup of Sandy-related links, from the problem of mold to Rihanna lending a hand to another Sandy death. Thick green mold is growing around the South Street Seaport after flooding from Sandy. “Fungus is everywhere. There was bad mold—it was green, an inch thick...I lost everything,” said Shawn Makani, owner of Cafe on the Pier. “We have to wear masks to protect ourselves. It’s dangerous,” said a worker who hauled moldy debris from the Abercrombie & Fitch on Water Street. A 64-year-old man was found dead in the living room of his flooded Staten Island home yesterday. If officials confirm it was a Sandy-related death, it'll be the 42nd death because of the storm in the city. Rihanna donated 1,000 sleeping bags to the Daily News' Sandy relief efforts; she also turned a release party at the 40/40 Club last night into a rally to collect donations and supplies from fans. Also: Rihanna emails the Daily News? Two dentists are suing the owner of the West 57th Street crane that was stuck dangling over midtown after Hurricane Sandy. They're suing for damages incurred from losing a week's worth of business while they were evacuated, and the street below was closed. A 64-year-old Gambino associate claims his house was "whacked" by Sandy, and now he needs FEMA aid: “As a skilled operator of heavy machinery, Mr. Garofalo has been manning equipment—such as a bulldozer—to clear the streets and perform other critical tasks.” Freezing Long Islanders are raging at LIPA for not turning the electricity and heat back on yet. Some Sandy recovery workers who happened to be eating at Eno restaurant in Manhattan when a fire broke out helped put out the flames on two employees. Three people were taken to the hospital with burns altogether. A big concert for Sandy relief, called "12-12-12," is currently being planned by the same people who organized “The Concert For New York” after 9/11. Many NYCHA buildings around the city should get power back this weekend, officials promise—but that doesn't mean they'll actually have power in their individual apartments.

Hurricane Sandy grounds thousands of flights THE ASSOCIATED PRESS| Oct 29, 2012 | 9:49 AM Passengers wait for a flight at at LaGuardia airport on Sunday, Oct. 28, 2012 in New York. (Mary Altaffer/AP) NEW YORK — Hurricane Sandy grounded thousands of flights in the U.S. northeast Monday and upended travel plans across the globe, stranding passengers from Hong Kong to Europe. The massive storm threatens to bring a near halt to air travel for at least two days in a key region for both domestic and international flights. Major carriers such as American Airlines, United and Delta cancelled all flights into and out of three area airports in New York, the nation's busiest airspace. According to the flight-tracking service FlightAware, nearly 7,500 flights had been canceled for Monday and Tuesday, almost all related to the storm. Delays rippled across the U.S., affecting travelers in cities such as San Francisco to Chicago. Disruptions spread to Europe and Asia, where airlines canceled or delayed flights to New York and Washington from cities that are major travel hubs including London, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Businessman Alan Shrem was trying to return home to Boca Raton, Florida. His Monday morning Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to New York's Kennedy airport was canceled. He learned he could be stuck in Hong Kong for nearly a week because the next available seat was Nov. 4. He was put on a waiting list for seats that could become available earlier. "They just say: Yeah, it's a pretty big waiting list," said Shrem, throwing up his hands. In the meantime, he'll have to fork out $400 a night to continue staying at a nearby hotel. The airline won't pay for accommodation for stranded passengers if delays are weather related. Forecasters say Hurricane Sandy is about 310 miles (505 kilometers) southeast of New York City, and the center of the storm is expected to be near the mid-Atlantic coast on Monday night. The National Hurricane Center said early Monday that the storm has top sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph), with higher gusts. Sandy is on track to collide with a wintry storm moving in from the west and cold air streaming down from the Arctic. Airports in the metropolitan New York City area are open, but air carriers are not operating. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said Monday that travelers shouldn't even try to go to Kennedy, Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and Stewart airports Air travel in the Northeast started getting complicated on Sunday, when passengers were reporting multi-hour wait times at airline call centers. Eileen Merberg, 50, was booked on a United flight from her home in Rochester, N.Y. to New Orleans, connecting at Washington D.C.'s Dulles airport. She received an email saying the Washington flight was canceled. United rebooked her first on a flight through Newark and, when that flight was also canceled, on another flight through Chicago. By that point, she already had told the higher education conference that she was scheduled to speak at that she wouldn't be coming. She tried to cancel her flight over the phone. After two lengthy waits — her cell phone battery ran out during the first one — she just hung up. International travelers would have to wait to get to the East Coast of the U.S. All flights from Paris to Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington — a total of 14 — were canceled. Air France has canceled four into JFK and two departures. Frankfurt airport canceled 12 flights, with German carrier Lufthansa scrapping three to the Northeast and one out of Newark. British Airways had to cancel all its flights to and from New York, Newark, Baltimore, Washington DC, Boston and Philadelphia — a total of 20. Eight flights out of Tokyo's Narita International Airport to New York, Newark and Washington were canceled Monday. Hong Kong's Cathay canceled its two daily flights to New York for Monday and Tuesday and Air India said its daily flights to Newark and JFK had halted since Sunday.
Hurricane Sandy slogs toward U.S., 41 killed in Caribbean MIAMI (Reuters) - Hurricane Sandy, a late-season Atlantic cyclone that threatens to be one of the worst storms to hit the Northeast in decades, slogged slowly northward on Friday after killing at least 41 people in the Caribbean. Forecasters said wind damage, widespread and extended power outages and coastal and inland flooding were anticipated across a broad swath of the densely populated U.S. East Coast when Sandy comes ashore early next week. “We’re expecting a large, large storm. The circulation of this storm as it approaches the coast could cover about the eastern third of the United States,” said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Centers for Environmental Prediction. He stopped short of calling Sandy possibly the worst storm to hit the U.S. Northeast in 100 years, as some weather watchers were doing, but said Sandy was shaping up to go down as a storm of “historic” proportions. The late-season hybrid storm has been dubbed “Frankenstorm” by some weather watchers because it will combine elements of a tropical cyclone and a winter storm. Forecast models show it will have all of the ingredients to morph into a massive and potentially catastrophic “super storm.” On its current projected track, government forecasters said, Sandy could make landfall on Monday night or Tuesday in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York or southern New England. In New York City, the global financial hub, officials were considering closing down mass transit before the storm hits. ROMNEY, BIDEN CANCEL TRIPS Coming in the final weeks before the U.S. presidential election on November 6, the storm could throw last-minute campaign travel plans into chaos. An aide to Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney said he had canceled a campaign event scheduled for Sunday night in Virginia Beach, Virginia. President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign announced that Vice President Joe Biden had also canceled a trip to Virginia Beach scheduled for Saturday. Related Coverage The Democratic incumbent was traveling to New Hampshire on Saturday, and on Monday was due to visit Youngstown, Ohio, and Orlando, Florida. Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said he and the head of the U.S. National Hurricane Center had briefed the president on preparations for the storm on Friday morning. “His direction to us again, as always, is to make sure we are prepared to support the states and the governors dependent upon the impacts of the storm,” Fugate told reporters. Much of Florida’s northeast coast was under a tropical storm warning on Friday, and storm watches extended up the coast through North Carolina. Winds and rains generated by Sandy were being felt across much of Florida, with schools closed and air travel snarled in many areas. Sandy weakened to a Category 1 storm as it tore though sparsely populated low-lying southeastern islands in the Bahamas late Thursday, knocking out power and blowing rooftops off some homes. Some further weakening was forecast over the next two days, but the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said hurricane- or tropical-force winds were still likely by the time Sandy hits the U.S. coast. Sandy’s driving rains and heavy winds were blamed for 41 deaths in the Caribbean, where landslides and flash floods were triggered by the cyclone. The Cuban government said Sandy killed 11 people when it tore across the island on Thursday. The storm took at least 26 other lives in deeply impoverished Haiti and four people were killed in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Bahamas. The Haitian dead included a family of five in Grand-Goave, west of the capital Port-au-Prince, killed in a landslide that destroyed their home, authorities said. The Cuban fatalities were unusual for the communist-ruled country that has long prided itself on protecting its people from storms by ordering mass evacuations. The National Hurricane Center said Sandy was about 420 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, late on Friday afternoon, packing top sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km per hour).

REUTERS/Swoan Parker LUNAR TIDE Sandy was forecast to remain a Category 1 hurricane as it completed it passage over the Bahamas late on Friday, sending swirling rains and winds across areas including Florida. It was moving slowly, however, making its final trek across the central and northwest corner of the Bahamas islands at 7 mph. Many forecasters are warning that Sandy could be more destructive than last year’s Hurricane Irene, which caused billions of dollars in damage as it battered the U.S. Northeast. Uccellini said he was reluctant to make comparisons with other storms. But he warned that a full moon on Sunday added to Sandy’s potential for destruction when it comes ashore in the United States. “The lunar tide peaks two days after the full moon, and that’s Monday-Tuesday, which is exactly when the storm will be impacting the coastal areas,” he said. “We’ll have heavy rains and inland river flooding is a real potential here.” Todd Kimberlain said Sandy was somewhat unique because of its integration with the polar trough over the United States. “We went through this same sort of thing back about 20 years ago around Halloween in 1991 with the ‘Perfect Storm,’” Kimberlain said. That storm, featured in a book and movie of that name, combined several different storm systems to ravage the East Coast. A forecast report on Friday from AccuWeather.com predicted “a catastrophic storm” for the Middle Atlantic and Northeast. “It will not be a purely tropical system, with a core of powerful winds near the center, but rather more like a Nor’Easter, with strong winds over a larger area,” the report said.
Here's why 'Frankenstorm' is different Hurricane Sandy, pictured on Sunday, is a massive storm that will be stronger because of a confluence of meteorological factors. (NASA/Getty Images) Stitched together like the monster that gave it a name, the so-called Frankenstorm will be the spawn of a late season hurricane and an early nor'easter — with a full moon just to make things extra scary. Forecasters say an unprecedented confluence of weather conditions will unleash a hybrid hell along the East Coast. - A late-season hurricane, Sandy, is being pushed toward land by a high-pressure system near Greenland. It may not even be a hurricane by the time it hits, but meteorologists say it will still be a massive system with tropical-force winds that could stretch 450 miles. - A winter system coming in from the west is on a collision course with Sandy and will stop it from churning back out to sea. Meanwhile, arctic air from the north will set the stage for up to two feet of snow in some places.
They stepped in the wrong puddle. They walked the dog at the wrong moment. Or they did exactly what all the emergency experts instructed them to do — they huddled inside and waited for its anger to go away. The storm found them all. Hurricane Sandy, in the wily and savage way of natural disasters, expressed its full assortment of lethal methods as it hit the East Coast on Monday night. In its howling sweep, the authorities said the storm claimed at least 40 lives in eight states. They were infants and adolescents, people embarking on careers and those looking back on them — the ones who paid the ultimate price of this most destructive of storms. In Franklin Township, Pa., an 8-year-old boy was crushed by a tree when he ran outside to check on his family’s calves. A woman died in Somerset County, Pa., when her car slid off a snowy road. There were 22 deaths reported in New York City, where the toll was heaviest, and 5 more fatalities elsewhere in the state. Most of all, it was the trees. Uprooted or cracked by the furious winds, they became weapons that flattened cars, houses and pedestrians. But also, a woman was killed by a severed power line. A man was swept by flooding waters out of his house and through the glass of a store. The power blinked off for a 75-year-old woman on a respirator, and a heart attack killed her. And the storm left its share of mysteries. A parking lot attendant was found dead in a subterranean parking garage in TriBeCa, the precise cause unclear. The body of an unidentified woman washed up on Georgica Beach in East Hampton, on Long Island. Some people died and no one knew, not for hours, not until the storm backed away and moved on. * They did what dog owners do. They walked the dog. They were friends living in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. Jessie Streich-Kest and Jacob Vogelman were both 24. Around 8 on Monday evening, during the howling viciousness of the storm, they ventured out with her dog, Max, a white pit bull mix. Ms. Streich-Kest grew up with her family in Prospect Park South and was a teaching fellow. She had just started teaching at the Bushwick School for Social Justice, a high school. She had gone through her first parent-teacher conference last week, and was laughing about it afterward with her parents and their friends. Her father, Jon Kest, is executive director of New York Communities for Change and a longtime activist who has led the battle to unionize carwashes and supermarkets across the city, as well as being a leader in the battle for paid sick days. His daughter was herself a bit of an activist, and helped organize Stop Horse Abuse, which was aimed at the carriage horses in Central Park. In the wind and the rain, the two strode along Ditmas Avenue, a block of old Victorians and similar sprawling homes beneath a canopy of vast maples, oaks and lindens. In rapid succession, perhaps within a space of no more than a half-hour, the brutal winds knocked down three trees. There was a booming sound as one fell. Their roots tore up massive chunks of sidewalk. One of the trees on the south side of the block crushed them. They lay there until Tuesday morning, when their bodies were found. No one realized that the trees had hit anyone. “We had no idea,” said Pat Atia, whose house faces out onto Ditmas Avenue on the block between East 17th and East 18th Streets. “I was outside taking pictures of my house for the insurance when a cop said ‘back up, back up’ and I saw a young man dead under the tree.” Photo Jessie Streich-Kest and her dog, Max. The dog was bruised but survived. Neighbors were caring for him. * She just wanted pictures. In Richmond Hill, Queens, a power line the length of a block on 105th Avenue between 134th and 135th Streets snapped and crumpled to the ground. The frayed end of the line began sparking wildly. Around 8 on Monday night, a 23-year-old woman who lived at the end of the block came out to her driveway clutching a camera. Her name was Lauren Abraham, and she went by Lola. She was a makeup artist who worked for several professional agencies. She maintained a makeup studio in the basement of the house, which her parents owned. The third floor was vacant, and so she used it as a makeshift photography studio for shots to advertise her makeup skills. She was attending beauty school, but had also been studying at Lehman College to become a social studies teacher. Elpidio Nunez, a close friend for 10 years, said she was passionate about making her friends look gorgeous before a night out at the clubs. “She was a beautiful girl, very carefree, she was never depressed,” Mr. Nunez said. “I had never seen her cry.” Tamica Penn, 22, her best friend, said, “If you ever needed to talk, she would be there.” The two had spoken at 7 p.m., an hour before she went outside to take her pictures of the downed power line. You are already subscribed to this email. A half-dozen or so witnesses watched in utter horror. They said her body burned for about a half-hour before the police and firefighters arrived. Mr. Nunez woke up in the middle of the night. He had a sick feeling that something was very wrong. He sent text messages to his good friend over and over to see if she was all right. Nothing came back. They did what they were supposed to, what they thought would get them safely through it. North Salem in upper Westchester County is horse country, and it has estates owned by the well-off, but it is mainly a working-class town dotted with winterized bungalows. Jack Baumler, 11, was a sixth grader known as a star shortstop in the local Little League. Michael Robson, 13, was his best friend and neighbor down Bonnieview Street. Valerie Baumler, Jack’s mother, had a wood-frame cottage along Peach Lake, and the boys were spending the night together, along with two other boys. Photo Lauren AbrahamCredit Elpidio Nunez They were watching television, the winds pounding outside, when the hurricane uprooted an enormous tree. It ripped through the roof of the compact cottage. Jack and Michael were killed. The two other boys escaped with mild injuries. Ms. Baumler was unhurt. “We lost two beautiful young boys last night,” said Mr. Seymour, choking back tears outside the Baumler house. “Our hearts are broken; the pain is raw. We believe faith will carry us through. North Salem has a huge heart and they will wrap their arms around these two families.” Mr. Seymour was helping neighbors clear out the furnishings of the house. It was so severely damaged that a local policeman guarding the street said it may have to be demolished. On Tuesday morning, the tree was still deeply wedged into the cottage. * They did not want to get robbed. Michael Abruzzo, 43, had lived for several years across the street from George Dresch and his family at the end of Yetman Avenue on Staten Island. The families attended the same church. They had each other’s back. “Good people” is how Mr. Abruzzo summed them up. “They watched our dog every time we went on vacation.” Mr. Abruzzo, an electrician who had lived in the neighborhood for a decade, saw Mr. Dresch on Monday. Heeding warnings, Mr. Abruzzo had evacuated with his wife and two daughters on Sunday. He had returned to his house briefly to tackle some final chores. Mr. Dresch told him that he, his wife, Pat, and their daughter, Angela, were going to sit out the storm. They weren’t going anyplace. The body of Angela Dresch, 13, was found about 100 yards from her house. Her mother was found, alive, a block to the north, and has been hospitalized. George Dresch is missing. On Tuesday afternoon, rescue workers spied a male body trapped in debris sandwiched between two nearby houses. They were trying to remove it so they could identify it. “I was just with him,” Mr. Abruzzo said in disbelief. “I told him to get out.” Correction: November 1, 2012 An article on Wednesday about deaths attributed to Hurricane Sandy, using information from New York City officials, misstated the age of one victim, Jacob Vogelman of Brooklyn.

Read More NWS Confirms Sandy Was Not a Hurricane At Landfall By Andrew Freedman Published: February 12th, 2013 , Last Updated: February 12th, 2013 In a technical report released on Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reaffirmed its initial conclusion that Hurricane Sandy was no longer officially a hurricane when it made landfall on Oct. 29 near Brigantine, N.J., just north of Atlantic City. Instead, it was a “post-tropical cyclone” packing hurricane-force winds, the report said. However, it also said that hurricane-force winds reached the New York coastline while the storm was still a hurricane, and that storm surge fatalities may have occurred while Sandy was officially a hurricane as well, raising additional questions about why no hurricane warnings were issued for any locations north of North Carolina.

The tropical cyclone report brings an end to any debate within NOAA over whether or not the storm still had sufficient characteristics of a tropical weather system to hold on to the hurricane label at landfall. The classification of the storm carries significant implications for home and business owners, as well as insurers, since most hurricane insurance policies have deductibles that would have been triggered only if the storm still had been a named hurricane at the time of landfall, and if hurricane warnings were in effect. In this case, neither one of those conditions were met. The storm is expected to be the second-most expensive storm on record in the U.S. since 1900, with damage in excess of $50 billion, behind only Hurricane Katrina. The report provides the most in-depth summary of the storm’s evolution, structure, and impacts to date, and includes a comprehensive list of storm surge and inundation observations. It depicts a storm that had “quite unusual” hybrid characteristics that amplified its destructive power in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, particularly its large wind field, which powered a record storm surge that inundated large portions of the coastline from Delaware to Massachusetts. Anticipating the storm’s transition into a post-tropical storm, the National Weather Service (NWS) never issued hurricane watches or warnings north of North Carolina, which has proven to be a controversial decision. Critics, including some prominent television weathercasters, have questioned this decision by pointing out that more people might have heeded evacuation orders had hurricane warnings been put in place. The report provides some ammunition for those critics, particularly with its conclusion that it is possible that some storm surge-related deaths may have occurred before Sandy officially made its transition from a hurricane. “. . . it is nearly impossible to know exactly when these deaths occurred relative to the transition,” the report said. Before Hurricane Sandy made its trek up the eastern seaboard, computer model projections showed that it would likely remain a hurricane for a time, but then transition to an extratropical storm system before making landfall. Since the Weather Service has different procedures and warning criteria for different types of weather systems, forecasters were faced with “unprecedented forecast and warning challenges,” the report said. A purely tropical weather system mainly taps warm ocean waters for its strength, and has the strongest winds and rain closest to the center of the storm. An extratropical system, on the other hand, draws its power from large-scale temperature contrasts between warm and cold air masses, and has a far broader wind field and frontal features, such as cold and warm fronts. Instead of risking a situation in which the Weather Service would have had to change its warnings at the last minute, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) directed local branch offices of the NWS to issue a hodgepodge of warnings, such as high-wind warnings, while refraining from issuing hurricane watches or warnings.

The warnings that were issued may have affected the public’s decision-making process and public officials’ responses, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s initial press conference, when he told New Yorkers not to expect hurricane-like impacts from the storm. (Bloomberg later ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying parts of the city.) “We would have liked to have been able to put up a hurricane warning,” said James Franklin, chief of forecast operations at the Hurricane Center in Miami, in an interview. “[But] looking at it two to three days in advance we thought there were some really, really bad things that could have happened had we gone with the hurricane warning.” Dropping hurricane warnings during the middle of the event would have been interpreted as “the all-clear” by many people, Franklin said. “We also knew in making decision that this was one of the most hyped up and publicized systems ever, probably, so we felt as though the message of a hazardous, life-threatening event was going to get out, and we made a lot of efforts to make sure that message would get out” regardless of the types of warnings that were issued, he said. The NWS is considering two proposals that would give the Hurricane Center more flexibility to issue hurricane warnings if a similar situation arises. Franklin said that the Weather Service uses a three-part definition to determine if a storm meets the necessary conditions for being classified as a tropical weather system or an extratropical one. In order to be a tropical system, such as a hurricane, Franklin said, it must have a warm core — meaning that the air near the storm’s center needs to be warmer than the air outside the core of the storm — it needs to have organized deep thunderstorms associated with it, and it needs to be free of warm and cold fronts, which are typical features of non-tropical weather systems. In Sandy’s case, shortly before the storm made landfall it did have a warm core, but it failed to meet the other two requirements. “We’re very comfortable with saying it was not a tropical cyclone after 5 p.m. on the 29th,” Franklin said. “It simiply didn’t meet the definition.” The report said that the storm caused 72 direct deaths in the U.S., which was the most from any U.S. cyclone since Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972. A majority of the deaths occurred as a result of storm surge flooding, including 21 surge-related deaths in low-lying sections of Staten Island alone, where an evacuation order had been issued by Bloomberg. The report said that Staten Island and portions of Manhattan, along with hard-hit areas of the Jersey Shore, saw inundation levels of 4-to-9 feet above ground level. At the Battery in Lower Manhattan, the storm tide of 14.06 feet above Mean Lower Low Water, was 4.36 feet higher than the previous record. The report also found that flooding occurred 100 nautical miles north of New York City, in Columbia and Greene Counties, due to the storm surge up the Hudson River. The storm damaged or destroyed 650,000 houses, and caused about 8.5 million customers to lose power. It caused “unprecedented” catastrophic damage to the New Jersey shore, and an estimated $19 billion in damage to New York City alone. The tropical cyclone report is separate from an ongoing assessment of NOAA’s performance prior to, during, and after Hurricane Sandy.
Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Worrying Beyond Hurricane Sandy It is small comfort to sodden and stranded New Yorkers that Hurricane Sandy’s flooding of the city’s infrastructure, from power lines to subways to low-lying communities, was predicted in grimly precise detail by scientists in the latest state and city climate studies. Deeper and more frequent flooding from Rockaway to Lower Manhattan and the city’s transit tunnels has been a repeated warning that largely went unnoticed by the public and most politicians. But now, with the floods from Sandy and Tropical Storm Irene last year on his watch, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pointedly stressing what he considers the inevitability of more such disasters. “Climate change is reality,” the governor said Wednesday, estimating Sandy’s economic damage up to $6 billion. “Given the frequency of these extreme weather situations that we’ve had — and I believe that it’s an increasing frequency — for us to sit here today and say this is a once-in-a-generation and it’s not going to happen again, I think would be shortsighted.” Mr. Cuomo admits that he does not have all the answers nor enough government money for all the proposed solutions. And we can all hope that he is wrong in his forecast. But the urgency of his warning is rooted in a basic fact of nature underpinning the government studies: New York’s coastal waters, which rose an inch per decade in the last century, are heading toward rates of 6 inches per decade as the oceans warm and expand. That would be a disastrous rise of 2 feet across the next 40 years, for anyone planning ahead. And there aren’t many in government planning ahead as the postrecession political debate grinds along the question of how to slash government improvements, not expand them. Just last September, Klaus Jacob, an adviser to the city on climate change, warned of the certainty of flooded Manhattan highways and tunnels and of stranded subway riders and subway commuters if the next storm surge topped Irene’s. “I’m disappointed that the political process hasn’t recognized that we’re playing Russian roulette,” said Mr. Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute and an author of a 2011 state study that predicted tens of billions in economic losses from worsening floods. This is why the problem underlined by Mr. Cuomo deserves heightened public debate. Mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed. "What’s clear is that the storms that we’ve experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are much more severe than before,” the mayor said. “Whether that’s global warming or what, I don’t know. But we’ll have to address those issues.” Mr. Cuomo proposed consideration of the sort of storm surge barriers in use in Europe. Gates like those guarding London’s riverfront could be closed in disastrous weather at three main points of ocean inflow — the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the upper East River and the mouth of the Arthur Kill between Staten Island and New Jersey. This idea and others involve billions of dollars, which could be a bargain if Sandy and Irene truly are harbingers of more frequent disasters eating deeper into the city’s heart. The governor offered far more welcome words in an announcement that limited parts of mass transit would go back on line. But he did not and should not retreat from his climate agenda, even if a surge in political resolve is lacking. “I don’t think most people would agree with me at this point,” Mr. Cuomo said. “First, you have to convince the citizenry, then get the elected officials to move.” A version of this editorial appears in print on November 1, 2012, on Page A30 of the New York edition with the headline: Worrying Beyond Hurricane Sandy.

“All of this was hit pretty hard,” said Kai-Uwe Bergmann, sweeping his arm from the East River toward the looming sprawl of the Baruch Houses, a public housing complex that sits along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive on the Lower East Side. “If another storm hits here in the future, it will be just as bad, probably worse.” Mr. Bergmann’s job is to ensure that it doesn’t happen. As a partner at the Bjarke Ingels Group, a Danish architecture firm, he is one in a cast of hundreds trying to fortify New York against another storm like Hurricane Sandy, which ripped through the region two years ago this week. In the storm’s aftermath, there were calls for a single big fix, like sea gates that would close off New York Harbor to swells of rising water. But the solutions being tried out now are more widespread, and humbler, including stone revetments on Coney Island Creek to prevent “backdoor” flooding, and solar-powered streetlights on the East 12th Road boardwalk in Broad Channel, Queens, which is often flooded, even by lesser storms. While only a few of the smallest projects have been finished, the vast constellation of proposals — backed by what one official called a “strange polyamorous relationship” of the city, state and federal governments — will most likely take years and billions of dollars to complete, if indeed that is ever achieved. If there is one guiding principle at work, it is the notion that the city, which has thumbed its nose at the water for 300 years, can no longer keep the sea at bay, but must by necessity invite it in. “We didn’t want to just build barriers; we wanted to build an ecosystem,” said Henk Ovink, a Dutch water-management expert who now serves as a senior adviser to the Presidential Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, a group within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has earmarked billions for the program. “For that to happen, we have to live with the water, to understand it, while still understanding our vulnerabilities.” In the next four decades, scholars say, sea levels are expected to rise by as much as 30 inches, and if the worst projections come to pass, about 800,000 city residents could find themselves living with the threat of being swamped. According to an insurance report commissioned by the city, if New York suffers another storm like Sandy in the early 2050s, when ocean levels and the population are likely to be higher, it could cause $90 billion in damage — almost five times the cost of the initial storm. Mr. Ovink described the effort to rethink New York as “the love child of Jane Jacobs and Robert Moses,” meaning that it merges the granular approach of Ms. Jacobs, an advocate of small, vibrant neighborhoods, and the sweeping vision of Mr. Moses, an urban planner of Pharaonic scale and scope. Image Volunteers planting sea grass on a dune built to protect Breezy Point, Queens, on the first anniversary of Hurricane Sandy.CreditAdrees Latif/Reuters It is, if nothing else, enormous, comprising the construction of sea walls and bulkheads, beach replenishment, the creation of parks as buffer zones, the retrofitting of apartment buildings, commercial structures and single-family homes, and the redesign of power stations, subway tunnels, sewage treatment plants, hospitals, utility poles and even ordinary streets. “In terms of size,” said Daniel Zarrilli, the director of the 8-month-old Mayor’s Office of Recovery and Resiliency, “you’d have to look back to the rebuilding after the San Francisco earthquake for any real comparison,” referring to the 1906 disaster. New York has been here before. In the 1960s, after Hurricanes Carol and Donna, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed building barriers at Throgs Neck in the Bronx and at the Narrows. In later years, there were plans for a giant swinging gate at the mouth of Jamaica Bay and a 15-foot, steel-and-concrete wall to run the length of Coney Island. None of these projects was ever undertaken, because of environmental concerns and a lack of financing. But this time, some of the money has already been set aside, suggesting that things might finally be different. While the state and federal governments have their own plans, the city’s blueprint, the Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency report, released last year by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, set forth 257 projects to be finished in a decade. In April, the new administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio updated the so-called SIRR report, announcing that while most of the projects were “in progress,” the city had in the intervening months completed efforts like reinforcing beaches in the Rockaways and had reached an agreement with Consolidated Edison under which the utility would flood-proof its equipment without increasing rates. The abiding question, of course, is whether the city will really be prepared next time. “The short answer is, we’re getting there in an impressive fashion,” said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a construction trade group, which, like many private organizations, issued its own plan on how to make the city more resilient. “Agencies at the federal, state and city levels are all responding, but the deeper issue is how much further we still have to go.” The Big U Seven months after Hurricane Sandy, Shaun Donovan, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, asked Mr. Ovink to oversee an international design competition meant to elicit innovative plans to protect New York against the next big hurricane. What resulted was Rebuild by Design, which this spring awarded money to government officials to implement six plans from architects and engineers chosen from a pool of 148 proposals. Among their proposals: a network of levees, a waterfront greenway and a new power plant to protect the Hunts Point food market in the Bronx, and the planting of oyster beds and reefs off Staten Island’s shore to mitigate the destructive force of oncoming waves. Image Part of a proposed eight-mile series of coastline defenses, called the Big U, that would wrap the bottom of Manhattan with 10-foot-tall berms meant to guard the edges of the island, while blending into a newly imagined string of waterfront parks.CreditRebuild by Design But the most ambitious of the plans is the one put forth by Mr. Bergmann’s firm, which proposed constructing an eight-mile series of linked defenses wrapped like a chin strap around the coastline of Manhattan from West 57th Street south to the Battery and up the East Side to 42nd Street. Called the Big U, the project relies mainly on 10-foot-tall slurry-filled, earth-topped berms meant to guard the edges of the island, acting as a barrier to water while blending into a newly imagined string of waterfront parks. “The idea was to create a public amenity that also had a protective element,” Mr. Bergmann said. “We could have built walls, but walls are only used .01 percent of the time, during crises. We wanted something that was aesthetically pleasing, well designed and was useful all the time.” In Battery Park, for instance, the plan calls for a series of “upland knolls” where people could sunbathe, garden or even farm most of the time. During a storm, the built-up landscape would fend off the sea. Could it actually be built? The Big U’s first so-called compartment, running along the East River from 23rd Street to Montgomery Street on the Lower East Side, is expected to break ground in 2017 and be finished three years later. The federal government has given the city $335 million to implement the first section of the BIG U that will serve as a test case for the still-unfunded portions of the project on the West Side and in Lower Manhattan. 90,000 Buildings at Risk From seaside bungalows in Staten Island to Wall Street offices with harbor views, nearly 70,000 buildings in New York sit within the 100-year floodplain, meaning that in any given year they have a 1 percent chance of being swamped. According to the city, that total could increase in the next 10 years, because of rising seas, to almost 90,000 buildings, an area encompassing 660 million square feet (almost 24 square miles) and housing more than 440,000 people. To protect this population, the city late last year introduced 21 changes to the zoning and building codes, 16 of which have been adopted. (Local Law 99, for instance, makes it easier to elevate fuel-storage tanks and telecommunications systems.) Then this month, the City Planning Department published a 57-page guide, “Retrofitting Buildings for Flood Risk,” with instructional case studies on various building types: bungalows, attached two-family homes with garages, mixed-use mid-rise walk-ups. Image Flood waters at West and Cortlandt Streets in Lower Manhattan in September 1960.CreditAllyn Baum/The New York Times “The mayor and the City Council have been very serious about protecting New York’s building stock,” said Russell Unger, executive director of the Urban Green Council, an advocacy group for sustainable building, which last year helped convene the 200-member Building Resiliency Task Force. “You’d be hard-pressed find any other city responding so quickly to a disaster like this.” In June 2013, Mr. Unger’s task force issued a report with 33 recommendations to make the city’s buildings more robust against an event like Hurricane Sandy, including a plan to redesign tall, exposed structures to better handle wind, and proposed legislation to require sinks and toilets in commercial and residential buildings to work without power. Of the 33 suggestions, the city has carried out half. “It’s an extraordinary record,” Mr. Unger said. In September, Mayor de Blasio announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had given the city $108 million to install backup generators, elevated boilers and new flood-barrier systems at the Coney Island Houses, a five-building public housing project that was inundated during the storm, leaving its 1,400 residents without heat or power for 22 days. The work in Coney Island is meant to serve as the model for a continuing collaboration between FEMA and the New York City Housing Authority to reinforce 15 other public housing projects damaged by the storm. Plugging the Holes After Hurricane Sandy dumped untold tons of water into the Montague Tunnel, a subway tube connecting Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, engineers at New York City Transit faced a daunting problem: how to redesign a subterranean system in a coastal city and keep the water out. The answer, said John O’Grady, vice president for infrastructure and facilities at the transportation agency, was to plug the system’s holes: vent bays, manholes, station entrances, access hatches and emergency exits. At South Ferry alone, Mr. O’Grady said, the agency was forced to design — and will eventually install — coverings for more than 500 openings: from simple sliding panels to custom-made collapsible metal traps. “We had to make some changes,” said Matt Sniffen, the utility’s chief engineer for electrical distribution. Among those changes are plans to build higher walls and flood-proof concrete barriers at its 14th Street-East River substation, which exploded during Sandy; to install submersible equipment in areas prone to floods; to build new utility poles able to withstand winds of up to 110 miles per hour; and to bury more than 30 miles of overhead power lines in the five boroughs and in Westchester County by 2016. Like Con Ed, the city’s hospitals — both public and private — have undertaken a collage of resiliency efforts. At NYU Langone Medical Center, which suffered nearly $1 billion in damage from the storm, engineers have already raised the electrical systems out of the reach of floods and plan to protect their underground fuel-oil storage tanks with pumps and waterproofing, said Paul Schwabacher, the senior vice president for facilities management. They are also working on a new emergency generator plant for the hospital’s main building, expected to be ready by 2016. In July, the hospital announced that it would receive $1.13 billion in recovery aid from FEMA, the second-largest award for a single project ever granted by the agency. With some of that money, NYU Langone, whose employees evacuated patients on stretchers during the storm, will soon conduct an executive-level hurricane drill. Teaching Resiliency While most of the resiliency projects have focused on hardware — sea walls, bulkheads and the like — officials have not lost sight of the fact that people, too, need help in preparing for the future. A few months after Hurricane Sandy, the state created the New York Rising program, which called on leaders in hard-hit communities to come up with plans to assist their own residents. So far, 15 communities have been chosen to receive more than $200 million in federal money through New York Rising, in grants of between $3 million and $25 million each. In the adjoining Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brighton Beach, Coney Island, Manhattan Beach and Sea Gate, for example, community leaders have proposed the creation of a vocational high school that would teach students resiliency, sustainability and emergency preparedness skills. In Howard Beach, Queens, near Kennedy Airport, leaders have recommended creating a public education program to help homeowners and business people get technical training and counseling on how to make their property more resilient. After determining that nearly all of the businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy were enterprises of 50 employees or fewer, the city gave out $23 million in loans and grants, and nearly $3 million in tax breaks to 650 small businesses across the five boroughs. It is now in the final stages of preparing a centralized effort for small commercial ventures: the Business Resiliency Investment Program, a $110 million plan to help small businesses invest in improvements that could include flood-proofing warehouses, creating emergency plans or devising computerized systems to back up crucial data.

Will the city be better able now to withstand a big storm than it was two years ago? The consensus among architects, engineers, academics and urban planners is a qualified yes. “We will do better against the next storm,” said Judith Rodin, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which helped to finance the Rebuild by Design competition. “The problem is that the next disaster may be nothing like Hurricane Sandy. It could be an awful heat wave, for example, in which case what we’ve done will do little to protect us.” Instead of separate, interlocking efforts by city, state and federal officials, Dr. Rodin recommended a single plan that would take advantage of the untapped powers of the city’s business community and capital markets. In San Francisco, she said, municipal officials have developed a broad-based plan against mudslides, drought and earthquakes, involving traditional corporations like Comcast and Pacific Gas and Electric, as well as those from the local sharing economy like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. “We haven’t sufficiently engaged the private sector yet, which is a huge piece of the puzzle,” Dr. Rodin said. “As for the markets, there’s a lot of money sitting on the sidelines that could be brought into building resilient infrastructure.” To other experts, the key to making the city more resilient is not more money, but the understanding that disasters like Hurricane Sandy are not caused by nature alone, but by human beings, too. In the introduction to its “Post-Sandy Initiative” report, the American Institute of Architects noted that damage from the storm was worsened by “centuries of misguided development policies.” The report contends: “We must recognize that much of the problem lies in our own culpability as a client society — the way we have helped over the years to create a susceptible built environment.” At the center of this culpability is what Ted Steinberg, a professor of history and law at Case Western University and the author of “Gotham Unbound: the Ecological History of Greater New York,” calls the “growth imperative” — the misbegotten notion that the city can endlessly expand without repercussion. “The driving force behind New York has always been limitless growth,” Professor Steinberg said. “But the unpleasant truth is that for all its wealth and development, New York is still vulnerable.” During the Bloomberg era, Professor Steinberg said, almost 40 percent of the city was rezoned for population growth, much of it along the waterfront. Even now, there are ambitious plans afoot to continue building in low-lying areas. The Hudson Yards project, on the Far West Side of Manhattan, has been designed within the 100-year floodplain. And the Two Trees apartment complex in the old Domino Sugar factory in Brooklyn sits directly on the banks of the East River. While city officials say building on the water can be accomplished safely through the use of new technologies and stringent building codes, Professor Steinberg argued that projects such as these evinced a kind of “environmental machismo.” “We need to retreat, especially intellectually,” he said, “from the idea that we can keep on building anywhere we want. New Yorkers are tough. They can take whatever nature throws their way. But you just can’t grow forever at the expense of the sea.” Correction : An article last Sunday about New York’s plans for coastal defenses because of Hurricane Sandy described incorrectly the funding for six proposals chosen through Rebuild by Design, an international contest soliciting ways to protect the city. The money for the proposals, including one called the Big U, came from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and was given to government officials. It did not come from Rebuild by Design, and it was not given to the teams behind the winning plans.

Report Cites Large Release of Sewage From Hurricane Sandy A view of Breezy Point, Queens, from November. Hurricane Sandy brought sewage-filled floodwaters to the neighborhood.Credit Robert Stolarik for The New York Times Over 10 billion gallons of raw and partly treated sewage gushed into waterways and bubbled up onto streets and into homes as a result of Hurricane Sandy — enough to cover Central Park in a 41-foot-high pile of sludge, a nonprofit research group said in a report released on Tuesday. The group, Climate Central, said about 94 percent of the sewage flowed into rivers, canals and bays in New York and New Jersey, the states hit hardest by the storm that came ashore six months ago. In New York City alone, 1.6 billion gallons spilled into area waterways. Alyson Kenward, the principal author of the report, said in a teleconference that rising seas and strengthening storms, a result of climate change, could increase the threat of similar spills in the future. She urged an overhaul of the region’s wastewater infrastructure. Hurricane Sandy exposed serious shortcomings in the region’s infrastructure. Dunes were breached, and subway lines and tunnels were flooded. After the storm, gasoline was often difficult to find, and electricity in some places was out for weeks. To remain operational, treatment facilities must continuously cycle water, bringing in untreated waste and expelling cleaned water into rivers and canals. Hurricane Sandy’s storm surge swamped motors and shorted out electrical equipment in some plants, halting the flow and forcing sewage to back up and leak. Other facilities were simply overwhelmed by the volume of water coming through the system. Water pumps and other equipment at the Bay Park sewage treatment plant in East Rockaway, N.Y., in Nassau County, had to be replaced after they were flooded by the storm.Credit Uli Seit for The New York Times The group collected data provided by government agencies and plant operators from eight states affected by Hurricane Sandy, as well as from the District of Columbia. In New York, the Bay Park Sewage Treatment Plant on Long Island was probably the hardest hit, according to the report. As much as 2.2 billion gallons of partly treated sewage poured into the Rockaway Channel until the plant was fully brought online nearly two months after the late-October storm, the report said. Over a billion gallons of untreated sewage flowed into the Hudson River from the Yonkers Joint Wastewater Treatment plant, in Westchester County. Michael Martino, a spokesman for the Nassau County Department of Public Works, said the Bay Park plant began processing and partially treating sewage within 40 hours after it shut down and was fully compliant with regulations by mid-December. On average, Mr. Martino said, the plant processes 52 million gallons a day. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Permanent repairs to the plant are expected to cost $600 million, including the cost of raising pumps and motors and other measures to protect against future storms, he said. Officials plan to spend another $400 million to $800 million to improve defenses for wastewater facilities countywide. In the majority of cases, the report said, storm surge was responsible for the damage. But in Washington, it was heavy rainfall that overwhelmed one treatment plant, causing 475 million gallons of contaminated runoff and untreated sewage to flow into the Anacostia River. The damage has run into the billions of dollars. In New York, Gov.Andrew M. Cuomoinitially estimated that about $1.1 billion would be needed to repair treatment plants. The environmental impact has been more difficult to evaluate. Currents and tides most likely flushed out much of the sewage in local waterways, experts say, though some regions imposed bans on shellfish and issued boil-water alerts in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The report said that raising water pumps and electrical equipment and installing watertight doors and windows could bolster treatment facilities against storm surges and torrential downpours. Any changes will be extremely expensive, and with sea levels rising and weather patterns changing, it is unclear what can be done to eliminate the dangers, Dr. Kenward said. “These facilities do have to be close to the water,” she said, “and they are inherently always going to be vulnerable to coastal flooding.” A version of this article appears in print on May 1, 2013, on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Report Cites Large Release Of Sewage From Hurricane.

If you were listening to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's press briefing Tuesday (Oct. 30) as New York City began to tally the damage from Hurricane Sandy, you may have been surprised by what you heard. "There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a political statement. That is a factual statement," Cuomo said. " Anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns, I think, is denying reality." Yesterday he added, "I think part of learning from this is realizing that climate change is a reality." Former President Bill Clinton told a crowd Tuesday: "All up and down the East Coast, there are mayors ... being told, 'You've got to move these houses back away from the ocean. You've got to lift them up. Climate change is going to raise the water levels on a permanent basis. If you want your town insured, you have to do this.'" Add to the mix Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who endorsed Barack Obama for president on Thursday (Nov. 1), saying Obama is the better candidate to deal with climate change, which he said may have contributed to the superstorm. High-profile figures like Bloomberg, Cuomo and Clinton speaking candidly and practically about climate change suggests a change of pace among public officials. But will the dialogue on extreme weather and climate that has emerged in Sandy's wake alter the national conversation (or lack thereof) on climate change? Or will that discussion recede with Sandy's floodwaters and the week's news cycle? Experts don't have the answer to that question. They do say, however, that climate change had at least some influence. "This was a complex storm, so we do need to be cautious about linking it to climate change," said Jonathan Foley, an ecosystem researcher who is director of the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment. "Only some of its components may have been due to climate change." The storm had several ingredients, Foley explained. Sandy's late-season formation may have been influenced by a shifting climate, but its meet-up with an early North American winter storm had no climate change connection. A high-pressure blocking event, which may have been climate change-related, steered the storm toward the East Coast rather than out to sea. Unusually high tides amplified Sandy's storm surge and flooding, but the tides had nothing to do with climate change. And the fact that those four events happened simultaneously was just an unfortunate coincidence. Warmer temperatures, which allowed the storm to carry more moisture, and higher sea level are likely to have amplified Sandy and its effects, said Michael Mann, a climate researcher at Pennsylvania State University. The 13-foot (4 meters) coastal surge, which includes both storm surge and high tide, in New York City's Battery Park was the highest in at least two centuries. The higher sea level — a foot higher than when the city's protective sea walls were built a century ago — can be attributed to climate change, Mann said. "Someone set the fire with meteorology, but climate change added the fuel," Foley said. Sandy and the climate conversation The message that climate change did play a role in Hurricane Sandy isn't getting the attention it should, Mann said. "The climate change discussion needs a tipping point — I call it a Cuyahoga River moment," Mann said, referring to the polluted Ohio river that caught fire in 1969 and sparked an environmental movement. [Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted] Foley agreed. "We're having the same conversation we've been having since the 1988 drought, the 1993 floods, Hurricane Katrina, the heat waves in Europe. Public attention seems to max out at a couple weeks." Many have noted the near-absence of a climate discussion in the 2012 presidential race. Foley said that's not surprising because it's a no-win proposition for both candidates. President Barack Obama already is seen having the support of most voters who are concerned about climate change, and the matter doesn't seem to be a major concern for Mitt Romney's supporters. "When one political party has the official position that climate change is a hoax, when we're politically divided as to whether we should even accept the science, it's difficult to have a meaningful discussion," Mann said. But Foley hopes that, after the election, Hurricane Sandy will spur a long-term discussion about climate change and extreme weather events. "This is an opportunity to have a conversation about how vulnerable we are to natural disasters," he said. "We need a good, balanced discussion, but with a sense of urgency." For New York's governor, that sense of urgency may have already arrived. "A fundamental rethinking of our built environment," and the long-term modifications that might be needed to protect New York City from coastal flooding, "is a massive, massive undertaking," Cuomo said yesterday. "But it is a conversation I think is overdue, and a conversation I think we should begin."

Hurricane Sandy in numbers:– 375,000 evacuated in lower Manhattan and other parts of New York City– 50,000 evacuated in Delaware– 30,000 evacuated in Atlantic City, New Jersey– 7,500 flights cancelled– 800 miles of coastland expected to be affected– 14 US Coast Guard crew members rescued off the coast of North Carolina– 2 more crew members remain missing. Hurricane Sandy is bearing down on the eastern seaboard’s largest cities, forcing thousands of people to leave their homes and shutting down mass public services. Over 7,000 flights were cancelled and airports were closed completely due to the storm, which is expected to last for days. The storm is threatening 50 million people on America’s heavily populated east coast, and forecasters warned that New York could bear the brunt of the “superstorm”, which is expected to come ashore on Monday evening. Public transport in the city was suspended on Sunday evening and thousands of school children stayed at home after schools were closed on Monday. Coastal residents have been fleeing their homes amid fears of a wall of water more than three metres tall, while the National Hurricane Center said that the storm has top sustained winds of 85mph, with higher gusts. Sandy is on track to collide with a wintry storm moving in from the west and cold air streaming down from the Arctic. The storm’s arrival has forced the president and Republican rival Mitt Romney to rearrange their campaign schedules in the crucial closing days of the presidential race before election day on 6 November. Early voting on Monday in Washington and Maryland was cancelled. The category one hurricane has already been blamed for 65 deaths in the Caribbean, and Americans are being urged to take warnings seriously amid fears that the “megastorm” could wreak havoc over 800 miles, from the east coast to the great lakes. Up to three feet of snow were even forecast in mountainous areas of West Virginia. States of emergency were declared in six US states, from North Carolina to Connecticut.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned people in low-lying areas of lower Manhattan and Queens to get out. “If you don’t evacuate, you are not only endangering your life, you are also endangering the lives of the first responders who are going in to rescue you,” he said. “This is a serious and dangerous storm.” New Jersey’s famously blunt Governor Chris Christie was less polite: “Don’t be stupid. Get out.” Public services suspended New York closed schools on Monday for the city’s 1.1 million students and announced it would suspend all train, bus and subway services on Sunday night because of the risk of flooding, shutting down a system on which more than five million daily commuters rely on. The New York Stock Exchange announced it will close its trading floor Monday. Officials also postponed Monday’s reopening of the Statue of Liberty, which had been closed for a year for a $30m renovation. President Barack Obama cancelled campaign events in the key battleground state of Florida to hurry back to Washington and oversee the federal response to Hurricane Sandy In Washington, he promised the government would “respond big and respond fast” after the storm hits. “My message to the governors as well as to the mayors is anything they need, we will be there, and we will cut through red tape. We are not going to get bogged down with a lot of rules,” he said. Both presidential candidates were forced to cancel campaign events in the run up to one of the closest presidential contests in recent US history. Parts of four competitive states were in the hurricane’s path: Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio and New Hampshire. Those states and five others – Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nevada and Colorado – that don’t reliably vote Democrat or Republican will decide the close election.
Hurricane Sandy Information Hurricane Sandy made history as the largest Atlantic hurricane on record when it made landfall near Brigantine, N.J., Oct. 29, 2012. With wind gusts in excess of 75 miles per hour and storm surge that inundated much of the New York and New Jersey coasts with water four to eight feet high, the aftermath proved even worse. Sandy killed at least 117 people in the United States, caused more than $50 billion in damage, and stranded millions of people for days in their homes without electricity, resulting from crippled public transportation systems and severe fuel shortages. Response In the days and weeks following the storm, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mobilized more than 800 personnel from worldwide locations to fulfill Federal Emergency Management Agency mission requests totaling $351 million to assist with the relief and recovery, primarily in New York and New Jersey. The Corps worked closely with its partners to dewater approximately 475 million gallons of salt water, install more than 200 generators to critical facilities such as hospitals and police stations, remove more than 300,000 cubic yards of debris in New York City alone, provide more than nine million liters of bottled water and begin repairs to projects. Recovery In a national commitment to help recover from the second-most costly hurricane in our Nation’s history, Congress in January 2013 passed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013. This act appropriated more than $5 billion to the Army Corps for the restoration and construction of federal projects in the impacted area. One year later, more than 200 projects and studies along the coastline from Florida to Maine and navigation channels inland to Ohio are planned and underway to restore projects to their design-level conditions and reduce the risks of future coastal storm damage. The majority of USACE's recovery program is undertaken in the North Atlantic Division with more than 150 projects and studies totaling more than $4 billion. The Great Lakes and Ohio River Division and South Atlantic Division also were allocated funding to restore coastal storm risk reduction projects and navigation channels in their regions. Resilience Increased resilience to future extreme weather is imperative, especially in the context of climate change, sea-level rise and other factors. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act further allocated $20 million for USACE to collaborate with federal, state, local and tribal partners in academia, government, non-governmental and private industry sectors to complete a comprehensive study to address the flood risks of vulnerable coastal population along 31,000 miles of coastline in the North Atlantic Division’s territory. The report will be delivered to Congress in January 2015. USACE contributed to the Sea Level Rise Tool for Sandy Recovery to create a set of map services to help communities, residents, and other stakeholders consider risks from future sea level rise in planning for reconstruction following Hurricane Sandy. The Corps also collaborated with NOAA to develop Infrastructure Systems Rebuilding Principles to promote a unified strategy for each agency’s approach to activities associated with rebuilding and restoration efforts in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Risk Reduction Risk reduction requires contributions from everyday citizens all the way to the federal government. It involves residents avoiding purchasing homes in flood-prone areas, raising homes that already exist, and insuring appropriately. State and local governments are responsible for appropriate zoning, cost sharing flood risk reduction projects and establishing, promoting and executing evacuation plans. With cooperation of federal partners like FEMA, EPA, DOI and others, USACE implements flood risk reduction measures such as dunes, beaches, barrier islands, levees, sea walls, groins and detached breakwaters to absorb and disburse wave energy. Despite every effort and abundant resources, there still is a degree of risk for the more than 50 percent of Americans who live in coastal regions. Collaborative efforts on all levels continue to explore and implement solution sets that reduce risk from coastal storms.
New York faces most intense storm in history City would actually benefit from a direct hit, forecast say EricHolthaus Jean Marie Brennan walks along the jetty at Lighthouse Point Park as Hurricane Sandy passes offshore in Ponce Inlet, Fla. on Friday. NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — As we’ve all heard by now, there is a big storm brewing on the East Coast. Looking at the latest weather models, that may be a bit of an understatement. The National Weather Service has labelled the hybrid gyre that may result from the merging of Hurricane Sandy and a Midwest snowstorm a “Frankenstorm.” When it hits, the storm could have truly scary implications befitting the Halloween holiday it will coincide with. In fact, computer models are now showing a storm so intense that it would break 100-plus year weather records for the most intense pressure readings ever recorded throughout nearly all of the Mid-Atlantic region northward into New York City and Long Island. Every hurricane that has ever hit that area — from last year’s Hurricane Irene, to the “Perfect Storm” of 1991, even the Long Island Express of 1938 — would all rank below this storm should current models of the atmosphere pan out. That’s a stunning conclusion, but one worth pondering, even though the storm’s peak impacts won’t be felt until Tuesday and there’s still time for models to shift. There’s reason to believe the models may be overdoing it. First off, what’s happening right now doesn’t have a clear precedence in the weather records. Our best available number-crunching simulations of the atmosphere simply weren’t designed for this scenario. Normally, when hurricanes approach the East Coast from Sandy’s angle, they are pulled safely out to sea by a semi-permanent low-pressure center near Iceland. This time around, that low pressure isn’t there. In fact, it’s been replaced by a high pressure so intense it only occurs approximately 0.2% of the time on average. The coincidence of that strong of a high pressure “block” being in place just when a hurricane is passing by — in and of itself a very rare occurrence — is just mind bogglingly rare. It’s the kind of stuff that’s important enough to rewrite meteorological textbooks. The result: Instead of heading out to sea Sandy’s full force will be turned back against the grain and directed squarely at the East Coast. To top it off, an intense early-season snowstorm moving eastward out of the Great Lakes will provide an additional boost of energy to Sandy as it approaches the shore, broadening its windfield, strengthening its rainfall and waves, and increasing its destructive potential. This is truly a Frankenstein scenario — a hybrid of weather badness that is now coming alive. The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center — the same folks at the National Weather Service that gave Sandy its “Frankenstorm” name — have had to manually adjust their official forecasts to tone down the exceptional scenarios that the weather models are currently showing. It’s not that they don’t think the worst-case scenario is possible. It’s just that it’s never happened before. As a meteorologist, you have to be very, very careful if you are going to predict a historic scenario. The storm is still a few days away, so there will be plenty of time to see how new model runs change with the addition of data from future Hurricane Hunter flights before the National Weather Service goes in full bore with an unprecedented forecast. For the time being, those from D.C. to Boston should remain especially vigilant and begin to take preparations to make sure they and their families are safe. Storm may hit New York the hardest Because the storm is expected to be so huge, the only reason its exact landfall location matters relates to the direction of the winds. Everyone from D.C. to New England will feel some type of effects, but because hurricanes rotate counter-clockwise, those north of the center will have massive amounts of seawater directly deposited on their shores. For those south of the center, the storm’s circulation will actually be pushing flooding seas away from shore, lessening potential impacts. Right now, the most reliable model tracks have clustered in a relatively tight range from Delaware to New York City. Counterintuitively, should the center of the storm make a direct strike on New York City, the city may actually be spared some of the more serious coastal impacts from the storm. Should the storm continue on its current path (the National Hurricane Center’s most likely landfall is now in southern New Jersey), all bets are off for the five boroughs. The latter scenario — the one that now appears most likely — would have many feet of ocean water funneled into New York Harbor over a period of up to 36 hours. Unlike Irene, which quickly transited New York City last year as a weakening tropical storm, Sandy may actually be in the process of strengthening when it makes landfall. The result could prove incredibly damaging for coastal residents and critical infrastructure. Keep in mind that Irene was only inches away from flooding subway tunnels in Lower Manhattan. Storm-surge forecasts for this scenario haven’t been officially released yet, but six to 10 feet in the city is not out of the question in a worst-case scenario. That result would put about 700,000 people’s homes underwater, according to a Climate Central interactive analysis. Add to that waves of 10 to 20 feet on ocean-facing shores, and an additional foot or so of tidal influence from the full moon, and we could be dealing with quite a mess on our hands. With National Geographic reporting that sea level rise is already accelerating at three to four times the global rate in the Northeast due to climate change, impacts are expected to be worse than if the same exact storm would have hit several years ago. Should Sandy veer further north of its current track and make landfall right over the city, storm surge could be dramatically lessened, though the city could receive about double the amount of rainfall — up to a foot or more. For these reasons, if I were a resident of New York right now, I’d be rooting for a direct hit. If given a choice, I’d take 12 inches of rain over six feet of coastal flooding any day.

This satellite image from NOAA shows Sandy on the morning of October 29, 2012 as it was about to begin its approach to the coast of New Jersey. Hurricane Sandy will be remembered as a raging freak of nature that became one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history. Here is a timeline from Sandy’s birth deep in the Caribbean Sea to its dissipation over Pennsylvania nine days later. October 22 A tropical depression forms in the southern Caribbean Sea off the coast of Nicaragua. The depression strengthens and becomes Tropical Storm Sandy, with maximum winds of about 40 mph. October 24 Sandy has become a Category 1 hurricane as it moves northward across the Caribbean and crosses Jamaica with winds of 80 mph. Although Sandy’s eye does not cross the Dominican Republic and Haiti to its east, the storm dumps more than 20 inches of rain on Hispaniola. More than 50 people die in flooding and mudslides in Haiti. October 26 Sandy strengthens as it moves from Jamaica to Cuba and strikes the historic city of Santiago de Cuba with winds of about 110 mph, only 1 mph below the status of a major Category 3 hurricane. “Everything is destroyed,” Santiago resident Alexis Manduley told Reuters by telephone. Sandy causes more devastation as it crosses the Bahamas and makes a slight turn to the north-northwest. October 27 Sandy moves away from the Bahamas and makes a turn to the northeast off the coast of Florida. News services estimate the death toll in the Caribbean at 70 or more. The storm briefly weakens to a tropical depression, but quickly re-intensifies into a Category 1 hurricane. October 28 Sandy continues moving northeast on a track that takes it parallel to the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. But the storm’s center stays well offshore as it approaches latitude 35 degrees north off the coast of North Carolina. Still, the storm sends powerful waves onto North Carolina’s Outer Banks, washing out NC Highway 12 in places. The storm is still a Category 1 hurricane with peak winds of about 80 mph. But an unusual configuration of weather factors is converging, and meteorologists warn that the storm likely wil morph into a powerful, hybrid super-storm as it churns northward. A high-pressure cold front to Sandy’s north will force the storm to start turning to the northwest toward major cities such as Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia and New York. And the full moon will make Sandy’s storm surge – expected to be 11 to 12 feet in some places – a little higher as it makes landfall. Sandy has expanded into a huge storm with winds covering about 1,000 miles. “You just don’t see this kind of stuff,” Keith Blackwell, a meteorologist at the University of South Alabama’s Coastal Weather Research Center in Mobile, tells National Geographic News. “It’s so strong and so large. Normally protected areas like New York Harbor and Long Island are seeing the worst-cast scenario.” October 2912:30 p.m.: Sandy has made its expected sharp turn toward the northwest on a path for the coast of New Jersey. The storm also has started interacting with other weather systems, gaining energy in the process. The storm will dump heavy snow in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina. Sandy will have a run of about 300 miles over open water as it heads for landfall, giving it time to build up a huge storm surge that will be a little bigger because of the influence of the full moon. Meanwhile, a replica of the tall ship HMS Bounty, en route from New London, Connecticut to Saint Petersburg, Florida with 16 people on board, is caught in Sandy’s raging seas in the infamous “Graveyard of the Atlantic” off the Outer Banks. CNN reports that the ship’s captain, Robin Walbridge, tries to steer his ship away from the worst of Sandy’s wrath, but the ship’s pumps fail and it begins rapidly flooding and starts to sink. Passengers and crew abandon the ship, but only 14 of the 16 people on board make it to the relative safety of the lifeboats. A rescue crew from the U.S. Coast Guard station at Elizabeth City, North Carolina pulls the survivors to safety aboard helicopters. They recover the body of one missing crewman, but Walbridge, the captain, is missing. During the afternoon: Sandy brings high winds and drenching rains from Washington, D.C. northward, toppling trees and power lines and cutting off electrical power for millions of people. The storm eventually will affect more than 50 million people on the Eastern Seaboard. 8 p.m.: Sandy’s center comes ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The storm is no longer considered a hurricane but is now classified as a post-tropical nor’easter. But the storm’s unusual path from the southeast makes its storm surge much worse for New Jersey and New York. A cyclone’s strongest winds and highest storm surge are to the front and right of its circulation because the power of the storm’s strongest winds is combined with its forward motion. New York Harbor receives this part of Sandy’s impact. The surge is worsened because the full moon has added about a foot to the surge and because Sandy arrives at high tide. Meteorologist Tim Morrin of the National Weather Service’s office in New York, tells National Geographic News that the surge — nearly 14 feet — is a new record for a storm surge in the harbor. The previous record of just over 10 feet was set in 1960 when Hurricane Donna passed just offshore. The surge tops the seawall at The Battery in Lower Manhattan and floods parts of the city’s subway system. The surge also floods the Hugh Carey Tunnel, which links Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. The storm’s huge size means that its winds, rains and flooding will pound New Jersey and New York throughout the night and through three cycles of high tides and low tides. Staten Island also is hit very hard by the storm. The Seattle Times later reports that towns such as Oakwood Beach, Midland Beach, South Beach and Tottenville — which lost many residents who were police and firefighters during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 — were among the hardest-hit communities. October 30 Although Sandy has started to move away from New York, the backside of the huge storm is still inflicting punishment on the Northeast. As the day progresses, Sandy weakens as it moves inland over Pennsylvania. October 31 The storm that began as Hurricane Sandy dissipates over western Pennsylvania, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issues its final advisory on the storm. NOAA’s advisory says “multiple centers of circulation in association with the remnants of Sandy can be found across the lower Great Lakes.” NOAA reports that Sandy killed more than 70 people in the Caribbean and at least 50 in the United States. NOAA estimates that Sandy caused at least $20 billion in damages. Update, November 3 NBC News reports that the death toll in the U.S. is now 109, including at least 40 in New York City. Half of New York’s deaths are on Staten Island. NBC also reports that damages from Hurricane Sandy likely will exceed $50 billion.

Comments Priscilla Jones Montauk, Ny October 9, 2017, 4:48 pm Sitting here at the ocean in amagansett NY… I can’t help but become overwhelmed with memories of Sandy’s wrath. My hometown of Montauk lost a very dear friend who was walking her dog during low tide as the eastern potion of Sandy lashed our coast line. She and her pup were swept away and carried two villages west to Georgia Beach in East Hampton, Ny. Her death devastated our small local community. She was a beautiful soul… gone in an instant. Please PLEASE never underestimate the power of Mother Nature… “Deet” was a native of Long Island and always respected the ocean and her powers… just as all of us born and raised here were tought to. Sandy was underestimated by most of us as we’ve had many near misses over the years and it’s easy to gain a false sense of security because of this. Again.:: PLEASE… never underestimate the power of the sea. You never want to go through the horror of walking down the beach and having to identify your mother as “Deer’s” two young daughters had to.:: compounding their grief was the death of their father just two years before.:: My prayers go out to all who were effected by Sandy… all the loss pain and suffering will never be forgotten here as I look to the sea. God Bless grace somewhere on mars October 3, 2017, 12:13 pm helped me so much with my geography paper!! thank you:)) Christopher Efthimiou Long Island, NY September 4, 2017, 10:27 am That storm was a catastrophic nightmare. No power from Halloween until Thanksgiving. Bad times. Christopher Efthimiou United States September 4, 2017, 10:18 am I live on Long Island, this storm caused angry mobs, and mild apocolypse because people started looting gas stations and grocery stores (and apparently Ace Hardware stores), plus burglars started to loot peoples houses (mine wasnt looted). We had no power until the week before Thanksgiving (which i was thankful to have back that year). And above all else, LIPA (Long Island Power Association) didn’t help as much as they could’ve. I swear, The Home Depot and Ace Hardware were out of generators and Midland NOAA Weather Radios. At the time, I was in high school, which ws cancelled for a solid 2 and a half weeks because the power was out. And should I even mention that on Long Island, there was also a blizzard a week after Superstorm Sandy was over? I cant even explain how thats even possible… My Halloween with my friends was ruined because of Sandy’s aftermath. But anyways, about the fate of LIPA, After the disappointment that LIPA brought to Long Island residents, they were shut down and replaced with PSE&G, which originates from the state of New Jersey. A ton of people were laid off. However, My fear, is that if another storm like this hits us on Long Island, we would have an extended power outage (longer than Superstrom Sandy’s chaos), because PSE&G would probably help New Jersey before us (I know it sounds ridiculous, but you never know) And in addition, Verizon Fios customers are left for dead, because we cant watch updates on The Weather Channel (because Verizon Fios completely replaced it with another [worthless] weather channel), At least I was/am safe after it, as well as my family, and can consider myself part of history in the making.

I was at Long Beach, New York (south shore on an outer island of Long Island facing the Atlantic Ocean). As of this writing, the streets (about 1 block from the ocean) still has about 3″ of sand on them, no electric, gas for heat, etc. Please do not forget these people and please continue to contribute to American Red Cross and the Long Beach Animal Shelter. The animal shelter was under about 4 feet of water and are in desperate need of food and supplies for all animals, especially dogs. Animals are being destroyed because they have no supplies. Please don’t forget these people and animals because the Media has stopped reporting about Hurricane Sandy. To Ruth in Jerusalem: Ontario County is well to the northwest of New York City and far enough inland that it would not have been affected by the storm surge.

Warriors for Elephants Nat Geo Expedition: Rising Star In November, 2013, an astonishing 1,500 fossil elements were excavated during the Rising Star Expedition in South Africa. In September, 2015 they were identified as belonging to a previously unknown early human relative that National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Lee Berger and team named Homo naledi. In May, 2017, the fossils were dated to 236,000-335,000 years ago, and new fossils from a second cave chamber were revealed. In October, 2017 the team returned to the caves once more, excavating three different locations that could each yield fascinating new information about Homo naledi. With at least 18 individuals of all ages and both sexes represented, these finds add an unprecedented amount of information to our understanding of early human evolution in Africa. In addition, the context of the fossil chambers strongly suggests that these non-human beings intentionally deposited their dead within this cave.
Hurricane Sandy: After Landfall Last night, Hurricane Sandy -- the largest Atlantic tropical system on record -- made landfall just south of Atlantic City, New Jersey, bringing winds up to 90 mph (150 kph), and pushing a massive storm surge onto beaches and shorelines. At least 12 deaths have been reported in the United States. These fatalities, when added to the previous toll in the Caribbean, leave Sandy responsible for more taking more than 80 lives to date. Millions across the Eastern Seaboard are now without power, and even more are struggling with rising floodwater. Sandy continues northward, now downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, and those affected are now assessing the damage. Collected here are images of Sandy's aftermath, many from New York City, which suffered widespread blackouts and a record-setting high tide early this morning.

Hurricane Sandy pulls out of the Bahamas Hurricane Sandy over the Northwestern Bahamas with 80mph winds, the cloud pattern shows a highly sheared storm – and one that is transitioning to something more of a hybrid between tropical and extra-tropical. GOES-14 high resolution 1-minute rapid scan satellite imagery. around 12pm October 26th 2012. Hurricane Sandy has been blasting through the Bahamas with some of the Central and Northwestern islands seeing a direct hit from Sandy and hurricane conditions as a result. Overnight, high southerly and south-southwesterly wind shear commenced over the center of Sandy. This has disrupted the core structure of the hurricane and injected dry air near the center – starting its transition into a more extra-tropical structure. Meanwhile, the cleanup begins in the Caribbean islands already affected and, unfortunately, reports of death and destruction have come in from Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In total, more than 20 people have reportedly died as a result of the storm. Forecast Track… Sandy made the turn to the Northwest yesterday that had it skirt the northern Bahamas delivering hurricane conditions there. This morning, its forward speed has slowed and it has turned back to the North. Tonight, Sandy should turn more to the northeast and pick up speed in response to an approaching trough currently over the Mississippi valley. By Monday, Sandy is expected to be at the latitude of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the trough has since stalled over the interior Northeast and a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along it. This wave of low pressure will turn Sandy back to the northwest, towards the Mid-Atlantic/New England coast for a potential landfall Wednesday morning. Sandy will not be fully tropical by this time, so it will have a broad wind field and the exact location of landfall becomes less important as effects spread over three hundred miles from that point. Official National Hurricane Center Hurricane Sandy track as of 11am Eastern time October 26th 2012. Forecast Impacts… The Bahamas…Hurricane conditions will subside in the northernmost islands of the Bahamas this afternoon, and tropical storm conditions should subside by Saturday afternoon. Storm surges of 3-5feet are occurring in areas of onshore winds while rainfall totals of 1-4″ are expected. Winds have likely reached near 80mph on eastern parts of Grand Bahama island and most of Little Abaco. Hurricane warnings are in effect for these islands and tropical storm warnings are in effect for the rest of the Northwest Bahamas. Florida…Tropical storm warnings are in effect along much of the East coast of Florida. Tropical storm conditions are occurring along the immediate coast in parts of Florida along with squally showers associated with Sandy. These winds are kicking up very high surf and are generating storm surges of about 1-3ft. Rainfall totals here should be around 2″. Tropical storm conditions should subside from south to north along the East Coast of Florida today and tomorrow as Sandy moves northwards and north-northeastwards. Bermuda… Tropical Storm conditions are possible on Sunday here as the wind field of this cyclone expands. A tropical storm watch is in effect as a result. Squally showers with (near) tropical storm conditions and large southwesterly swells are to be expected to start the work week here. The fact that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda and along the US East coast simultaneously suggests a storm more than 600miles in diameter. US East Coast… *Saturday morning – Monday morning: South Carolina and North Carolina (to Wilmington) will see offshore winds as Sandy passes well to the east this weekend. Tropical Storm conditions are possible mainly in the offshore marine areas here, but unlikely on land. Some showers may develop to produce some gusty winds however. Tropical storm watches are in effect along the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. There may be an area of onshore winds in the Outer Banks for a time that could produce some coastal flooding, and sound-side flooding will remain a threat for much of the storm’s passage. *Monday morning – Wednesday night: Outer Banks, NC northwards to Maine: Sandy is expected to make landfall in Southern New Jersey, near the mouth of Delaware Bay according to the National Hurricane Center’s most recent forecast. The entire New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts coasts could see: tropical storm conditions with hurricane force gusts possible, heavy rain that may lead to some inland flooding, and severe coastal flooding from a large storm tide. Meanwhile, areas inland and to the south may still see tropical storm force winds (or at least gusts to that strength), heavy potentially flooding rains, and even some snow farther inland; this could extend as far inland as Ontario and Quebec. Off shore winds, to the south of Sandy, may allow for hazardously low water levels, or coastal flooding from an unusual direction in Chesapeake Bay and the Outer Banks. Specifics of this forecast will be refined as the storm gets closer. Pay attention to emergency management messages and products/warnings from local and regional officials.
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Sunday, October 28, 2012 Hurricane Sandy: Finish Preparations! Storm Moving Faster It is time to wrap up preparations. Sandy still looks like a major threat and she is moving a little faster than originally anticipated. Don't make this mistake, "we underestimated this one." Hurricane Sandy at 8:30am CDT with 75 mph winds and a minimum pressure of 951 mb. University of Wisconsin Coastal winds are coming up a bit faster than I expected with gusts to nearly 40 mph at Norfolk, VA and gusts in the 30's in eastern North Carolina and DelMarVa. Kitty Hawk had a gust of 45 mph recently. Additional Rainfall Because some of the storm's rain has already fallen and because it is moving a little faster than originally forecast, the amounts don't look quite as impressive as earlier forecasts. However, these are more than sufficient to cause flooding in the areas with heavier rains. click to enlarge Winds The center of Sandy should move inside the shaded blue area. Now, I have to ask you to work with me to convey the wind threat. There is no way to, in a blog, list every single city of interest. So, pick out your location and I'll walk you through the highlights. This is, more or less, the storm's current wind field (actually, it is a forecast for 2pm EDT but bear with me): So, you can compare the changes from the current winds (above) to the forecasts (below). 8am EDT Monday forecast. Note, the exact position of the storm, and the corresponding winds, could shift north or south a little. The pressure is forecast to have fallen to 944 mb, stronger than now. U.S. GFS model via WeatherBell The winds surrounding the eye are forecast to have strengthened which is what is meteorologically expected with the falling pressure. Winds are already gusting above 40 mph from DelMarVa across NYC and along the southern New England coast. 2pm EDT Monday. Pressures have fallen another 4mb. Red winds = strong enough to cause power failures. Winds will be gusting above 50 mph from, roughly Washington, DC to NJ to Boston and southern New Hampshire. Very dangerous winds with gusts above 70 ph will be reaching Long Island (keep in mind the pattern may shift a little north or south). 8pm EDT Monday. Landfall in New Jersey Monday evening. Note that winds capable of causing power failures extend from Portland to Norfolk. Winds are coming up in the eastern Great Lakes. Dangerous winds are occurring in the D.C.-Baltimore area. Winds are relatively calm (temporarily!) near the eye. 2am EDT Tuesday The eye is in the general vicinity of Harrisburg. Strong winds are still occurring from D.C. up toward Hagerstown and over the eastern Great Lakes and southwest Ontario. There are other strong winds along the St. Laurence Valley. There will be a major storm surge. This map does not include the +2' astronomical tide (full moon) and wave action of 20' or more. So, preparations should be rushed to completion throughout this region. This storm is not weakening and will be as bad as I have feared.Snow/Blizzard The blue areas are under winter storm watches for high winds and heavy snow. Is It Hype? All weekend, even at the wedding reception last night, I've been asked if meteorologists are "hyping" this storm. Let me give you some metrics so you can compare what I am expecting so you can judge for yourself: $20 billion or more in damage Two million or more "customers" (individual homes and businesses) without power At least one land-based (as opposed to a ship over water) wind gust of 75 mph or higher So, there it is as best as I can lay it out. Hunker down in a sturdy building with some good books, board games, and look on it as one of life's adventures. Be prepared for an extended period of inconvenience. Try to have a good attitude -- you'll be able to bore your grandchildren with stories about the Great Storm of '12!
Northeast cleans up from Superstorm Sandy, death toll rises November 11, 2012|Jeanine Prezioso and Jonathan Allen | Reuters (Reuters) NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Yorkers took to the streets on Sunday to reinforce recovery from Superstorm Sandy, volunteering to help clean up devastated neighborhoods and using an annual Veterans Day parade to collect donations for victims still struggling without homes or electricity. Police raised the storm-related fatality toll in New York City to 43, adding the death of a 77-year-old retired custodian who was found paralyzed last week at the bottom of the steps of his apartment building in Rockaway, Queens, with head injuries. He died at a hospital on Saturday, they said. At least 121 people have perished in the storm, which caused an estimated $50 billion in property damage and economic losses and ranks as one of the most destructive natural disasters to hit the U.S. Northeast. The Rockaways peninsula of the city's Queens borough was especially hard hit when Sandy barreled into the East Coast on October 29, unleashing a record storm surge that flooded low-lying areas and fierce winds that toppled trees and power lines. Many residents said they felt exhausted. Priscilla Perez, 30, was climbing up 11 flights of stairs in the dark, carrying clothes, jugs of water supplies and her 1-year-old daughter to an apartment at the Bay Towers in Rockaway Park. Helping carry the load was her 10-year-old son, Elijah, who she said is struggling with the impact of the storm. "He doesn't want to eat. He's never been through anything like this," she said. "I tell him when we go to get food, 'Take a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, take a hot dog,' but he says no." Recovery workers, from volunteers to firefighters, National Park Service workers and thousands of National Guard members, helped clean up in Queens and the city's Staten Island borough, also badly damaged, clearing mounds of garbage, sand and debris. Medical teams went door to door to check on residents in high-rise buildings without power. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano paid a visit on Sunday to hundreds of federal recovery workers crammed into the mess hall aboard the T.S. Kennedy, a merchant marine training ship docked on Staten Island to serve as a floating hotel for government employees taking part in the effort. "Thank you, and thank you, and thank you," she told the workers, adding, "I hope you take some pride in what you're doing." Throughout the Eastern seaboard, thousands of homes were destroyed or badly damaged, millions were left without power, and commerce was brought to a virtual standstill in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The misery was compounded by an unseasonably early winter storm, or "Nor'easter" that lashed the region on Wednesday with more heavy winds, along with rain, sleet and snow. As many as 8.6 million utility customers lost electricity at some point in the midst of the back-to-back storms. On Sunday, nearly two weeks after Hurricane Sandy first struck, thousands were still in temporary shelters, while the tally of power outages had dwindled to about 167,000, according to the U.S. Energy Department. New York accounted for most of the remaining outages, the bulk of them on Long Island. In what was likely to be a great relief to hundreds of thousands of commuters struggling to get to jobs without mass transit, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced that some PATH trains that connect New York and New Jersey would resume service on Monday morning. However, service at the Hoboken, Exchange Place and World Trade Center stations was still suspended due to severe flooding and will likely remain so for several weeks, they said. Officials also announced the limited reopening of the Governor Hugh L. Carey Tunnel, formerly known as the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, for rush-hour bus service Monday morning. The tunnel, which connects Brooklyn with downtown Manhattan, flooded with an estimated 43 million gallons (162.8 million liters) of water that damaged electrical, lighting, communications, surveillance and ventilation systems, authorities said. In addition, Amtrak planned to reopen the so-called North Turbe rail tunnel under the Hudson for Amtrak passenger train and New Jersey Transit commuter service on Monday, according to a statement from U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. He said the tunnel, which was shut down immediately following Sandy, was expected to operate at 63 percent of normal capacity as further work continued. COLLECTING COATS FOR THE DISPLACED Organizers of the Veterans Day parade, New York City's first major post-Sandy event since its annual marathon race was canceled last weekend, asked spectators lining the parade route to bring winter coats to be donated to storm victims. The group New York Cares was hoping to collect 50,000 coats by week's end, part of an annual drive that began two weeks early to help Sandy victims.

Cuban President Raul Castro will travel Friday to Santiago de Cuba, the country's second largest city, to survey the damage. More than 3,000 buildings were damaged in eastern Cuba, state television reported. "I lost an upstairs room and part of my roof. There are trees down all over the place. Everyone is in shock. We have never had a storm hit like this," said a woman named Dulce, a doctor in the city of Santiago. Residents in Santiago spent Thursday assessing the extent of the damage. There was no electricity, and very few people had working phones, Dulce said. JUST WATCHED Hurricane Sandy 'storm of a lifetime' MUST WATCH JUST WATCHED Hurricane Sandy hits Jamaica MUST WATCH Hurricane Sandy hits Jamaica02:20 Heavy rain in Cuba brings with it potential health risks. Flooding over the summer in Granma province contaminated wells, leading to a cholera outbreak, the first Cuba had experienced in a century. The same province was hit hard by Sandy. In the Bahamas, as Olivia Jorjani and her mother were trying to watch the World Series game between power outages, tree branches in Nassau started to break and fall, and parking lots began to flood. It was just a matter of time before the lights went out again, and "then we will play gin by candlelight," the iReporter said from her home on New Providence Island. Bahamians and their guests hunkered down Thursday night as Sandy, a Category 2 hurricane, tore through the islands with 100 mph wind and the potential for up to 12 inches of rain. New Yorker John Trudden was staying at Club Med on San Salvador Island, celebrating a friend's birthday with 10 buddies. He said they will be confined to the hotel, which gave them food and drink to take to their rooms, until 8 a.m. Friday, when officials expect most of the storm to have passed over. Rolle, 29, waited for 40 minutes in line at a grocery store to purchase nonperishable goods and bread. He moved the potted plants and emptied part of his family's pool to make room for the rainwater. Sandy may not be a Category 5 monster, but "we take it seriously, and we just want to make sure we are comfortable," he said. As of 8 p.m. ET, the eye of the storm was 105 miles (170 kilometers) east of Nassau, sparing the Bahamas' largest city the worst part of the storm. "I don't think that it's going to do significant damage. Think there could be some debris, but in Nassau things are not as bad as they may be in the outer islands," CNN iReporter Cynthia Russell, an administration manager, said. Along the U.S. East Coast, residents were told to be wary headed into the weekend. CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said Sandy could have a bigger impact than Irene did last year, when it glanced off North Carolina before plowing into the Northeast. "This could be like the 'Perfect Storm' 21 years ago," he said of the potential damage. "It depends on where it hits." The "Perfect Storm" was the result of a nor'easter and Hurricane Grace combining into a one storm. In this case, a system approaching from the west is expected to interact with Sandy. To what extent is the question to be answered in the next four days. For now, Sandy is proving to be a windfall for surfers familiar with tamer tides. Even hundreds of miles away, the storm kicked up powerful surf off Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Jason Russo, a visitor from Connecticut, couldn't resist jumping in. "I went in the water, I did about three somersaults ... strong rip current," he told CNN affiliate WSVN. Fort Lauderdale's Ocean Rescue advised beachgoers to stay out of the water, but acknowledged not everyone would heed the warning. "The expert surfers will be out there, so we just tell them to be careful, and we're there if they need our help," Chief Breck Ballou said. "We're there to go out and get them." On Friday, more high waves and rip currents are likely along the coastal beaches of Florida's east coast and into southern Georgia, as well as tropical storm force wind gusts up to 50 mph. Saturday, tropical storm force wind gusts reaching 50 mph might be felt as far north as the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Rip currents and high waves will also be an issue along coastal Georgia and the Carolinas, with significant coastal flooding possible, especially during high tides. The five-day forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts the center of the storm will shadow the East Coast in the coming days, with Sandy potentially making landfall as a tropical storm in New Jersey the day before Halloween. Sandy also claimed two lives before reaching Cuba. A woman in western Haiti's Camp-Perrin died Wednesday when she tried to cross a flooding river in the Ravine du Sud, according to Haitian news agency AHP. And CNN affiliate TVJ reported a man in Jamaica was killed when he was hit by a boulder sent tumbling downhill by the storm's rain. In the Dominican Republic, Misael Rincon, a CNN iReporter, couldn't sleep as Sandy's rain beat down on Santo Domingo because he knew his neighborhood is prone to flooding. He drove to work on Thursday but had to change his route several times, as he encountered roads with water levels too high. Even though he drives an SUV, a blue Ford Explorer, he was not high enough off the ground to avoid having water seep into his vehicle. "I'd say 70% of the streets in Santo Domingo are flooded," he said. Some cars were submerged, and people with trucks were charging motorists $5 to pull their vehicles to higher ground, he said. There were some good Samaritans, too. The government ordered evacuations of high-risk zones and canceled schools.

Saturday, October 27, 2012 Hurricane Warnings Will NOT Be Issued for the Northeast I apologize for the confusion but here is the final word from Dennis Feltgen, head of public relations for the National Hurricane Center. Mike, We will put something on our website and FB page soon to explain this. But the bottom line is that a hurricane watch/warning for the coast cannot be issued if it is not a hurricane. It has to be handled by the other NWS watch/warnings products -Dennis Thanks, Dennis! That said, I strongly disagree with this decision for the reasons stated earlier. For the purposes of this blog, I will continue to refer to the swirl of clouds that is Hurricane Sandy as Hurricane Sandy. Addition: Here is the problem in a nutshell. This was just (2:17pm CDT) cut and pasted from the NWS. Note the (brown) high wind watch inland. But, there is no high wind watch or warning for Long Island or NYC!!! There is little QC or consistency between local NWS offices.
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Friday, October 26, 2012 8AM Friday: Hurricane Sandy Update A very prominent and respected National Weather Service meteorologist wrote on Facebook last night, I've never seen anything like this and I'm at a loss for expletives to describe what this storm could do. Yes, I've never seen anything like it either nor have our modern meteorological tools. As I wrote yesterday afternoon, we don't know whether our tools are up to the task because no storm of this nature has occurred in the modern meteorological era. With that bit of explanation, here is my forecast and advice. It is near certain Hurricane Sandy will make landfall rather than turning out to sea. There is some clustering in the models between Long Island and DelMarVa. In this case the specific center of the storm is much less important than in most hurricanes because the high winds will be spread out away from the center. There will be flooding rains. While the exact path of the heaviest rains may shift some to the north or south, large areas of six inch and greater rainfalls will cause flooding. If you live in a flood plain, you need to be prepared to evacuate. Power will fail in a large geographic area. There is a fair amount of inconsistent information this morning pertaining to peak gusts, i.e., will they be 60 mph or 80 mph? But, since power often fails with a 60 mph gust, it may not matter. Because of the geographic extent (winds capable of causing power failures in a swath hundreds of miles in width), there could be massive power failures and, once out, the power may be out for weeks. Snow will likely fall and it may be heavy. Why does it matter that it is snowing over the central High Plains? Because that is the cold air that will reach the western part of Sandy's circulation causing the rain to change to snow in the Appalachians. The snow will be heavy in places and may contribute to additional power failures. The storm surge will be destructive. Because wind speed and direction are so important, I can't offer a map of predicted storm surges yet. But, there will be areas where the combination of full moon, waves of more than 20 feet, and storm surge cause great destruction in coastal areas. So, how should you prepare? Here are my suggestions. Get prescriptions refilled now, especially if your doctor must approve the refill. Vote. If the stronger models are correct, power could still be out in some paces on election day. Regardless, that is one less thing you will need to do. The election will not (and shouldn't be) postponed. If you can get an electrician to install a generator, get it done. Do not try to install a generator yourself. If you don't have a generator, get a power inverter or two. Radio Shack and similar stores sell them. They are a "poor man's generator" and will keep your cell phone, laptop, and similar charged. Keep your car's gas tank full. If you have a wood-burning fireplace and you know your chimney is clear, get wood. Keep some indoors to keep it dry during the storm. You may need it to heat your home. If you live in a 100-year flood plain (you can check at city hall or your library) or on the coast figure out your evacuation strategy now. Make your list of things you will take with you. Fill a few gas cans (the type you would use for your mower) to have extra in the event of power failures. Purchase extra staples. Without power, stores will be closed. Purchase booster batteries for your cell phone and other essential equipment. If you need insulin or other medicine that must be kept chilled make plans now. Consider what you would do if you were without electricity for a month. If you have an invalid living with you that requires electricity, there will be areas that will be without for weeks. Be proactive. If you live in a heavily wooded area, does someone in your vicinity have a gasoline-powered chain saw? Does it have fuel and a reasonably good chain/blade? Test it, now. Get to an ATM. Without power, credit card readers and ATMs will not be working. In a disaster, cash is king. And, if you are planning to travel by air to or through airports between Richmond-Boston Monday through Wednesday, forget it. Here is what you should do, now. Amtrak in the Northeast Corridor will likely have service interruptions. We are in uncharted territory here. I believe this will be a major storm that will dominate the news for days. Prepare accordingly. 4 comments: Thanks. I added some things when I shared on Facebook: . Might I add charge your cell phones, make sure you have a cell phone car charger, plenty of candles/matches, puzzle books & pencils, games and things to keep you busy while the electricity is out. Also, buy plenty of charcoal and/or propane. Here's the latest Noaa predication for Sandy.http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdepd.

Yes...car charger. Also understand that when your cell phone is on and the cell towers are out your cell phone will use more battery power to search for a connection...so you may want to turn it off...Good luck.
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Saturday, October 27, 2012 How Much Damage from Hurricane Sandy? Roger Pielke, Jr. has an insightful blog post pertaining to the potential damage for Hurricane Sandy. With the caveat that we are in meteorologically uncharted waters (i.e., we've never had a storm of this nature in the modern meteorological era), I'd like to offer some speculation that might be useful: Sandy may cause more than $100 billion in damage, more than Katrina. You can refresh your memory about Katrina's damage here. The computer models that I trust are getting more and more in synch on a record storm. Last night's European model with a 944 mb center just before landfall. This morning's U.S. GFS with a 936 mb (!) center just before landfall. While the details are important to a given location, the overall message is nearly identical: This will be a tremendous storm. If either of these model forecasts are exactly correct (that is still a big "if"), I expect the total damage (including loss to the U.S. economy) to be worse than Katrina.

Read More Hurricane Sandy Walloping East Coast With Surge, Winds Published: October 29th, 2012 Hurricane Sandy is wreaking havoc on the East Coast, shutting down airports, downing trees and power lines, and producing what may be a devastating storm surge toward the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts, including New York City. Here are some of the latest details on the storm with our Storify. Hurricane Sandy Driving Massive Storm Surge Toward the Mid-Atlantic Hurricane Sandy is about to make landfall in southern New Jersey or Delaware, according to the National Hurricane Center. Dire warnings have been issued for much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast for life-threatening coastal flooding. Storified by · Mon, Oct 29 2012 13:29:30 Hurricane Sandy is headed for a landfall in southern New Jersey early on Monday evening, driving a record storm surge into New York City, Long Island Sound, and Raritan Bay. During a media briefing on Monday afternoon, National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb said the storm is on track to produce a storm tide (includes storm surge and the astronomical tide) of up to 11 feet in New York City. This could be enough to flood the subway tunnels in Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, which would severely disrupt transportation in the region.

Hurricane Sandy has turned into a massive storm, with the core of a hurricane and the shell of a nor'easter, as this visible satellite image from the University of Wisconsin shows. The minimum central pressure at the center of the storm set a record for the lowest pressure reading observed north of Cape Hatteras, N.C. (This is a sign of how powerful the storm is, since the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm.) RT @afreedma: Wow. #Hurricane #Sandy has a min central pressure of 940 mb. To put in perspective, all-time record in this region was 946 mb set in 1938.Brian P. Hickey Fbcdn The National Weather Service Forecast Office in Anchorage prepared this graphic to illustrate how an area of cold air plunging southward into the U.S. helped energize Sandy as it neared the coastline. That cold air is having major impacts in places like West Virginia, where up to 3 feet of snow is expected. According to Louis Uccellini, the director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in College Park, Md., there has never been a hurricane of this magnitude that also produced such heavy snowfall on the East Coast.
How Hurricane Sandy Displaced Everyone It Touched In the history of the United States, we've moved people for all sorts of reasons, blithely certain that they'll be fine. The sterile terms we've given these processes—"managed retreat" or "urban renewal"—suggest that they're, well, manageable. But it's not as easy as the planners would have us believe. Over decades, I have studied the significant social, emotional, and psychological costs of displacement. As a psychiatrist, I have seen the painful and often unseen effects of urban renewal, gentrification, and other major changes in cities. Displacement triggers lifelong sorrow, what psychologist Marc Fried famously called "grieving for a long home." And it's not just grief over a place. Displacement breaks up social networks, and disperses social capital. It costs individuals an enormous amount of money, very little of which is replaced by any of the "repayment" schemes, which typically cover the cost of a house, but not the intangibles like replacing one's neighborhood. And it sets people back, adding opportunity costs to other kinds of problems. I've called this "root shock," to try to capture the ways in which upheaval disturbs our very connection with the earth. Experts tend to use displacement to mean moving people away from a particular geography. But recent storms in New Jersey, where I live, have caused me to reconsider this definition. In August 2011, Tropical Storm Irene was supposed to bear in on the coast of New Jersey, so my family and I decided to wait out the storm in the New York town of Warwick. As fate would have it, the storm hit there directly, flooding the downtown and nearby roads. On arriving home, I found two feet of water in my basement. Then, in October 2011, a freak snowstorm swept through the region before leaves had fallen from the trees, breaking limbs, downing electric lines and flooding my basement. Halloween was canceled. Just one year later, in October 2012, Hurricane Sandy destroyed our train service into New York City, where I work. It was months before the route was fully restored. To cap it all off, a nor'easter ripped through the region the following February, causing yet more damage. While many people living in the Sandy-affected region have been physically displaced by the storm, all of us—even those who continue to live in the same location—have to reconcile the fact that we now live in a new weather system. While the weather displaced some of us from our homes, it cost us all a way of life. This is a different, but very profound, kind of displacement. It is with this mindset I look at the reality we now inhabit. Sandy led FEMA to change its flood maps, which means countless homeowners now face a steep rise in insurance costs. That will lead some people to move, undermining communities and the very nature of the shore, which, in many ways, holds New Jersey together. While the weather displaced some of us from our homes, it cost us all a way of life. Understanding displacement isn't just a matter of determining who lives in the FEMA flood zone and who lives safely outside it. Homeowners like me, five miles from the water's edge, depend entirely on trains, gas deliveries and electricity, and all of this regional infrastructure is situated at the water's edge. Flooding in my basement threatens all the equipment that makes my house function – my furnace, hot water heater, washer and dryer. I have put in a sump pump, but now I need a generator to run it if the electricity fails. I am saving up for the generator, and hoping I get the money before we get a storm. That is only the beginning of the costs I face in refitting my house for the new weather. As an adviser to Rebuild by Design, I have helped teams develop their plans for Hurricane Sandy recovery. As the designers tackle the implications of their research, it is important to remember that climate change has deeply personal effects. I've asked designers to consider the Jersey Shore, for example, as the center of New Jersey, a place that is held together by homeowners now facing high insurance. By living on the shore, those homeowners help maintain one of the state's greatest assets — might we plan differently if we understood that they are the backbone of New Jersey's tourism industry? We want to come through this crisis a stronger region. But to do that we must take good care of everyone who is displaced. In this situation, that is everyone.

New York, New Jersey Still Unprepared For Storm Like Hurricane Sandy, Report Says NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – Five years after being slammed by Hurricane Sandy, a new report says New York and New Jersey will not be better prepared if a storm of that size hits again. Holly Leicht served as the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s regional administrator during Superstorm Sandy. On Wednesday, she likened the government’s response to building an airplane while it’s already in flight, WCBS 880’s Marla Diamond reported. “Let’s make these improvements so that we don’t find ourselves in the midst of that again,” she said. Among Leicht’s 41 recommendations were developing a single disaster relief website for impacted homeowners, and giving Congress the authority to issue block grants for a set amount immediately following the declaration of an emergency. Staten Island Borough President James Otto said he hopes the report leads to positive change in disaster response. “When my constituents tell me that the Sandy recovery was worse than the storm itself, it tells me that we as a government have to do a better job next time out,” he said.

Read More New Storm Threatens Areas Hit Hard By Hurricane Sandy By Andrew Freedman Published: November 5th, 2012 , Last Updated: November 5th, 2012 Storm-weary residents of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are facing the prospect of another significant coastal storm this week, although it will not be as severe as Hurricane Sandy. However, given the vulnerable state of New Jersey’s beaches, many of which lost most of their protective sand dunes during last week’s super storm, the next nor’easter may cause some damage and beach erosion. A computer model projection from the Canadian model, showing an intense storm off the Mid-Atlantic coastline on Thursday.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: Weatherbell Models. While computer models still disagree on the exact track and strength of the storm, which is set to affect the region on Wednesday and Thursday, lingering into Friday in Southern New England, it is likely that the areas hardest-hit by Sandy could see heavy rain, strong winds of up to 60 mph in places, and minor to moderate coastal flooding due to strong northeasterly winds. Computer models are in agreement that the storm will form and intensify as it moves up the East Coast from Florida, although some show more strengthening than others. The storm track and intensity will be key for determining the impacts of the event, as everything from strong winds to inland snow is possible with this event. The coastal flooding is not expected to come close to the record storm surge seen during Sandy, when much of Lower Manhattan flooded, and at least 19 people were killed on Staten Island. Unlike Hurricane Sandy, the nor’easter will be hitting when astronomical tides are at a low level, although a storm surge of 3 to 5 feet above regular tide levels is possible, particularly in western Long Island Sound, the National Weather Service (NWS) stated. The threat of coastal flooding is mainly limited to the Wednesday afternoon to Wednesday night high tides. The nor’easter may be slow to leave the Northeast, due to the continued influence of a “blocking” high pressure area in northeastern Canada and southwestern Greenland. A similar weather pattern helped steer Hurricane Sandy on an unprecedented track into the Mid-Atlantic states, and some studies have shown that Arctic sea ice loss increases the frequency and severity of such blocking patterns. Forecast surface weather map on Thursday morning, showing a strong storm east of New York City. Credit: NOAA/HPC. Even before the nor’easter, though, there is another weather threat that could hinder storm recovery efforts, and threaten those who are still without power. Preceding the storm will be colder than usual weather for this time of year, with most areas outside of New York City dipping below freezing on Monday night. Such overnight lows are more typical for early December than early November. The forecast low temperature by Tuesday morning in Central Park is 35 degrees, while suburban areas, including parts of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, could dip into the mid-to-upper 20s. “Those without power should take extra precaution due to the cold tonight. Do everything you can to prepare for these freezing temperatures," the NWS stated.
Is New York City Ready for Another Sandy? There was a time, not so long ago, when hurricane season had little to do with New York City. Then Hurricane Irene hit in 2011, as did Hurricane Sandy in 2012, with devastating consequences. It’s impossible to know if New York will find itself staring down another major storm this summer, but NOAA has already predicted that hurricane season — which officiallly began Saturday — will be unusually strong this year. “The outlook calls for a 70% chance of an above-normal season, a 25% chance of a near-normal season, and only a 5% chance of a below-normal season,” a recent NOAA reportwarned. And here’s the answer: It depends, obviously, on what aspect of storm preparedness you focus on. But in general? No. Notreally. The Subway Sandy flooded the subways like never before, grinding the city to a halt for days and causing long-lasting damage in some cases. The South Ferry 1 station returned to service just two months ago (via an old tunnel), and a stretch of A line in the Rockaways came back online last week. But if another Sandy-type storm hits the city this summer, the subways might not fare much better than last year, because advanced solutions to subway flooding — like putting up temporary walls around subway stairwells, or plugging entrances with inflatable bladders, for example — are still months or yearsaway. The South Ferry station on November 3, 2012. “If a hurricane were to approach the city in the immediate term, the agency’s best option for fortifying stations would most likely be the same: sandbags, plywood, and the hope that water would not find a way through,” the Times reported in May. In an effort to limit the amount of water that would “find its way through,” the MTA plans to be extra diligent about sealing as many as possible of the 540 subway openings in lower Manhattan that have been identified as potential weakpoints. “I can’t say for a fact we covered all 540 [before Sandy],” Thomas F. Prendergast, the MTA’s interim executive director, said recently. “So, what we want to do is make sure we have an exhaustive list of all our entry points and we have a specific solution for each one ofthem.” Nevertheless, could the subways get flooded again if the city is hit with another Sandy? “Absolutely,” Prendergastadmitted. The Power Grid The subway system wasn’t the only piece of city infrastructure that suffered under Sandy. As a certain famous photograph documented, hundreds of thousands of Con Ed customers were left without power when the power grid crapped out, leaving some residents in the cold and dark for days or weeks afterward. Such widespread outages seem somewhat less likely this summer thanks to $400 million in improvements Con Ed has made since October. These include constructing more than a mile of concrete walls around power substations and raising transformers and other equipment off the ground. Con Ed hopes to spend another $1 billion over the next four years on further protective measures (and is asking the state for the right pass the entire cost on to theircustomers.) Five hospitals were evacuated during Sandy, and though there were no fatalities, the process was risky, difficult, and not something that anyone wants to repeat. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and the co-chair of Governor Cuomo’s post-Sandy disaster readiness commission, says the evacuations stemmed from “coordination and organizational issues as well as physical, structural, and infrastructural issues which were extremelyproblematic.” A patient is evacuated in the dark from NYU Langone Medical Center on October 29, 2012, the night Sandy hit. Photo: Michael Heiman/2012 Getty Images However, the costs of ameliorating these issues are high — and federal cutbacks to hospital preparedness funds have made the effort more difficult at the worst time. “We’re on a collision course with fate here,” Redlener says, “because we’re just creating a situation where disaster resiliency is not where it should be and the resources to improve this resiliency are simply notavailable.” Since Sandy, “There’s no evidence that significant improvements have been made yet,” Redlener tells us, though not due to a lack of effort. “There’s a lot of meetings happening, so I don’t think the hospitals are ignoring it. I just think that we’re dealing with a short time frame and very littlemoney.” The Fuel Situation New Yorkers were having flashbacks to the seventies (not the coolparts) as fuel shortages and long lines at the gas station plagued the greater metropolitan area for weeks after Sandy hit. Unfortunately, there’s no easyfix. “The ability to get gasoline to fuel pumps in a crisis is not only dependent on protocols that emanate from government,” Redlener says. “And the government’s authority over the private sector element of the fuel supply chain is limited. The best they can do is create incentives to help elements of the supply chain function better nexttime.” A woman on a gas line yelling at someone else on the gas line to "fuggetaboutit," probably. Photo: Spencer Platt/2012 Getty Images As for the rest of the fuel supply chain, it remains very vulnerable. “We would, in essence, be in the same situation minus some additional gasoline stations still having power thanks to backup generators,” a spokesman for AAAtold Reuters inApril. The Shoreline The Rockaways, one of the areas hardest hit by Sandy, may have its bathrooms and concession stands in time for beach season, but, so far, there isn’t much stopping the next Sandy from destroying the area all over again. Certain stretches of sand along the southern coast will be, or have already been, fortified with HESCO barriers and TrapBags, the Daily News reports. And the sand that was lost to Sandy will be trucked in by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers beginning this month, but the entire process — involving 3.5 million cubic yards of sand — won’t be complete until sometime in 2014. All of these solutions, however, are piecemeal andtemporary. “We are going to be at the mercy of the next couple of storms,” says John Cori, a local activist and member of Friends ofRockaway. “The only reason why some residents would be less impacted is that so much housing infrastructure has yet to be rebuilt,” Michael Sinensky, Friends of Rockaway’s executive director, tells Daily Intelligencer. “So they have less to lose this nextseason.” Staten Island’s coast will be beefed up with a “reinforced dune system,” but it won’t be in place until around the middle of hurricane season. And one of the hardest-hit areas of the city — Midland Beach, where Sandy killed eight people — was left out of the project because it wasn’t deemed vulnerable enough according to Army Corps of Engineersguidelines. If the city can’t save the homes lining its shoreline, it can at least order the people living in those homes to get to safe ground before the storm hits. This month, the Bloomberg administration will announce an updated, six-tier evacuation plan (up from three tiers) which will place an additional 640,000 or so residents in an evacuation zone. (Of course, evacuation orders are only effective if people listen, and they often don’t.). A tentative map of the new borders was released inMay: All in the all, the city’s best hope is that hurricane season simply passes it by thisyear. “I think there’s probably intention on the city’s part to improve the level of preparedness for major storms,” Redlener says. “I just don’t think that there’s any evidence so far that we’ve made greatprogress.”

Also note that pressure bottomed out just above 960mb. A site at Sandy Hook, NJ stopped reporting before the peak storm surge/tide. Heavy rain combined with the storm tide on the Chesapeake and Delaware bays caused flooding in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The storm tide travelled up the Hudson river leading to record levels at Poughkeepsie. Rivers are still rising in response to the heavy rains from the storm still flowing into them. Heavy snow and (near) blizzard conditions are occurring the central Appalachian mountains and Ohio. Storm conditions are still occurring on the Great Lakes leading to very rough lake conditions and coastal flooding where onshore winds are producing 1-3ft water level rises. Damages from this hurricane will likely be astronomical in expense, mainly from the coastal flooding and power outages. In these coastal areas, many trees still had their leaves and so tree damage, power outages, and damage to homes from falling trees was the primary form of wind damage. Tree damage, power line damage, and roof damage from the weight of the snow, which was of a high water content, were the most common form of damage where feet of snow have fallen in the mountains. Meteorologically, this storm was significant because of its rare form of interaction with an extra-tropical system, its trajectory, its record breaking low landfall pressure of 946mb, and its size. A storm like this has immense potential to cause death and destruction and that it has indeed lived up to its potential. The name Sandy will likely be retired.

Read More Scientists Develop New Way of Classifying Hurricanes By Andrew Freedman Published: May 7th, 2013 , Last Updated: May 8th, 2013 For the past 40 years, the Saffir-Simpson Scale has been used to neatly classify all hurricanes into five categories. The scale, created by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson in the early 70s, is simple. It measures a storm’s maximum sustained wind speed — no more, no less. Its limitations – the biggest being that it does not account for the size of a storm’s wind field and its capacity to cause coastal inundation at landfall – have spurred scientists to develop a more comprehensive index. Hurricane Sandy had a massive tropical storm force wind field that at one point spanned the entire East Coast from North Carolina to Massachusetts. Credit: National Hurricane Center. Saffir-Simpson’s limitations were brought to the forefront last October by Hurricane Sandy, which briefly reached a maximum intensity of Category 3, and weakened to a Category 1 storm closer to landfall. That minimal hurricane classification may have led some to downplay its destructive potential, a perception that proved dead wrong when the storm made landfall — technically as a post-tropical cyclone at that point — pushing a record-high storm surge onto the Jersey Shore and into New York Harbor, and flooding low-lying areas. Had people known ahead of time that Sandy’s size and energy were far more powerful than even 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, they might have prepared for the storm differently. Now, a new study, published in the journal Monthly Weather Review by scientists from Florida State University, proposes a new metric that aims to complement Saffir-Simpson and other recently developed scales by taking into account a storm’s intensity, duration, and size. The metric, known as “Track Integrated Kinetic Energy,” or TIKE, builds from an existing measure of storm integrated kinetic energy (IKE), which was developed in 2007. This would help augment the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, for example, and the Power Dissipation Index (PDI), both of which seek to describe the amount of energy expended by a tropical storm or hurricane. The biggest benefit of the new TIKE index is that it could raise the alarm for storm surge risk at a time when sea levels are rising and coastal population is soaring. It may also help scientists detect trends in storm size, which may be related to warming sea and air temperatures. The IKE metric incorporates the ability of a hurricane’s winds to set ocean water into motion, via waves and storm surge, while also measuring how the storm’s winds would affect structures in its path. The TIKE metric expands the IKE concept by adding IKE measurements over the lifespan of a tropical cyclone, as well as over all named tropical cyclones in the hurricane season. The new study looked at the seasonal and year-to-year variations in Atlantic Ocean tropical cyclone activity during the period from 1990-2011, a period of reliable storm observations, and found that the storms with the highest TIKE values tend to form in the eastern tropical Atlantic. September, which tends to be the busiest month for tropical storms and hurricanes, is also the peak month on the TIKE index, the study found, with the greatest frequency of large storms. Coastal homes in Texas' Bolivar Peninsula were wiped out by the storm surge from Hurricane Ike in 2008. Credit: NOAA. However, during the month of October — which is when Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. — there tends to be an uptick in the number of particularly large, long-duration storms closer to the western Atlantic, the study found. Vasu Misra, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of meteorology in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science at FSU, said recent storms, such as Hurricane Ike in 2008 and Hurricane Sandy, have shown that damages from coastal flooding far exceed the wind damage caused by these storms, and that the size of a storm’s wind field helps determine the height of the storm surge. “Existing metrics overemphasize the intensity part which is based solely on wind speeds,” Misra said in an interview. Both Ike and Sandy were exceptionally large hurricanes. In fact, Sandy set a record for having the largest wind field of any hurricane on record, with a diameter of about 900 miles at one point. “The swath of [Hurricane Sandy’s] very strong winds along the coastline was huge, and it produced a huge amount of inundation along the coast,” Misra said. According to Misra, Hurricane Sandy had a higher TIKE value than any other tropical storm or hurricane in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin since 1990. Hurricane Lily, which occurred in 1996, was the runner-up, followed by 2010’s Igor, 1995’s Luis, 1997’s Erica, and Hurricane Olga, which occurred in 2001. Consistent with other research, the study found that La Niña events, which feature cooler-than-average water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, tend to be associated with hurricane seasons with large TIKE values, as do warmer-than-average conditions in the central and northern Atlantic Ocean. Misra and his colleagues hope to develop the capability of predicting TIKE values for an entire season, which could be useful for coastal residents and officials, and a welcome addition considering the lessons from Hurricane Sandy. Editor's Note: This story has been revised to indicate that Hurricane Sandy briefly reached Category 3 intensity, not Category 2 intensity as originally indicated. This is according to a post-event analysis conducted by NOAA.

Read More How Global Warming Made Hurricane Sandy Worse By Andrew Freedman Published: November 1st, 2012 , Last Updated: October 31st, 2012 As officials begin the arduous task of pumping corrosive seawater out of New York City’s subway system and try to restore power to lower Manhattan, and residents of the New Jersey Shore begin to take stock of the destruction, experts and political leaders are asking what Hurricane Sandy had to do with climate change. After all, the storm struck a region that has been hit hard by several rare extreme weather events in recent years, from Hurricane Irene to “Snowtober.” Photo of coastal flooding in Mantoloking, New Jersey, taken from a New Jersey Air National Guard Helicopter. Credit: NJNG/Scott Anema. Scientists cannot yet answer the specific question of whether climate change made Hurricane Sandy more likely to occur, since such studies, known as detection and attribution research, take many months to complete. What is already clear, however, is that climate change very likely made Sandy’s impacts worse than they otherwise would have been. There are three different ways climate change might have influenced Sandy: through the effects of sea level rise; through abnormally warm sea surface temperatures; and possibly through an unusual weather pattern that some scientists think bore the fingerprint of rapidly disappearing Arctic sea ice. If this were a criminal case, detectives would be treating global warming as a likely accomplice in the crime. Warmer, Higher Seas Water temperatures off the East Coast were unusually warm this summer — so much so that New England fisheries officials observed significant shifts northward in cold water fish such as cod. Sea surface temperatures off the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic remained warm into the fall, offering an ideal energy source for Hurricane Sandy as it moved northward from the Caribbean. Typically, hurricanes cannot survive so far north during late October, since they require waters in the mid-to-upper 80s Fahrenheit to thrive. Scientists said about 1°F out of the 5°F East Coast water temperature anomaly may have been due to manmade global warming. Warmer seas provide more water vapor for storms to tap into; that water vapor can later be wrung out as heavy rainfall, resulting in flooding. The most damaging aspect of the storm was the massive storm surge that struck the coastline from Massachusetts to Maryland. Global warming-related sea level rise gave the surge a higher launching pad than it would have had a century ago, making it more damaging than it otherwise would have been. This is only going to get worse as sea level rise continues as a result of warming ocean waters and melting polar ice caps and glaciers. The storm surge at The Battery in Lower Manhattan was the highest ever recorded at that location. It surpassed even the most pessimistic forecasts, with the maximum water level reaching 13.88 feet above the average of the daily lowest low tide of the month, known as Mean Lower Low Water, including a storm surge component of 9.23 feet. That broke the official record of 10.5 feet above Mean Lower Low Water set in 1960 during Hurricane Donna, as well as a record set during a hurricane in 1821. A water vapor satellite image of Superstorm Sandy on Tuesday, Oct. 30.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: Stu Ostro/Facebook. Or, to put it in simpler terms, the water level reached 9.15 feet above the average high-tide line. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate researcher at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, said manmade climate change likely contributed to the storm surge at The Battery in Lower Manhattan, with 15 inches of long-term sea level rise recorded at that location, the result of manmade sea level rise, sinking land, and ocean currents. She said the manmade contribution to the storm surge may have been a small amount. But to the Metropolitan Transit Authority or Con Ed, the main electric utility in Manhattan, each inch of sea level rise matters a great deal. If a similar storm were to strike New York in 2050, it would cause even more damage, since sea levels are expected to be considerably higher by midcentury. In fact, a recent study found that sea level rise has taken place at an accelerated rate at locations north of Norfolk, Va., and if this pace continues the Northeast could see much higher sea levels than other parts of the East Coast by midcentury. By warming the seas and the atmosphere, global warming is also expected to alter hurricane frequency and strength, making North Atlantic hurricanes slightly more powerful, while reducing the overall number of storms during coming decades. Detecting such changes in the observational record is difficult, considering the varying ways people have kept tabs on hurricanes prior to the era of hurricane hunter aircraft flights and satellite imagery. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that warmer sea surface temperatures are tied to an increase in stronger Atlantic hurricanes. “Blocked” Weather Pattern In addition, an unusual weather pattern in the northern hemisphere steered the storm in an unprecedented direction, as it made a dramatic — and for many East Coast residents, catastrophic — left hook right into coastal New Jersey. The east-to-west movement, which is exactly the opposite of how weather systems normally move in this area, helped maximize the storm surge, since a strong easterly air flow struck the coast at a right angle. Satellite loop from the University of Wisconsin, showing Hurricane Sandy as it made landfall in New Jersey. The upper-air flow over the Atlantic Ocean was temporarily jammed by a powerful area of high pressure near Greenland and a storm system in the Central Atlantic, leaving the storm no escape route away from the U.S. Such patterns are known as “blocking” events, and they have occurred with increasing regularity and intensity in recent years. Blocking patterns have been linked to several noteworthy extreme weather events, such as the deadly 2010 Russian heat wave and Pakistan floods, the 2003 European heat wave, and the March heat wave of 2012 in the U.S. In this case, the blocking pattern, occurred at precisely the wrong time — when a hurricane was moving out of the Caribbean. Weather Channel hurricane expert Bryan Norcross wrote about this on Oct. 26. “The freak part is that a hurricane happens to be in the right place in the world to get sucked into this doubled-back channel of air and pulled inland from the coast,” he said. “And the double-freak part is that the upper-level wind, instead of weakening the storm and simply absorbing the moisture — which would be annoying enough — is merging with the tropical system to create a monstrous hybrid vortex. A combination of a hurricane and a nor’easter.” Some, though not all, scientists think the more frequent blocking events may be related to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which is one of the most visible consequences of manmade global warming. The 2012 sea ice melt season, which ended one month ago, was extreme, with sea ice extent, volume, and other measures all hitting record lows. The loss of sea ice opens large expanses of open water, which then absorbs more of the incoming solar energy and adds heat and moisture to the atmosphere, thereby helping to alter weather patterns. Exactly how sub-Arctic weather patterns are changing as a result, however, is a subject of active research. Some researchers who warn that climate change is already being felt in extreme weather events, such as Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., are not yet convinced of the Arctic connection. Others, such as Hayhoe, think it is a “plausible theory” that is worth investigating, although she noted there is evidence that Arctic warming may cause more blocking during the winter rather than during the fall. James Overland, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who recently published a study on how Arctic sea ice loss is altering the weather in the Far North, said it’s not clear whether Hurricane Sandy was just a freak event or a sign of things to come. “What was highly unusual to me was the slowing down of the jet stream that normally turns hurricanes out to sea, allowing Sandy to directly [make] landfall,” he said in an email conversation. Yet, he said it’s important to recognize that there is still a huge role played by randomness, or chaos, in global weather patterns. “Having looked at a lot of weather maps, I don’t think it’s entirely legitimate to make a big possibility for an Arctic connection with Sandy rather than the chaos default,” he said. And while climate change has undoubtedly altered the background conditions in which all weather systems are born, scientists said that natural variability still plays a very large role, and may have been the dominant factor with Hurricane Sandy. Martin Hoerling, a researcher at the Earth Systems Research Laboratory, also in Boulder, is a proponent of this view. “Great events, like this meteorological one, can happen with little cause(s). Individually, neither the tropical storm nor the extratropical storm that embraced it, were unusual,” he said via email. “What makes this a rare, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime event, is the fortuity of their timely (“untimely” as far as most are concerned who sit in harms way) intersection.” Randall M. Dole, who is a colleague of Hoerling's at ESRL, noted that the blocking pattern that helped steer Sandy was "highly transient," which suggests to him that it was just "random bad luck" that it coincided with a hurricane along the East Coast. Regardless of the chain of events that led to this disaster, Hurricane Sandy is almost certain to wind up being one of the top 10 costliest hurricanes on record, and it comes soon after Munich Re, a global insurance giant, warned of increasing natural disaster losses in the U.S., a trend the company said is related to global climate change. And regardless of links between this particular storm and manmade climate change, Hurricane Sandy revealed many pressing questions. Like how much climate change is affecting storm impacts and extreme weather trends, and how vulnerable our coastal populations and infrastructure are to the those changing risks. These are questions that political leaders, scientists, and engineers will be grappling with for many decades to come.

Hurricane Sandy wis the deadliest an maist destructive hurricane o the 2012 Atlantic hurricane saison, as well as the seicont-costliest hurricane in Unitit States history. Classifee'd as the aichteenth named storm, tenth hurricane an seicont major hurricane o the year, Sandy wis a Category 3 storm at its peak intensity when it made landfaw in Cuba.[1] While it wis a Category 2 storm aff the coast o the Northeastren Unitit States, the storm acame the lairgest Atlantic hurricane on record (as measured bi diameter, wi winds spannin 1,100 miles (1,800 km)).[2][3] Preliminary estimates assess damage at nearly $75 billion (2012 USD), a tot surpassed anly bi Hurricane Katrina. At least 285 fowk wur killed alang the path o the storm in seiven kintras.[4] The severe an widespread damage the storm caused in the Unitit States, as well as its unusual merge wi a frontal seestem, resultit in the nicknamin o the hurricane bi the media an several organisations o the U.S. govrenment "Superstorm Sandy".[5][6][7][8] Sandy developed frae a tropical wave in the wastren Caribbean Sea on October 22, quickly strengthened, an wis upgradit tae Tropical Storm Sandy sax oors later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles an gradually intensified. On October 24, Sandy acame a hurricane, made landfaw near Kingston, Jamaica, a few oors later, re-emerged intae the Caribbean Sea an strengthened intae a Category 2 hurricane. On October 25, Sandy hit Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane, then weakened tae a Category 1 hurricane. Early on October 26, Sandy moved throu the Bahamas.[9] On October 27, Sandy briefly weakened tad a tropical storm an then restrengthened tae a Category 1 hurricane. Early on October 29, Sandy curved north-northwest an then[10] moved ashore near Brigantine, New Jersey, juist tae the northeast o Atlantic City, as a post-tropical cyclone wi hurricane-force winds.[1][11] In the United States, Hurricane Sandy affectit 24 states, includin the entire eastren seaboard frae Florida tae Maine an wast across the Appalachian Muntains tae Michigan an Wisconsin, wi parteecularly severe damage in New Jersey an New York. Its storm surge hit New York Ceety on October 29, floodin streets, tunnels an subway lines an cuttin pouer in an aroond the ceety.[13][14] Damage in the US is estimatit at ower $71 billion (2012 USD).[15][16] It forced the release o ower 10 billion gallons o raw an partially treatit sewage 94% o which went intae watters in an aroond New York an New Jersey.[17]
The United States is preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Sandy. The hurricane, which is expected to hit late Sunday into Monday, could affect up to sixty million people. The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that all subway, bus and train services in New York City would be suspended from 19:00 EST on Sunday evening. The hurricane has already caused damage and fatalities in several Caribbean countries this week. Meteorologists are concerned that it will turn into a "Frankenstorm" as it amalgamates with a winter storm in the run up to Halloween. It has now been downgraded to a post-tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center. It has sustained winds of 85 mph. Authorities warned that a full moon could trigger high tides with storm surges of up to 3 metres which would cause sea water to surge through Lower Manhattan. New York mayor Michael Bloomberg urged people to take action now to keep themselves safe. "I don't want anybody to go to bed tonight thinking that they can spend the day worrying about the night after," Mr Bloomberg said. "If you don't evacuate, you are not only endangering your life, you are also endangering the lives of the first responders who are going in to rescue you," he said. It is expected that the hurricane will affect flights. Air France announced that it will cancel all flights to New York and Washington today. British Airways has cancelled all flights to and from the east coast of the U.S. today. The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has announced that several bridges are to close from 19:00 EDT — George Washington, Verrazano-Narrows, Throgs Neck, Whitestone, Henry Hudson, Cross Bay Veterans, and from 16:00 EDT the Tappan Zee. He also said the worst of the storm has not yet reached the city. The state of Delaware has announced a mandatory evacuation order for 50,000 people from coastal areas and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie urged people not to take risks. "We have to be prepared for the worst here. I can be as cynical as any of you but when the storm comes, if it's as bad as they're predicting it will be, you're gonna wish you weren't as cynical as you might otherwise have been." he said. CNN have reported that about 1.5 million people are now being affected by power cuts. The hurricane has also affected the election campaigning plans of the two main presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. Romney announced that he had cancelled a planned campaign rally yesterday evening in Virginia Beach and Vice-President Joe Biden cancelled a visit there on Saturday.

Some researchers who warn that climate change is already being felt in extreme weather events, such as Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., are not yet convinced of the Arctic connection. Others, such as Hayhoe, think it is a “plausible theory” that is worth investigating, although she noted there is evidence that Arctic warming may cause more blocking during the winter rather than during the fall. James Overland, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who recently published a study on how Arctic sea ice loss is altering the weather in the Far North, said it’s not clear whether Hurricane Sandy was just a freak event or a sign of things to come. “What was highly unusual to me was the slowing down of the jet stream that normally turns hurricanes out to sea, allowing Sandy to directly [make] landfall,” he said in an email conversation. Yet, he said it’s important to recognize that there is still a huge role played by randomness, or chaos, in global weather patterns. “Having looked at a lot of weather maps, I don’t think it’s entirely legitimate to make a big possibility for an Arctic connection with Sandy rather than the chaos default,” he said. And while climate change has undoubtedly altered the background conditions in which all weather systems are born, scientists said that natural variability still plays a very large role, and may have been the dominant factor with Hurricane Sandy. Martin Hoerling, a researcher at the Earth Systems Research Laboratory, also in Boulder, is a proponent of this view. “Great events, like this meteorological one, can happen with little cause(s). Individually, neither the tropical storm nor the extratropical storm that embraced it, were unusual,” he said via email. “What makes this a rare, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime event, is the fortuity of their timely (“untimely” as far as most are concerned who sit in harms way) intersection.” Randall M. Dole, who is a colleague of Hoerling's at ESRL, noted that the blocking pattern that helped steer Sandy was "highly transient," which suggests to him that it was just "random bad luck" that it coincided with a hurricane along the East Coast. Regardless of the chain of events that led to this disaster, Hurricane Sandy is almost certain to wind up being one of the top 10 costliest hurricanes on record, and it comes soon after Munich Re, a global insurance giant, warned of increasing natural disaster losses in the U.S., a trend the company said is related to global climate change. And regardless of links between this particular storm and manmade climate change, Hurricane Sandy revealed many pressing questions. Like how much climate change is affecting storm impacts and extreme weather trends, and how vulnerable our coastal populations and infrastructure are to the those changing risks. These are questions that political leaders, scientists, and engineers will be grappling with for many decades to come.
SEA GIRT, N.J. (CBSNewYork/AP) — From the lowest lying areas of the Jersey Shore, where residents were already being encouraged to leave, to the state’s northern highlands, where sandbags were being filled and cars moved into parking lots on high ground, New Jersey began preparing in earnest Friday for Hurricane Sandy. On Friday night, CBS 2 severe weather expert Lonnie Quinn said the storm, still a Category 1 hurricane, would get stronger as it moved north. Quinn said that wind speeds would be near 80 mph as it approaches Virginia and between 65 and 75 mph when it makes landfall, likely somewhere in Delaware. Quinn said that on its current track, the storm would be less than 100 miles from New York City by 8 p.m. Monday. He said the fact that the storm is 2,000 miles wide is a major problem that the area will be dealing with for a while. On the boardwalk, CBS 2’s Emily Smith found piles of sandbags outside of one Point Pleasant Beach businesses along with miles of silt fencing and houses battened down in preparation for the storm. While Point Pleasant Beach wasn’t immediately added to the list of voluntary evacuations, several towns along the Jersey Shore were. The Cape May County Emergency Management Office issued voluntary evacuation orders for Friday and Saturday for barrier islands. Those evacuation orders will become mandatory on Sunday. In Ocean County, the beachfront town of Mantoloking also issued a voluntary evacuation order on Friday, and several other shore towns were considering doing likewise. In Pompton Lakes, town workers were handing out sandbags to residents of flood-prone neighborhoods, and Manville planned to activate its reverse 911 system Friday night, urging people to take precautions as the storm drew nearer. Governor Chris Christie, who was on his way back to the state from a political trip to North Carolina, urged residents to prepare for a “serious storm.” Sandy has the potential to bring five inches of rain or more. New Jersey’s rivers are currently at or below normal levels, but it would only take four inches of rain to send them over their banks, officials said. The slow, calm stream of the Passaic River was nice to look at Friday night, but for residents in low lying Little Falls, living just steps from the river’s banks is nerve wracking. “We have to move all our furniture up to the second level…and find places to store everything,” Tammy Lamontanro told CBS 2’s Derricke Dennis. Tropical Storm Irene was still fresh on everyone’s mind, especially its wind, rain and flooding. Now, Hurricane Sandy is threatening to bring more devastation. “That was horrendous for us, I mean these people down the block, they lose their houses, they lose everything,” Little Falls resident Danny Clark said. “This could be a storm that many have never seen before, including myself,” said Jay Amberg, assistant to the borough administrator in Sea Girt. Crews in Sea Girt were bolstering winter berms and quickly moving sand into mounds meant to protect the shore and the boardwalk. “They will help diffuse the power of waves, save permanent dune structure,” Amberg said. Sandy rolled out of the Bahamas on Friday after causing 40 deaths across the Caribbean, churning toward the U.S. East Coast, where it threatens to join forces with winter weather fronts to create a devastating super storm. Newark Mayor Cory Booker was urging residents to stock up on supplies and prepare for the worst. “The storm itself will be bad, but I worry about the aftermath — people being caught without power,” Booker said. “When you have power outages, it’s not just your ice cream is going to spoil. There are people with medical conditions. There are elderly. A lot of people rely on power.” Utilities were gearing up. Outages that lasted for days after last year’s freak Halloween snowstorm and Hurricane Irene in late August 2011 have been pressuring power companies to be more ready this time. Jersey Central Power & Light, which was criticized for its response to Irene, notified employees to be ready for extended shifts. Public Service Electric and Gas was monitoring Sandy and stepping up emergency preparations. The utility requested more than 1,300 linemen and 600 tree contractors from utilities in other states for assistance. Officials in Belmar were pumping water into the ocean from Silver Lake and Lake Como, a move residents like Ann Murphy hope will save their homes if Hurricane Sandy comes close. While the ocean was calm heading into the weekend, many down the Jersey Shore were worried and were taking Sandy’s threat seriously. “I am thinking this has the potential to be catastrophic with the storm surge. They’re predicting 10-foot storm surge. It’s going to be a full moon,” Belmar resident Jenny Hoffman told CBS 2’s Christine Sloan. The local hardware store in Belmar was packed all day Friday with people coming by for storm necessities. “Batteries, flashlights, generators, which we are sold out right now. A lot of propane,” Taylor Hardware store owner Joe Connor said. Grocery stores were busy, too. “I bought milk and bread, the normal things, and water. And hope it’s going to go to the west,” said Joanne Desheplo, of Belmar. During Hurricane Irene, Belmar, Asbury Park and Spring Lake took a beating. This time around, crews in Asbury Park were taking trash cans off of the boardwalk. “Irene posed some special problems we never encountered in terms of back-area rivers and streams that feed those bay areas because they flooded,” Monmouth County Sheriff Sean Dalton said. From the city to the suburbs, people were bracing for the brunt of the storm. In Hillsdale, just a year after getting hammered by Irene, Jerry Pasinski said he expected to suffer once again. “I’ve seen the heartache,” he told CBS 2’s Steve Langford. Suffering residents in the North Bergen community said the situation could be alleviated if the Woodcliff Lake reservoir were lowered ahead of the storm. It was expected to turn the tiny brook into a torrent of tragedy. But it’s up to the state of New Jersey to issue that order and as of early Friday evening, the state had not committed to sparing the homeowners unnecessary misery.

The odds that New York City will be flooded by a storm, such as a winter nor'easter or a summer hurricane, is now at least 20 times greater than it was 170 years ago, a new study found. It pinned part of the blame on a rising sea level, but also found that other factors are playing a role in escalating the flood risk. The study, accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that a combination of long-term sea level rise, the destruction of wetlands and dredging of waterways as well as possible shifts in storm tracks and strength may all be sharply boosting the risk of dangerously high storm tides. In a sign of the shift to a riskier coastal flood environment in New York, one which is mirrored in many low-lying coastal cities worldwide, the study found that three of the nine highest recorded water levels in the New York Harbor region since 1844 have all occurred since 2010, and eight of the largest 20 such events have occurred since 1990. This is no coincidence, says Stefan Talke, a civil engineer at Portland State University and lead author of the study. The annual probability that a storm, such as a winter nor’easter or a summer hurricane, will overtop the typical Manhattan seawall has increased about 20-fold since 1844, Talke told Mashable, going from less than 1% a year in the 19th century to about 20-25% today. That means that waters can be expected to top the lower Manhattan seawall, which is about 5.7 feet high — once every four to five years, according to a summary from the American Geophysical Union (AGU). That's up from once every 100-400 years back in the late 19th century. In large part because of a 1.4-foot increase in local sea level since 1856, the height of the 10-year flood level has increased by 2.4 feet during that period, the study found. A 10-year flood is one that has a 10% probability of occurring in any given year. Storm tide heights of the highest events in lower Manhattan, showing that Sandy was the highest since 1900. Image: UCAR The issue of how sea level rise and other trends are combining to create a far more perilous coastal existence for cities like New York has taken on a new urgency since Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012, bringing the highest storm tide, which is a measure of the storm surge plus tide level, on record since at least 1821, the study found. Hurricane Sandy cost at least $65 billion, and claimed more than 100 lives. The vast majority of the deaths in New York City were due to drowning, as the Atlantic Ocean temporarily reclaimed land in every borough of the city, especially on Staten Island. In the wake of Sandy, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a $19.5 billion plan to bolster New York's defenses against future sea level rise and storm surges. Whether Mayor Bill de Blasio will follow through on that plan is not yet clear. A steady drumbeat of studies have been published in recent years warning that coastal cities will have to adapt to frequent assaults from the sea, with growing coastal megacities in the developing world facing the biggest challenge. For example, a 2012 study found that an additional 3.3 feet of sea level rise would cause the current 100-year flood event to occur far more frequently along the East Coast, at about once every 20 years. Engineers typically design infrastructure to withstand a 100-year storm, which means that if 100-year events become more frequent, buildings, railways, and bridges may not be strong enough. Talke told Mashable that while sea level rise likely accounts for a significant amount of the added coastal flooding risk in New York, other dynamics are also at work. Over the past 150 years, he said, there were other major manmade changes to New York Harbor as the city grew. For example, New York lost 85% of its wetlands during that period, and these helped to blunt the impact of a major storm surge. In addition, the shipping channel between Sandy Hook, New Jersey and Raritan Bay used to be just 24 feet deep in the 1800s, whereas they have been doubled in order to accommodate large container and cruise ships. The deeper water can increase wave heights during a storm event, Talke says. “[It] basically decreases the drag on an incoming wave, and is as if you had switched from a VW bus to an aerodynamic car,” Talke said. “You can go faster, and lose less energy. From the point of view of a wave, that means you are getting higher.” 500,000 data points For the study, Talke and his coauthors at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey undertook a painstaking examination of nearly 500,000 data points from tide gauge records to find the maximum water level reached during each year. Some time periods required correcting for data biases known to affect certain types of tide gauges, and the scientists checked their data against the New York Times archives to make sure they did not miss any major storm events. According to Talke, water level measurements in the late 1800s were nearly as accurate as those taken today. Water levels used to be measured using gauges that employed a stilling well, which is “basically a pipe with holes at the bottom.” This pipe would act to remove the effects of wind and waves. “Until at least the early 1990s in the U.S., a float on the water moved up and down, and was connected to a pencil via a chain and some gearing. The pencil moved up and down on a scroll as the tide moved up and down, and a continuous trace of the tide was measured by moving the scroll forward in time with a clock,” Talke said. “These days the tide can be measured by radar, pneumatically, or [through] other means, but one still needs a method of removing the effect of waves.” Talke says that one of the problems that plagued early tide gauge measurements in New York was the tendency of the harbor to freeze up much more widely and frequently than it does today, in another reflection of the warming the region has experienced.

TUCKERTON, N.J. — When Michael Savage trudged up to his beach bungalow near Tuckerton Bay days after Hurricane Sandy, the smell of rotting fish hit him immediately. Two freezers of tuna caught a few weeks before had turned over, spilling blood and fish into the floodwater and soaking furniture, rugs, and less replaceable belongings, like photos and baby books. The oak wood floors had buckled up like a mountain. More coverage Savage turned to his wife, Carol, and said the words hundreds of people would utter in the months after Sandy hit five years ago: “We have to tear it all down.” Now, the Savages’ home is about 10 feet higher — elevated to conform with new building requirements to minimize future flood damage. It’s a mini-mansion in the changing blue-collar fishing town, larger and more “beachy” than some of the houses nearby. Up and down the New Jersey coastline, houses have gotten bigger, taller, and, with few exceptions, pricier since Sandy pummeled the Shore on Oct. 29, 2012. Year-round ownership continues to decline as buyers snap up second homes, undeterred by the possibility of another devastating storm. Median home prices have risen, with few exceptions, since before Sandy, according to Zillow. In Tuckerton, a mainland borough in Ocean County, the overall change was gradual: Houses sold for an average of $170,500 in August 2012, compared with $198,000 last August. But by the bay, where most of the newer houses have been built, they’re going for $400,000 to $500,000, prices the town has never seen before. “All the little two-bedroom bungalows are being replaced with four- or five- or six-bedroom elevated houses,” said Karen O’Neill, a professor of human ecology at Rutgers New Brunswick, author of Taking Chances: The Coast After Hurricane Sandy. Michael Savage The Savages’ Tuckerton home before the storm. “More and more communities are seeing residences flip from year-round to seasonal — especially in less wealthy communities — and different people are moving in,” O’Neill said. “The storms wiped out the poorer homeowners who didn’t have flood insurance or who couldn’t afford to rebuild.” Those who could, faced with new height requirements, figured if they were going taller, they might as well go bigger, as well. Sandy damaged or destroyed at least 650,000 homes. About 346,000 of them were in New Jersey, according to insurance claims filed with the state. The storm, categorized as a hurricane while it was offshore and then a “superstorm” after it made landfall, caused $71.5 billion in economic damage, making it, at the time, the second-costliest hurricane in U.S. history after Hurricane Katrina, according to the National Hurricane Center. Damage from Hurricane Harvey this year is expected to surpass that from Sandy. It would be wrong to attribute all the fancy new houses to the storm. The Shore’s housing stock was aging out long before Sandy hit. Houses passed down from one generation to the next became harder to keep up, and the culture of spending entire summers at the Shore had changed for many families. Developers realized decades ago that they could build two houses where one aging cottage with a big backyard once stood, increasing their resale value or rental prospects. But Sandy speeded things up. Shore Real Estate After Sandy Median home prices in many communities along the Jersey Shore are significantly higher now than they were in August 2012, two months before Hurricane Sandy struck the coast. Other factors contributed to the increase — including low interest rates and housing market confidence, along with the natural aging out of older homes, which started long before Sandy. The map shows locations of Shore zip codes from Ocean County south to Cape May County. Click on the markers on the map for more information. SOURCE: Zillow Staff Graphic “It wasn’t random; the storm took down homes that were older and built to different codes,” said Kevin Gillen, a senior economic adviser at Houwzer, a Philadelphia real estate agency. “Sandy has accelerated the Shore’s gentrification by knocking down the least-valuable homes. Meanwhile, over decades, beachfront land became more valuable.” The Savages added a widow’s walk and two upstairs circular balconies to the back of their home. There’s an outdoor elevator to hoist up groceries, and, at times, Mike Savage’s 99-year-old mother when she comes to visit. Being up high has its advantages: The green-headed flies don’t swarm up there, not to mention the view. CLEM MURRAY / Staff Photographer Carol and Mike Savage, both 65, added a widow’s walk to their rebuilt home. Their old home was destroyed by Sandy’s surge up Tuckerton Creek. To get the house they wanted, the Savages had to hire an engineering firm from Avalon, where the median house price rose from $951,000 in 2012 to $1.2 million today. “They all thought I was crazy to build this here,” Mike Savage said. “The builders here weren’t building the way we wanted this. Now, you go down to the bay, you see some pretty nice homes.” In towns like Avalon, the houses that inspired the Savages’ design are getting bigger. Jack Vizzard, a real estate broker there, said the town continues to attract second-home owners from the Philadelphia suburbs, South Jersey, and, increasingly, North Jersey and New York. “They come down, and they don’t even blink at the number, even though Avalon’s pretty pricey,” Vizzard said. “What costs $7 million here costs $21 million in the Hamptons, and … it probably takes about the same time to get here.” Vizzard, who lives year-round in Avalon and is a firefighter there, has sold to families whose Shore homes were wiped out in Point Pleasant or Long Beach Island. They tried Avalon for a summer, he said, and liked it. Anthony Marotta, a Realtor in Margate, said business is booming there. “They’re taking down tiny little saltboxes and building 2,500-square-foot second homes.” He was quick to attribute much of the development to low interest rates and people having more confidence in the housing market. In Avalon, for example, only six houses out of 5,000 were reported damaged by Sandy, yet 368 have gone up since then, borough clerk Marie Hood said. “Margate has always been affluent,” Marotta said, “but you drive through today, you’ll see no less than 15 Bentley convertibles running around in any given weekend. That wasn’t the case three years ago.” Lower-income towns, like Brigantine, with more year-round residents, are not seeing the kind of rapid home appreciation as other towns. Median home values there decreased from $309,100 in August 2012 to $287,000 in August. Tuckerton was an early U.S. port and historically a clamming and fishing village. Of the 618 houses in the Tuckerton Beach special flood zone area, 90 percent were damaged or destroyed. As of September, 219 new houses — defined as those that were substantially improved or raised to meet new code requirements — went up in town. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that Sandy wiped away many of the blighted or abandoned houses, Tuckerton municipal construction official Phil Reed said. Bigger houses replaced them, meaning more taxable property. “At the end of it, we’ll be a much better, more resilient community,” Reed said. “The end could be another five years away, and God forbid we get hit with another one.” Tuckerton is still composed of a majority of year-round owners, but by the bay, more seasonal homeowners are moving in. “We’re seeing basically young, working professionals, people we used to call yuppies, dual-income, no kids, building very elaborate houses, well above the minimums, to a different standard than we’re used to seeing,” Reed said. “We have a lot less empty storefronts, and older storefronts in town are starting to get rehabbed.” Pinelands Brewing Co. opened up two years ago two miles from the bay, and a cross-fit gym and cafe with connected art gallery opened recently. Reed estimates 15 percent of homeowners with damage decided they couldn’t rebuild. “Older generations that had these houses paid five or 10 thousand for them. They can’t fathom $300,000.” Jim Marra Jim Marra’s home before it was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy. Jim Marra and his wife, Mary Ella, walked away from their home on Parker Road in Tuckerton after Sandy dealt them a double dose of grief. At the same time the storm took out their vacation home dating to 1972, an oak tree fell onto the roof of their two-story Dutch Colonial in Upper Dublin in Montgomery County. Marra, a professor at Temple for 28 years, had just retired. Faced with having to rebuild two houses, the Marras decided to raze their flooded-out bungalow and sell. One of the deciding factors was how high they’d have to build and how the stairs might affect them as they got older. Now, one of the highest houses on the block, a 2,600-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-bath structure raised 12 feet, sits where Marra’s family cottage once stood. Carmen Cutro, 50, bought the lot for $160,000 from the Marras. He estimates he spent close to $500,000 on the lot and the house. “It’s amazing up and down the block, almost kind of like a new rejuvenation. Something’s going up every day,” he said CLEM MURRAY / Staff Photographer Carmen Cutro’s new home, which he built after buying the plot where Jim Marra’s small beach bungalow once stood. The home overlooks Little Egg Harbor in Tuckerton Beach. Marra was faced with the unpredictability of future storms, his own age, and a weakening connection to a town that had grown less familiar. Yet five years later, he still wonders whether selling was the right call. “You know, the home had been in our family for so long. I don’t think we gave that enough thought — the significance of that,” he said. “All you want is some resolution in your life at that point.”
Video: Hurricane Sandy Victim Discusses Becoming "Suddenly Homeless" As we reported this week, many families who were evacuated from their homes because of Hurricane Sandy won't find a permanent place to stay for months. And as Mayor Bloomberg learned quite viscerally yesterday at the St. Patrick's Day parade in the Rockaways, there are a lot of folks who are very angry about the way the city has handled the fallout. One such person dealing with the worst of this bureaucracy is Vicki, a social worker for homeless people whose home was destroyed in the storm, leaving her and her 9-year-old daughter homeless themselves. In the video above, taken as she was begging for money on the A Train, Vicki discusses the shock of becoming "suddenly homeless" and the difficulty of living on public assistance: "Cory Booker can't do it, he's the Mayor of Newark, he's a single man, a vegetarian, living on a potato every day! How do they expect me and my 9-year-old to do it?" Just two weeks ago, Bloomberg discussed the city's homeless population—despite a controversial new policy that allows the city to turn away families with nowhere else to go when the temperature has dipped below freezing, Bloomberg claimed, "we’re three to 10 times more compassionate than the other cities" when it comes to homelessness. The city says they'll spend $955 million on homeless services in the next fiscal year, but it's unclear how that money will be distributed, or whether Sandy victim will be aided as well. As Vicki puts it, there needs to be more safety nets in place in the future to protect New Yorkers: "This could have happened to anybody though. It's not like a moral deficiency. It's not like I did it, like I did something." She added: "That's what's so frightening about the whole thing. It could be Donald Trump. It could be anybody."

Gasoline Panic 10:06 am, Sunday, November 4, 2012 Reuters writes: Gas shortages are prompting some angry confrontations among drivers waiting in long lines for the potentially life-saving resource. Police patrolled gas stations in a city-wide effort to prevent violence as panicked residents waited their turn at the pump. Weather forecasts for this weekend added urgency to the situation—temperatures are projected to decrease over the next few days. Meanwhile, New Jersey high school students have generated a map to help residents find open gas stations: mappler.net/gasstation/ --Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato Credit: Tanzilya Mandrikova The Scene in Brighton Beach 5:13 pm, Saturday, November 3, 2010 Brighton Beach, the historically Russian neighborhood that sits on the Atlantic Ocean in Brooklyn, grappled with heavy flooding and electrical fires in the wake of Sandy. City officials had ordered residents to evacuate before the storm, but few did, citing little damage following last year's Hurricane Irene. Our babysitter, who lives in the neighborhoood, took these photos Tuesday evening. They show the beach strewn with debris, including a sofa and a refrigerator. The boardwalk, where residents stroll and gather to play Credit: Tanzilya Mandrikova dominoes, was piled high with sand. The tide had lifted up parked cars and set them askew in the streets. As in many neighborhoods in New York and New Jersey, trees fell and businesses and cars burned; some stores were looted. Many residents talked about how quickly the water had rushed into their homes during the storm. Our sitter, Tanya Mandrikova, who lives on the third floor of an Credit: Tanzilya Mandrikova apartment building, began panicking as water rushed down her street and began to rise. "I left my apartment and stood in the hallway in my nightgown" because she couldn't bear to watch, she said. Once the water began to retreat, a few hours later, her neighbors celebrated. Parts of Brighton Beach lost power and running water after the storm, but electricity has since been restored to many homes. Some buildings remain without heat, however, due to basement flooding. This weekend, temperatures in Brooklyn were expected to fall to a low of 33 degrees Fahrenheit. --Anna Kuchment Eerily Dark Jersey 7:28 pm, Friday, November 2, 2010 Credit: Michael Battaglia More than 1.5 million customers still lacked electricity in New Jersey as of Friday, November 2.

With more than 6 million* homes and businesses in 15 states without power as of Wednesday evening as a result of this storm, it's important to pay attention to food safety and preparation. Refrigerated foods should be thrown away if your household has experience a power outage of four hours or longer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention. Frozen perishable items fare better during power outages, but do not eat foods that have been thawing for more than 48 hours. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to pathogens. If using formula, make sure to prepare the mixture with bottled or boiled water. The center also recommends that any foods contaminated by storm waters be discarded. Accuweather published some data this morning on the highest rainfall totals by state, highest wind gusts by state, highest snowfall by state and top storm surges due to Sandy. The data reveal some of this storm's hard-won lessons. It was storm surge, not rainfall, that marked the extremes that wrought the most damage in New York City. Snow was an issue in the Mid-Atlantic region, not in the Northeast. Long Island was punished by extreme wind gusts and storm surge, more than by rainfall. Cities and towns along Long Island sound were hammered by the top wind gusts (Eatons Neck, NY, came in No. 1; and Madison, R.I., came in No. 4) and top storm surges (Kings Point, NY, came in No. 1 and New Haven, Conn., came in No. 3).

Enterprise was a full-scale shuttle used to test plans for the fleet of space shuttles that followed and carried astronauts for 135 missions, including one that delivered the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit and others focused on repairing and upgrading the telescope. After long stints in a hangar near Dulles International Airport in Virginia and at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles, Enterprise was flown to New York City earlier this year and eventually transported to and hoisted onto the Intrepid, located on a pier in the Hudson River along the West Side of Manhattan. The shuttle's temporary shelter was damaged during Sandy, and the shuttle sustained some damage to its vertical stabilizer. --Robin Lloyd Explainer--Flood Waters Pose Health Concerns 5:50pm EDT Tuesday, October 30, 2012 Most of us fear deep water, but even shallow flood waters pose a threat if they are moving, carrying debris or hiding downed electrical wires. In metropolitan areas especially, water can also harbor raw sewage, infectious organisms, gasoline and harmful chemicals. People in areas flooded by Sandy should follow recommendations by FEMA on Ready.gov/floods to avoid flood waters and make sure their water supply is safe to drink. Water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever and vector-borne diseases such as West Nile can increase after a flood, according to the World Health Organization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that flood waters can conceal sharp debris. Flood waters tested after Hurricane Katrina held lead, arsenic, chromium and fecal coliform bacteria and other hazards, researchers reported in Environmental Science & Technology in 2005. Contaminant levels were not as high as feared—concentrations were similar to that in typical rainwater runoff—but the sheer volume of water puts more people at risk. The U.S. Department of Energy posted an emergency situation report (pdf) on Sandy’s impact in each affected state. As of 9 A.M. this morning, more than 8 million people had lost power.

Credit: U.S. Department of Energy; Jen Christiansen, Scientific American --Robin Lloyd List of Sandy-Related Disaster Resources 4:40pm EDT Tuesday, October 30, 2012 Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath has left millions without power, started a fire in Queens, N.Y. and others throughout the city, toppled trees, damaged and destroyed homes and property and endangered lives. Potentially dozens of people in the U.S. and at least 69 in the Caribbean have been killed during the storm. Resources For housing, the Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends searching for open shelters by texting SHELTER and a Zip Code to 43362 (4FEMA) Ex: Shelter 01234 (std rates apply). FEMA also has a disaster assistance program to provide financial aid for those in need of temporary housing, repair and replacement for destroyed homes. Google has pulled together a crisis map that includes power outage information, shelters, weather radar and more. The following is journalist Brian Patrick Eha's experience of Tropical Storm Sandy, in his own words. What's that Mark Twain quote people like to share about throwing off the bowlines, sailing away from the safe harbor and exploring? It's a scientific fact that the best place to be in a hurricane is somewhere else, but if you're willing to risk the wind and rain and flying debris, a storm like Sandy does give you a chance to see your city in a way you've never seen it before. All night I'd been glued to my Twitter feed, watching with mounting disbelief as the reports poured in: lower Manhattan was blacked out; Brooklyn Bridge Park was underwater; the New York University hospital was being evacuated. In my Harlem apartment, I still had power, which seemed unfair. I needed to experience what was happening firsthand. At 10:30 pm I began heading south on Broadway from 151st Street, then cut over to Riverside Drive, intent on reaching the Hudson River, which had, I'd heard, been rising steadily at both ends. The rain had abated momentarily but the gusting winds remained strong. The main gate to the park at 145th Street was closed, so I doubled back to 148th, where I descended a winding stone staircase slippery with leaves. Crossing an elevated walkway over railroad tracks I came upon a group of young men and women who were mugging for a handheld camera, giving a fake news broadcast about the storm. They hadn't yet mustered up the courage to descend. When I reached the riverbank, I found that someone had gotten there first. His name was Will...This human contact where I had expected none took me by surprise; we fell into a fragmented conversation like two survivors at the end of all things. New Jersey was in darkness, and from time to time an unearthly green glow lit the clouds on the horizon. "Did you see the video of that transformer blowing up?" I asked Will. He hadn't. Wind lashed us, harrying leaves to the water. The trees overhead, still wearing autumn foliage, streamed out like banners. Here and there on the swollen waters, which lay in a blue haze, were the floodlamps of search-and-rescue boats. Time and again, the lampposts in the park died down to sodium-yellow cat's eyes, then gradually flared to life again. After Will departed, I headed south along the river and soon reached an empty stretch of grass by the water's edge with an unobstructed view of the farther shore. To my left was the pedestrian walkway, still lighted, that leads from 145th Street to Riverbank State Park, and the concrete superstructure that supports its playground and boardwalk. I found a large rock and sat down by the water, exposed to the elements. Disaster updates were still lighting up my cell phone, but Sandy was lessening. Alone, I nevertheless felt myself bound in a common fate with the millions in darkness. On my rock, I kept a kind of vigil. Gradually I watched the storm subside. --Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato News Update—Department of Energy Reports on Power Outages 11:56am EDT, Tuesday, October 30, 2012 The U.S. Department of Energy has posted an emergency situation report (pdf) on Sandy’s impact in each affected state. As of 9am this morning, more than 8 million people have lost power. New Jersey has been particularly hard hit—the state has shut down two nuclear power units and 62 percent of the state’s population is without electricity. The report also describes current efforts to restore power. We’re working on a graphic to show the outages in each state. The Raleigh Bureau is turning in for the night but we’ll continue our coverage tomorrow morning. Stay safe everyone! Weird Weather-- Hurricane Sandy Is Weird 10:54pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Sandy has got some pretty peculiar characteristics. Scientific American spoke with Philip Bedient, a hydrologist at Rice University to explore a few of Sandy's many oddities. Sandy is a late bloomer: "What's unusual is that it's hitting this late in the season. It's a real surprise to a lot of folks." Sandy is speedy: "These things form very quickly, and this thing's moving about 28 mph. That's actually very fast for a hurricane." Sandy is tough: "I think the storm surge gets the people off guard. It's much higher than I've ever seen. This may be the worst flooding from a hurricane for a long, long time." For more coverage of the storm, follow Scientific American online at @sciam. --Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato My First Storm-- Kat Overland 10:45pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Houston treats hurricanes how northern cities treat snow -- it has to be a pretty significant amount of precipitation for people to worry. That means that getting the day off of school meant some pretty severe weather was on its way. I was in 2nd grade when Hurricane Allison was on its way, but my best friend and I were mostly excited about having the day off of school. She came over and we spent most of the day playing "hurricane emergency" in my bathroom, the only room in my house without windows (we were kind of weird kids). Her mom had to pick her up before the water got too high, though. My dad went to bed, because he can sleep through anything, but mom and I were kept up by the winds and the heavy rain. I live in an area fairly vulnerable to flooding -- about forty minutes out from Galveston beach, but downtown ended up getting hit the hardest. Mom and I watched the news early in the morning the next day. The image that sticks in my mind the most was watching people garbage bags and bins floating down the street, though luckily the water only came right up to the front door and not inside the house. --Kat Overland Explainer--How animals survive storms 10:08 pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Credit: Thomas Hawk Humans take shelter and stock up on supplies during hurricanes, but how do wild critters of the land, air and sea deal with extreme weather? On land, the most resilient species are those that can find food even in a storm-torn environment. In the wake of Hurricane Dean (a Category 5 storm), Mexican and Canadian researchers recorded animal signs (digging marks, hair, feathers, feces) and tracks in the months before and after the storm. Indeed, omnivores including armadillos rebounded quicker than herbivores such as white-tailed deer. The researchers reported their findings in 2011 in the journal Biotropica. Birds are sometimes blown astray, but many have a strategy. Breeding colonies in the Pearl River basin lost habitat after Hurricane Katrina but researchers noted in the journal Forest Ecology and Management that those bird numbers didn’t decline, suggesting that the resident populations know how to deal with hurricanes. Some birds are especially adept: Scientists at the Center for Conservation Biology tracked a migratory shorebird, a whimbrel, as it flew through Hurricane Irene in 2011. –Marissa Fessenden Explainer—The consequences of downgrading Sandy 9:48pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Sandy is still packing a punch, clocking in with wind speeds of 80 mph, but the National Hurricane Center has downgraded the wild weather from hurricane to "tropical storm." Why the switch? The center uses a sliding scale called "Saffir-Simpson" to categorize storms. The scale is based solely on windspeed so when Sandy lost power, it also lost its hurricane status. The lesser label is a problem for scientists who study storm surges and public officials who have to evacuate entire populations because of flooding. Just because a hurricane is downgraded to a storm, doesn't mean it's any less deadly, said Noah Diffenbaugh a climate scientist at Stanford University. "We have plenty of examples of lower category storms that cause a greater level of damage and higher category storms that cause a lower level of damage," he added. That's because storms are gradually getting worse, said Philip Bedient, a hydrologist at Rice University. Half a century ago, wind speed was an accurate measurement of storm intensity. Now, as storms grow larger and more intense, their impacts might have outgrown the scale. "We're getting these really huge storms," Rice said. "They can have enormous storm surge effects compared to what we saw back in the '50s and '60s." The meteorological community has proposed other forms of measurement, but some researchers stand in staunch support of Saffir-Simpson. Scientific American previously covered the Saffir-Simpson debate in “Are Category 6 Hurricanes Coming Soon?” --Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato Hurricane Fact or Fiction—Crack a window during the storm? 9:05 pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 There’s an urban legend that suggests keeping windows shut during a hurricane causes pressure to build up in a home until the building’s roof pops off. The logic goes that you should open your window just a smidge, to “equalize pressure.” Snopes.com offers argues against this home remedy and suggests that opening a window could cause worse damage. Those high winds may not only break your prize china, they could push against structural weak points which could compromise your home. However, Rice University hydrologist Philip Bedient disagrees. He explains that as hurricanes move into an area, atmospheric pressure can plummet by nearly 10 percent. Generally, the pressure outside your house is lower than the pressure inside your house, but when there’s a sudden drop in outside pressure there can be problems. “It could basically blow out your windows,” Bedient says. “It happens all the time.” Bedient also acknowledges that opening your window is a risk-- allowing 90 mile per hour winds into your home is not the best strategy either. Scenes from Sandy--Bayville, New York 8:55pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Credit: Oliver Rich Weird Weather--What can Sandy tell us about climate change? 8:42pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 "A lot of the (hurricane) damage is a function of the human response, whether they evacuate and whether they're prepared. We learn a lot about the vulnerability of people for these types of events. Those insights are very relevant for understanding how people may respond to a changing climate." The eye of Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy made landfall just past 8pm this evening in Southern New Jersey. Winds remain at 80 miles per hour. News Update—Sandy becomes a Post-Tropical Storm 8:10 pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 The National Hurricane Center has announced that Sandy is transforming from a hurricane into a post-tropical cyclone. As they explain in their release, a hurricane's energy comes from the ocean and heat release above the storm center. A post-tropical storm's energy comes from shifts in temperature in the atmosphere. CBS news covers the transition, observing that Sandy's winds and storm surge are still strong. News Update—Coastal Transformation 6:56pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Credit: Gerard Marrone How will the storm re-shape the shore? The USGS released a statement this morning that as much as 93 percent of the coastline in Long Island and 98 percent in New Jersey could experience dune erosion. As the waves erode dunes they leave the beach vulnerable to further erosion. The beaches stretching south from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware along Maryland and Virginia may face the most significant changes. Scenes from Sandy--Marblehead, Massachussetts 1:30pm EDT 6:02pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Credit: Brian Birke News Update—Preparing for the storm 5:49pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Tonight, probably after 8pm EDT, Sandy’s center will reach land. As the storm approaches, it’s critical for people in affected areas to follow local instructions regarding evacuations and preparedness. Scientific American’s David Biello describes the situation in New York City. Not all hurricanes are the same —Sandy, for example, is more than a thousand miles in diameter— but they share a common structure. Surrounding the calm eye of the storm, a hurricane’s eyewall harbors the most violent winds and intense precipitation. Eyewalls of long-lived storms can contract and a new eyewall may form. Hurricane Andrew ratcheted up to Category 5 as it hit land in 1992 and built a new eyewall. Researchers based at the University of Rhode Island developed an online resource covering hurricane science, which includes this explanation of hurricane structure and contributions from middle and high school teachers. --Marissa Fessenden Weird Weather-- Hurricane Sandy is weird. 5:17pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Hurricane Sandy has an asymmetrical wind field, which means its most powerful winds are located in the left-rear quadrant. Most storms of Sandy’s caliber are strongest in the front, right quadrant. “What’s interesting about the storm is it’s undergoing an extra-tropical transition,” said Forrest Masters, a wind engineer at the University of Florida. “Sandy’s a slightly different animal than we’ve been looking at in the past.” The switch makes it difficult for Masters’ team to track the storm as it heads toward their southern New Jersey base. It also means that when Sandy first hits land, East Coast residents are only experiencing partial wind load and might misjudge the severity of the storm.* This evening, Hurricane Sandy is expected to make landfall in southeast New Jersey. Reuters reports that at least two New Jersey nuclear power plants in the storm’s path will likely be shut down. Monitoring of the situation is ongoing—but the shut down would knock out about 19 percent of the state’s electricity. A quick search through the scientific literature suggests the claim isn’t new (see this 1985 study in The Journal of Reproductive Medicine) but it is contentious. In 2007, a study in the Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics suggested that deliveries might increase on days with a marked change in barometric pressure. But exactly how that relationship worked was unclear. A 2005 study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, however, found no relationship between atmospheric conditions and birth rate. While the jury may be out on this—there’s more obvious (and scientifically defensible) worries about hurricanes and pregnant women. Stress is a big one, as is dehydration. The CDC offers a fact sheet on disaster preparedness for expecting mothers that touches on a few of these points. --Daisy Yuhas Q&A-- a wind engineer, "Storms don't have to cause damage" 4:15 pm EDT Monday, October 29, 2012 Credit: Christine Gorman, Scientific American University of Florida wind engineer Forrest Masters has been in 25 major storms since 1999. He’s built a career on measuring the metrics of hurricanes, planting his equipment in the path of oncoming super storms to learn more about how they function. Masters has a team of researchers stationed in southern New Jersey, waiting for Hurricane Sandy. Scientific American interviewed Masters about his contributions to the field. [An edited transcript follows] Q: You go into the path of oncoming storms to take measurements. How does that work? We deploy rugged weather stations to measure surface level turbulence in suburban communities with the objective of basically measuring important properties that affect building performance. We’re trying to quantify how the wind varies with time. That’s important because damage to residential buildings is an issue. The U.S. has experienced more than $110 billion in insured loss because of inadequate building performance, and we need to get a handle on how we characterize pressure loads on structures. Q: How do you use the data you collect? Ultimately these data give us a better baseline on the environmental conditions during hurricanes. We use this information to make better decisions about building communities. We’re trying to make communities more resilient and in order to do that we have to have more accurate information. Q: What’s the biggest misconception about hurricanes? The biggest myth is that damage caused in hurricanes is unavoidable. We have the means and the technologies to prevent significant losses in hurricanes. We haven’t realized that yet. A lot of people assume that hurricanes are acts of god. Q: What is it like being outside in a hurricane? I’ve done it enough times that it’s not a rush. It’s work. It’s overwhelming. Being in the storm is one thing but actually seeing the effects of the storm, being there in the aftermath, how people’s lives are affected — that affects me far more than the storm itself. Hurricane Sandy is on track to make history, but some weather sticks with you for more personal reasons. My first storm is also my first memory. It was September and my parents were half an hour away, at their alma mater's homecoming, leaving my brother and I in the capable hands of our favorite babysitter. I was two years old, so this memory is more constructed than true. A fearsome thunderstorm, not uncommon during summers in Upstate New York took out the power. I remember it was dark and the babysitter held my baby brother and I on the blue couch in our living room. Cracks of thunder shook the house. That's all I remember. I must have been terrified for this experience to stamp itself on to my mind. My mom tells me that our babysitter took us into the basement when a branch fell on the power transformer across the road. Arcing and sparks threatened to start a fire. Wind ripped one of the doors off a barn on the family dairy farm. Forage wagons, used to harvest corn or hay, blew across a field and into our back yard. I also remember a blizzard in 1993 that struck late in the season. My mom reminded me that my dad and uncle worked for 36 hours, caring for and milking about 500 cows every 12 hours by themselves. My uncle drove a tractor through the seven-foot drifts in our driveway to pick up my dad. The milk truck came just in time to empty the bulk tank--they were an hour away from dumping milk down the drain. I remember sledding down the piles of snow. School was closed for a week. I measure all winters against that one and have been disappointed ever since. --Marissa Fessenden The views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Power outages at hundreds of gas stations and a distribution bottleneck due to flooding damage and power loss has caused a gasoline shortage in the New York metropolitan area that may not be cleared up for at least a week, according to industry experts. Motorists fumed in long lines at gas stations around the New York area and screamed at each other Friday as fuel shortages hindered the region's efforts to recover from Super Storm Sandy. But in a move toward normalcy, Atlantic City's casinos were allowed to reopen. In the wake of Sandy’s aftermath, startups based on New York City have had to relocate to keep operations running. With so many Silicon Alley offices located in Lower Manhattan, where power has been out for days, finding a remote hideout with wifi has been critical. New Yorkers felt the rumble of subway trains for the first time in four days on Thursday but gasoline shortages persisted in the Northeast and emergency crews struggled to reach the worst-hit areas and restore power to millions of people. As our thoughts remain with all those who have been horribly affected by the devastation that hit the U.S. Eastern seaboard and its aftermath, we are being asked about the implications of Hurricane Sandy for markets Hurricane Sandy smacked the East Coast then turned into Super Storm Sandy. Now, thousands of travelers are no doubt calling her Pain in the Neck Sandy. This, as some airports start operating as normal again others are a long ways from having a regular schedule. The offices of the Federal Reserve banks of New York and Philadelphia are nearly empty. But the staffs of the banks, as well as the Board of the Federal Reserve in New York, are working from home to keep the U.S. financial system flowing smoothly. It happened after hurricane Katrina, and the expectation is that Sandy will prove no different. “Demand for self-storage rises considerably as homeowners, contractors, and local suppliers set about preparing for reconstruction,” note analysts David Toti and Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald. Traders at hedge funds frustrated by the lack of access to equities markets in the United States have been combing through the world for proxies, assets they might be able to trade that are so correlated with certain U.S. equity classes that traders can synthetically reproduce the trades they can't make in U.S. markets. These are few and far between, of course. “Going forward we are going to have to anticipate these types of extreme weather patterns,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference Tuesday morning. “And we have to think about how we redesign the system so that this doesn’t happen again.”
Another superstorm could hit New York on the five-year anniversary of Sandy There is no official definition of a superstorm, though the term is commonly used by meteorologists and journalists to describe the phenomenon of tropical and nontropical weather systems converging to form a larger storm. In October 2012, a perfect storm of rapid-pressure changes, low wind shear, and a full-moon high tide led the formation of the most infamous superstorm in recent memory: Superstorm Sandy. Sandy was the deadliest northeast US hurricane since 1972 and the second most expensive on record after Katrina. According to the National Hurricane Center, there is potential for a superstorm to form in the northeast again this weekend, the fifth anniversary of Sandy’s landfall. The distant factors that could bring a superstorm A recent tropical wave “disturbance” in Central America, a low-pressure trough moving across the eastern US, and a large dip in the jet stream caused by Typhoon Lan in the Pacific could merge with each other over the northeast in the next few days to form into one huge storm. The National Hurricane Center sees a 40% chance of such a storm forming over the next five days, saying “environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for some development on Friday and Saturday.” Strong winds could break apart the system on Sunday, though heavy rain is expected across the Caribbean even if it does. If the systems do merge, the mid-Atlantic up to New England could experience tropical storm-force winds and major flooding this weekend, though almost definitely not at the same magnitude as Sandy, the largest storm ever to form in the Atlantic. Here’s what could happen According to forecasts from CNN meteorologists, the tropical wave in the Caribbean could move across Florida on Saturday (dumping heavy rain over areas still recovering from Irma), then quickly move north up the coast, pushed by a dip in the upper-level trough in the jet stream. The same upper-level trough, as well was warm ocean water, could provide energy for the system to strengthen. Then dense air from a cold front in the eastern US could combine with the less-dense warm air of the the tropical system, creating low atmospheric pressure—which often leads to severe weather if enough moisture is present in the air.

Displaced by Hurricane Sandy, and Living in Limbo Before Hurricane Sandy, Kathryn Fitzgerald lived with her young daughter, Megan, in a modest three-bedroom house in Long Beach, N.Y. But after the storm, their house was torn down.Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times LONG BEACH, N.Y. — For Kathryn Fitzgerald and her young daughter, Megan, home was a modest three-bedroom house here, on a tightly packed segment of Delaware Avenue two blocks from the Atlantic Ocean. That was the only home that Megan had ever known, until Hurricane Sandy hit and a rank mixture of floodwater and untreated sewage rose to chest-high in the lower level of the house. Since then, they have lived in rental apartments and Megan, now 9, attended an unfamiliar school in another town for a while as her mother appealed for enough aid to rebuild the life they had. When inspectors arrived at Ms. Fitzgerald’s house in November 2012, they pronounced her house “substantially damaged,” meaning that more than half of its value had been destroyed overnight. But her homeowner’s insurance policy did not cover flood damage. She had a federally subsidized flood insurance policy, but the company that wrote it offered her just $71,000. She appealed, arguing that her three-bedroom house had been worth more than double that, but her appeal was denied. She appealed again, and was again denied. Lacking the wherewithal to start overhauling her house and believing that it was too vulnerable to another big storm, Ms. Fitzgerald paid $11,500 to have it torn down. Now she owns a sandlot surrounded by a fence bearing a sign that warns against trespassing. “This has been a horrendously hard year for me,” she said. “If I don’t think of this in a way that is going to relieve the anger and upset, then I’ll just go back to crying every day.” More than a year after one of the country’s largest-ever disaster recovery efforts began, Ms. Fitzgerald is among the more than 30,000 residents of New York and New Jersey who remain displaced by the storm, mired in a bureaucratic and financial limbo. Imposing on relatives and draining their savings while pleading for assistance from a dizzying array of government agencies, they say they fear they will never get home. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it had provided $1.4 billion in direct aid to victims of the storm and $7.9 billion in flood insurance payouts, and that the Small Business Administration had made $2.4 billion in low-interest loans to homeowners and businesses. What it did not announce was that less than half of the people who sought emergency money received any, as an analysis by The New York Times of FEMA data shows, or that in many cases flood insurance covered only a fraction of the losses. According to the analysis by The Times, in the areas in and around New York City that were hit hardest by the storm, almost half of the people who received assistance from FEMA got less than $5,000. Most of that money was intended to cover housing and other emergency costs immediately after the storm. Hurricane Sandy was a storm like no other in the history of New York. It left more than 100 people dead and caused enormous structural damage that will take years to repair. FEMA has received claims for nearly 16 million square feet of drywall, 56,000 furnaces and water heaters and enough paint to cover 43 million square feet. But the most the agency gave in “individual assistance” to any single homeowner was about $36,000. The agency’s representatives instructed homeowners to file claims on their flood insurance policies, if they had one, and to apply for loans from the Small Business Administration, if they qualified. But as those first, small installments ran out, the frustration of negotiating with insurers added to the stress of being displaced. Photo LONG-TERM TEMPORARY Since the storm, Conni Freestone and her boyfriend, David Fagan, have been living in a rental in Toms River, N.J.Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times “I think flood insurance underpayments is the single biggest reason for why the rebuilding hasn’t really taken off,” said Benjamin R. Rajotte, director of the Disaster Relief Clinic at the Touro Law Center in Central Islip, N.Y. “Frequently, people are coming in saying they received half or less of what it would take to rebuild their house, not even to raise them up but just to rebuild.” Officials at FEMA, which oversees the national flood insurance program, said that adjusters had incentive to cover all eligible losses, but that some policyholders might be disappointed at receiving money for what things were worth, rather than what it would cost to replace them. Those with complaints may appeal the decisions. Many residents of the region were also surprised to have claims denied for damage to the foundations of their houses because the damage was deemed to have resulted from “earth movement,” not storm flooding. Some of those displaced, like Rochelle Grubb of Far Rockaway, Queens, had no insurance at all against a flood. Ms. Grubb, 41, a special-needs teacher at Public School 256 in Queens, had allowed her flood insurance to lapse before her house on Beach 101st Street was inundated by the fast-rising water. In early December, she said she had been tutoring and her husband, Timothy, had been working overtime to come up with the $270,000 they estimated it would cost them to rebuild. They said they expected it would be more than a year before they could return to their house, but they do have flood insurance now. Ms. Grubb said she had to buy it to qualify for a $135,000 loan she received from the Small Business Administration. “It’s 101 Street but we all called it One Hundred and Fun Street,” she said, referring to her close-knit neighbors. “Now when we see each other, we’d just hug and cry. And we’re like, when, when, when?” ‘Too Much Red Tape’ FEMA officials say that their primary goal is to provide emergency aid in the days and weeks after a disaster strikes — the first splash of what is known in Washington as the cascade of federal assistance. The process of obtaining full compensation for losses is designed to involve several steps and to frustrate efforts to take unfair advantage, as some were accused of doing after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, government officials say. Standing beside Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in Manhattan in late October, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that more care was being taken to minimize fraud. “We’re not just sending checks willy-nilly,” he said. The biggest chunks of federal aid for residents come not from FEMA but from HUD, which received $16 billion from Congress to dole out in grants to state and local agencies. That money was part of a total federal allocation of about $60 billion in recovery money. So far, New York City and the States of New York and New Jersey have received more than $10.2 billion of that money. But they have handed out only a small fraction of it. By the anniversary of the storm on Oct. 29, New Jersey had spent about $230 million of its grants, but New York City and New York State had made very few payments through their rebuilding programs, known as Build it Back in the city and New York Rising on Long Island. Photo AN EMPTY LOT Rochelle and Timothy Grubb, whose Queens home was demolished after the storm, estimate that rebuilding will cost $270,000.Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Robert Smith, 64, a retired New York Police Department detective, said he had nearly given up hope on receiving enough money to rebuild the cottage he shared with his wife in the Broad Channel section of Queens. “FEMA has been totally insensitive to what I consider our basic needs,” said Mr. Smith, who has been living with his wife in their cabin upstate. As for the Build It Back program, he said he had talked to dozens of homeowners in Broad Channel and none had received any money from that program. “It’s close to 15 months later and the only thing we’re getting is a bureaucracy and promises,” Mr. Smith said. “I want nothing more than to go back to live in Queens, or buy me out.” Caswell F. Holloway IV, the deputy mayor overseeing Build It Back, said city officials waited until HUD had made its second allocation to the program before telling applicants how much they might receive.

The state’s New York Rising program kicked into high gear this October, sending out 4,200 letters that promised $450 million to homeowners and families on Long Island. A second mass-mailing, in November, promised payments to an additional 350 recipients. In late October, the announcement of the latest portion of federal money spurred Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York to declare that “the aid spigot is now open, money will be flowing.” He conceded that “in Year 1, we all agree, the aid flowed too slowly” and said that there was “too much red tape.” Only a few of those payments have been made so far, but state officials said on Friday that they had asked HUD to allow them to send more than $650 million directly to 6,666 homeowners before the end of the year. Garrett J. Kaiser, a heavy equipment operator who lives with his wife and two children in Patchogue on Long Island, became one of the first beneficiaries of the state’s program this week. Mr. Kaiser, 37, and his family lived for months in a camping trailer in their next-door neighbors’ driveway after the nearby bay rose up and filled their single-level house with two feet of water. After the storm, he set about tearing out the soaked Sheetrock almost immediately, then had the structure raised seven feet. He personally rebuilt much of it, dipping into his family’s savings before he started receiving installments of insurance proceeds that totaled $115,000. In late October, he was one of the first applicants to the New York Rising program to sign the final paperwork to close a deal. The promised payment of $38,000 would cover all of the expenses that FEMA and flood insurance did not, he said last month. He added that he had heard of people receiving promises of as much as $250,000 from New York Rising and that everyone he knew who had applied to the program was satisfied. “Now I feel blessed that the storm hit because I have a wonderful new home,” said Mr. Kaiser, who has gone into business elevating other homes in flood-prone areas. “I’m staying forever.” On Wednesday evening, Mr. Kaiser had not yet received any money from New York Rising. But after an inquiry from a reporter about the delay, Mr. Kaiser said the full $38,000 was deposited in his account on Thursday. An Uneven Recovery Conni Freestone and her boyfriend, David Fagan, have been sleeping on air mattresses in a rented bungalow they have shared with Ms. Freestone’s ailing, 63-year-old mother in Toms River, N.J. They had been living in her mother’s home in nearby Point Pleasant when the hurricane drove water from a creek into the garage and main floor of the two-story house. The flood ruined most of the instruments used by Mr. Fagan’s band and the equipment Ms. Freestone used as a freelance photographer. But the flood insurance on the house did not cover those contents. Photo AT HOME, BUT IN DEBT Penny Ryan, left, and Anne Walsh said they spent about $200,000 to restore their home in Long Beach, N.Y.Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Ms. Freestone had been frustrated by the slow response of FEMA to their many appeals for help and found out only after pestering Gov. Chris Christie in public that the agency had estimated the damage to the house at less than $7,000. (An aide to Mr. Christie investigated and discovered the low estimate.) That sum amounted to a fraction of the $83,000 a local contractor said the repairs would cost. The family had been paying for his work out of equity withdrawn from the house, which was their main asset. Much of that work, including electrical wiring, proved shoddy, Ms. Freestone said, and the family was afraid to move back in. With mold climbing the new drywall, they decided to sue the first contractor and find another. But they had received just $55,000 from their insurance policies, so they kept asking for more help as the anniversary of the storm came and went. “I felt like I was begging,” Ms. Freestone said of her frequent appeals to FEMA and state agencies. “When I did suck it up and begged, I got shot down. I’m used to being the volunteer, not the one asking for help.” The disparities in recovery from Hurricane Sandy are on stark display in Long Beach, N.Y., on the block of modest homes where Ms. Fitzgerald and Megan lived next door to a couple, Anne Walsh and Penny Ryan. Their two-story houses, which stood side by side on lots of just 1,800 square feet, suffered similar damage when the floodwaters rose above their floorboards. But Long Beach officials did not declare Ms. Walsh and Ms. Ryan’s house to be “substantially damaged.” And that determination has made all the difference. Unlike Ms. Fitzgerald, they were cleared to fix up their home without having to elevate it off the ground. So now Ms. Walsh and Ms. Ryan return from work in New York City to a pin-neat living room with a gleaming floor made of Brazilian teak. Within weeks after the waters receded, Ms. Walsh, a nurse, and Ms. Ryan, a public school principal, had dipped into their savings to pay a contractor to start tearing out and replace the ruined floors and walls. All told, they said, they had spent about $200,000 to restore their home — considerably more than they recouped through FEMA, flood insurance and a $26,000 grant from New York Rising. “We went from having a comfortable lifestyle to being totally in debt,” said Ms. Ryan, 50. Ms. Walsh said she thought it would take five years for the neighborhood they cherished to come fully back to life. Some houses still sit dark and boarded up, others are being raised several feet to avoid another flooding. Ms. Fitzgerald had held out hope that the New York Rising program would come through with a grant big enough to bridge the wide gap between what she received from her insurance companies and what it would cost to build a house from scratch so close to New York City. When she finally got her answer from New York Rising, Ms. Fitzgerald said she was “wrecked” by “bitter disappointment.” The state had calculated that her house could be rebuilt for $160,000, so they subtracted the $84,000 they say she had received from other sources since the storm and awarded her $76,000. She said that she thought it would cost closer to $250,000 to rebuild. And she has already spent some of her insurance proceeds to pay for demolition and plans and permits for a new house, leaving her with far less than what she needs to rebuild. “I’m not looking for anything fabulous,” Ms. Fitzgerald said, choking back the frustration of not knowing if she and her daughter would ever get back to Delaware Avenue. “I love that block,” she said. “I want to build back.” Julie Turkewitz contributed reporting.

31 photos that show the destruction of Hurricane Sandy 5 years ago A woman in New Dorp Beach, Staten Island, weeps after learning that her neighbor is OK. Lucas Jackson/Reuters Five years ago, Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast with a record-setting 14-foot surge. Winds gusted up to 80 mph, and tides were especially high due to the full moon. It wreaked havoc on the shores of the Northeast, killing at least 100 people. When Sandy made landfall in Atlantic City on the night of October 29, 2012, the streets were flooded, power lines and trees were knocked down, and the city's iconic boardwalk was destroyed. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced a weeklong commemoration this Monday, along with the news that the three most affected counties are now financially "fully recovered." Christie also noted that the news "doesn't mean that every family is back in their home ... we're now at about 1,000 homes that are still left." Local grassroots organizations are disputing Christie's numbers, claiming that it's closer to 2,300 homes. Here, on the fifth anniversary, we take a look back at the destruction the dangerous storm caused on the coasts of New York and New Jersey. 1/ Thousands of New Jersey residents were asked to evacuate their homes, and casinos were closed in Atlantic City.

What You Need to Know about Hurricane Sandy to Get Ready Take a hurricane moving up from the south. Mash in a colder storm moving in from the west. Add a ridge of high pressure extending through the atmosphere above the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and Greenland, blocking the typical flow of the jet stream. That's the recipe for what will become "Post-Tropical Storm Sandy" or, as it has more colloquially been dubbed: "Frankenstorm." The result of all that atmospheric blocking is that instead of turning away from land and heading out into the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, this particular storm is going to be pushed ashore somewhere between Delaware and Long Island, New York. At the same time, it will be merging with the cold air coming in from the west—and that means Sandy will be the unusual hurricane that ends up producing snow in its western reaches. And what a reach. Sandy's swirling circulation and high winds will reach from Ohio and the Great Lakes region all the way to the New England Coast and down into the Carolinas. "A large number of folks over a very large area, many states, are going to experience a significant wind event, strong tropical force winds to perhaps hurricane winds," warns James Franklin, the branch chief of NOAA's National Hurricane Center on a conference call with reporters. The high winds increase the chances of downed trees and power lines; several days of ground-softening rain are likely to increase the risk. As much as 10 inches of rain may fall to the east of wherever the center of the storm comes ashore, and NOAA is currently predicting as much as two feet of snow for the mountains of West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The unusual combination of rain and snow are not likely to hit until early next week. NOAA is currently predicting landfall by Monday night, which is bad timing for storm surges; the full moon is on October 29 so high tides will be even higher than other times of the month. The high pressure off to the east means the storm will land directly perpendicular to the coast, rather than delivering a more typical glancing blow the way Hurricane Irene last year. It's possible a city like New York could see storm surges of as much as 10 feet. Plus, Sandy is a huge, lumbering beast of a storm, likely to linger for two or even three days. That means much like the "Perfect Storm" of 1991 the danger is not just coastal flooding, but also inland flooding as the system dumps rain on creeks, streams and rivers. It remains to be seen what, if anything, Sandy will do, and where. It has the chance to be the storm that comes ashore with the lowest pressure ever recorded, a sign of strength that will spread strong winds across the whole post-tropical storm. It is a testimony to the computer modeling capacity of government weather forecasters as well as the eyes in the sky that can track such storm that warnings of this storm are appearing almost a full week before it hits. (Mind you, these satellites are nearing the end of their useful lifespan and budget woes are delaying their replacement.) With the storm still three or more days away from landfall, the margin of error for NOAA's track forecast is as much as 200 miles, or just a little bit less than the distance between Washington, D.C. and New York City. But it is already clear according to Craig Fugate, the administrator of FEMA, that "it is going to be a challenging storm because it is going to continue to grow in size and the impacts are going to be very widespread and go well inland." In other words, batten down the hatches, get your supplies in order and be ready for technology failures, whether electricity outages or a loss of cellphone service. Oh and, as Franklin adds: "After Sandy has come and gone, we'll still have another whole month of hurricane season to go. This may well not be the last system we deal with this year."

How Much Will Hurricane Sandy Cost Insurance Companies? Just days after Hurricane Sandy pummelled the east coast of the United States, and made her historic turn inward towards the New Jersey coast, insurance estimates began rolling in, and the news wasn't good. The storm, which affected a broad area, particularly devastated the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. Many in the tri-state area and beyond suffered severe or moderate property damage, flooding, power outages and more. Now that the clean-up for Hurricane Sandy has begun, insurance companies are attempting to gauge just how expensive this catastrophic storm really was and what the real cost of this natural disaster looks like. Here is a look at preliminary figures from the damage Hurricane Sandy caused and an in-depth look at just how much money the superstorm is costing insurance companies as a result. Total Estimated Cost of Damage is StaggeringThe total estimated cost of damage wreaked by Hurricane Sandy is nothing short of staggering. An article released by the Associated Press on Nov. 2, 2012, estimates the total damage caused by Hurricane Sandy to be up to $50 billion. (The total was projected by Eqecat, a catastrophic risk management consulting firm, which indicated that the damage caused by the storm was between $30-$50 billion.) The damage is comprised of property damage, loss of business, an increase in living expenses and more. Cost to Insurance Companies Projected to Be Much LessAnother finding in Eqecat's report is that although the total amount of damage is estimated at $50 billion, the costs that insurance companies will incur from Hurricane Sandy are considerably less. The report indicated that insurance companies can expect to pay between $10-$20 billion. The low end of this figure, while significantly reduced from that of the total damage incurred, is still a hefty price tag to pay. Hurricane Sandy is already more expensive than many severe hurricanes from the past, including 2008's Hurricane Ike, 2004's Hurricane Ivan and even the much overhyped Hurricane Irene from 2011. Why the Lower Price Tag for Insurance Companies?There are plenty of reasons why the insurance companies got a lower price tag. For one, many homeowners' insurance policies have tricks and do not cover the cost incurred from flooding. In order for flood claims to be paid, a consumer must have already purchased a flood policy prior to the arrival of Hurricane Sandy. In addition, the damage estimates include costs that are not covered by insurance policies such as loss of wages, power outages and increased costs of living expenses. High Short-Term Costs, Low Long-Term EffectWhile the staggering cost of Hurricane Sandy is still being calculated, insurance companies and risk management firms are trying to pinpoint whether the damage done is short-term or if it has the potential to cripple the economy and insurance industry on a long term or permanent level. According to an article released by the Huffington Post on Oct. 31, 2012, the rebuilding will start and continue at a feverish pace, and the economy will not be impacted over a long period of time. Meanwhile, an article released by SeekingAlpha.com projects that the insurance industry will take a hit, but quickly recover once the cleanup has been completed. The Bottom LineHurricane Sandy ravaged the east coast and left New Jersey coastal towns, New York City and plenty of other locations with billions of dollars worth of damages. With cases of flooding, structural damage, power outages and more, the clean-up process for Sandy is certain to be long and expensive. Only time will tell if the numbers projected by Eqecat are correct, and as more reports of damage come through, it certainly seems as though the catastrophic risk management firm has done its homework. Let Sandy serve as a great reminder of how families should take appropriate measures for protecting their assets and finances from natural disasters.

Read More Hurricane Sandy: Coverage of the Storm and its Aftermath Published: October 1st, 2013 By Climate Central Ben Strauss on CNN with Anderson Cooper Ben Strauss on NBC Nightly News Superstorm Sandy — part hurricane, part fearsome nor’easter, the result of a bizarre confluence of events — battered the Eastern U.S. in October 2012. The storm brought a record storm surge to New York City and the New Jersey Shore, severely damaging coastal communities and shutting down mass transit throughout the New York metropolitan area. In addition, it caused 159 fatalities and caused an estimated $65 billion in damage according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The aftermath drove home the vulnerability of coastal cities like New York to sea level rise and storm surge. It also sparked a national conversation about how to better prepare the U.S. for extreme weather and climate events, some of which are becoming more frequent and severe as a result of the warming climate. Climate Central is chronicling the science of Sandy and the discussion it started. View our archive of past and present coverage:
Tidal gauge at The Battery showing the storm surge (green) lining up perfectly with the high tide (blue) to produce a massive storm tide (red) – National Data Buoy Center, NOAA. Also note that pressure bottomed out just above 960mb. A site at Sandy Hook, NJ stopped reporting before the peak storm surge/tide. Heavy rain combined with the storm tide on the Chesapeake and Delaware bays caused flooding in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The storm tide travelled up the Hudson river leading to record levels at Poughkeepsie. Rivers are still rising in response to the heavy rains from the storm still flowing into them. Heavy snow and (near) blizzard conditions are occurring the central Appalachian mountains and Ohio. Storm conditions are still occurring on the Great Lakes leading to very rough lake conditions and coastal flooding where onshore winds are producing 1-3ft water level rises. Damages from this hurricane will likely be astronomical in expense, mainly from the coastal flooding and power outages. In these coastal areas, many trees still had their leaves and so tree damage, power outages, and damage to homes from falling trees was the primary form of wind damage. Tree damage, power line damage, and roof damage from the weight of the snow, which was of a high water content, were the most common form of damage where feet of snow have fallen in the mountains. Meteorologically, this storm was significant because of its rare form of interaction with an extra-tropical system, its trajectory, its record breaking low landfall pressure of 946mb, and its size. A storm like this has immense potential to cause death and destruction and that it has indeed lived up to its potential. The name Sandy will likely be retired. Sandy’s forecast track has changed little over the last day. The hurricane is expected to continue northeast or north-northeastwards today. A turn to the north should commence this evening or tonight, and a turn to the northwest tomorrow morning. Landfall is expected in New Jersey Monday night. Further deepening of this system has occurred with pressures falling to 951mb. Sandy could either hold its own, or continue to deepen up until landfall. Impacts:Heavy Rain – Widespread areas of 3-8″ of rain with localized areas of >12″ of rain are likely along and to the left of this storm’s track as Sandy moves inland. This could lead to moderate-major river flooding in the Mid-Atlantic states. Near-coastal river flooding may be exacerbated by elevated tides. High Wind – Tropical Storm conditions have been reported in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and gusts over tropical storm force have been reported in Virginia. Damaging winds to hurricane force are expected to occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland to near coastal cities. Tropical Storm force/gale force winds (>39mph) are expected to occur well inland with damaging gusts over 50mph common. This could cause severe tree damage or defoliation and lead to power outages or even structural damage as far inland as southern Ontario and Quebec. Storm Surge – A storm surge of 2-5ft is occurring along the North Carolina, Virginia, and Delmarva coasts, this could increase further as Hurricane Sandy continues an onshore flow in this area. Sound-side flooding is likely also occurring in Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. In Long Island sound and in New York Harbor, expect peak storm surges of 6-11ft. Anywhere else with onshore gale force winds can expect storm surges between 4 and 8ft. These are very serious heights above mean tide level and if combined with a high tide cycle, could produce disastrous coastal flooding and damage in a highly populated area. This storm surge will be accompanied by large battering waves that could produce erosion and additional structural damage. Records for storm surge values in this region could be threatened and the infrastructure in place put to the test. On the Great Lakes, the prospect of lake length winds on Lake Michigan have prompted lake shore flood watches to be posted in Illinois and Indiana. High surf and onshore gale force winds there could cause localized lake shore flooding there, a similar threat exists for Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Heavy Snow – In the middle Appalachians in West Virginia, a combination of tropical moisture, up sloping winds, and cold air filtering in on the west side of Sandy will mix to dump heavy wet snow and bring gusty winds. Near blizzard conditions are possible here and winter storm watches are in effect calling for 1-2 feet of snow in the highest elevations above 3000feet in altitude. 2-6″ are possible below 2000feet in altitude in West Virginia. In areas where deciduous trees still have leaves, the combination of snow and winds will produce significant tree damage that could lead to power outages, the weight of the snow may even lead to some roof damage.

Bermuda: Bands of showers are expected to move through tonight and tomorrow. Squally showers in these bands could contain tropical storm force winds and tornadic activity is a distinct threat here. The Bermuda Weather Service expects 35-40mph southwesterly winds with gusts to 65mph late tonight – but this could be confined to the western marine area. Elevated surf along the south shore will produce dangerous rip currents and significant beach erosion, while making it hazardous to be out on the water. Why no tropical storm/hurricane warnings for the Northeast/New England? Hurricane Sandy could transition into a post-tropical storm as it approaches. If the storm is no longer tropical, tropical storm and hurricane warnings cannot be in effect for it. In the event this happens, all warnings would have to be switched to those used for mid-latitude extra-tropical storms which could lead to confusion among the public. So to avoid confusion, they are starting warnings off as those for extra-tropical storms.
Tag: sandy snow East Coast view of Hurricane Sandy, GOES Imagery from NOAA. October 27th 2012. Sandy has become so large that typical floater imagery doesn’t capture the entire storm. As of 11am eastern from the National Hurricane Center: Maximum sustained winds are near 75mph Minimum central pressure is near 958mb Sandy is moving North-Northeast at about 9mph. Sandy is doing a balancing act north of the Bahamas where it is trying to deepen (lower its central pressure) and expand its wind field at the same time. Fluctuations in its maximum wind speeds have been the result, and Sandy will likely continue to be at borderline hurricane status until Sunday night when it will try to strengthen as it gets energized by its merger with the trough over the interior Eastern United States. Hurricane Sandy’s pressure fell from 969mb at 11pm last night to 958mb at 11am this morning indicating deepening. While its maximum radius of tropical storm force winds expanded from 275miles at 5pm yesterday, to 450miles at 5am this morning. All Hurricane Warnings have been discontinued for now, but tropical storm conditions are still occurring in the northernmost Bahamas, offshore of Florida and North and South Carolina where tropical storm warnings are in effect. Further advisories, watches, and warnings will be needed as Sandy approaches, potentially from North Carolina to Maine. East coast states have already declared states of emergency and some evacuation notices have been posted in advance of Sandy’s landfall which is forecast to be somewhere in New Jersey or the Delmarva peninsula. Official National Hurricane Center track for Hurricane Sandy as of 11am Eastern Time. Tropical Storm Warnings for parts of North and South Carolina and the Bahamas in blue, and Tropical Storm Watches in yellow for parts of South Carolina and Bermuda. Impacts…Heavy flooding rain over 6″ in areas is likely near the storm’s path. Areas where both storm surge and flooding rains are a threat may have the flooding exacerbated by the unusually high tides down stream. Heavy wet snow is a distinct possibility in the higher elevations of Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Significant coastal flooding is also likely in areas of onshore winds and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where storm surges are forecast to reach up to 8feet and storm tides may be extreme due to the large changes between low and high tide and the astronomical high tide with the full moon on Monday. Damaging winds (30-60mph) could extend far inland causing tree damage and potentially some power outages. Structurally damaging winds (50-75mph) could occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland. Keep in mind that tropical storm force winds (sustained at >39mph) have been observed more than 400miles from the center of this storm – so even though the storm may make landfall in New Jersey, areas as far north as Maine and as far inland as Ontario and Quebec (including Lakes Erie and Ontario) could see tropical storm conditions. Areas to the south will have offshore winds, and tropical storm force winds will extend less far from the center and will be gustier in nature. In these areas, hazardously low water levels may be observed, especially at low tide. Meanwhile, there could be a period of tropical storm conditions in Bermuda (Tropical Storm Watch) sometime between tonight and Monday night as Sandy continues to expand and passes to the distant west. Squally showers will be the theme here during that period.
Sandy, with 85 mph winds, barrels down towards New York City Firefighters respond to a building facade collapse on 8th Avenue after high winds hit NYC. (Bryan Smith for New York Daily News) Tropical storm Sandy churned towards an anxiously quiet New York City on Monday, bringing 85 mph winds and storm surges that could lash 50 million people along the East Coast. "The worst is still coming," Gov. Cuomo warned, hours before he ordered the closure of the Whitestone Bridge, the Throgs Neck Bridge, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, the Henry Hudson Bridge, the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge at 7 p.m. Advertisement The Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge and Queensboro Bridge were also to be closed to traffic at 7 p.m. The Tappan Zee Bridge was shut down at 4 p.m. under an earlier order. Cuomo's words rang true with the collapse of a crane on top of a 90-story skyscraper on W. 57th St. near Seventh Ave. in Manhattan. It dangled precariously in the high winds as the few pedestrians out on the streets ran for cover below. As of 7 p.m., the massive storm had been downgraded from a hurricane just off of Cape May, N.J. It was moving at 28 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. As electricity in lower Manhattan was cut, Mayor Bloomberg said it was time for New Yorkers to wait out the storm. "We're already seeing significant impacts from the storm and the worst of it is about to hit," Mayor Bloomberg said. "If you're in your home or somewhere safe where you can remain, stay there. The time for evacuation and relocation is over." It was expected to make landfall just south of Atlantic City, and the biggest storm surge was supposed to hit the city around 8 p.m. The violent squall has been dubbed "Frankenstorm" because it's expected to combine with a storm system from the west and cold air from Canada — unleashing rain, snow, and high winds.

"Unfortunately, this sort of storm is the worst-case scenario for our region," said Sean Potter, a National Weather Service spokesman. Public transportation across the city was shut down, and the city said schools would stay closed for a second day Tuesday. Con Edison customers south of 34th Street in Manhattan received robo calls warning that the company might preemptively cut power to prevent damage to electrical equipment. The flood-prone Holland and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels were shut by 2 p.m. The FDR Drive from the Battery to 155th Street was closed after water crashed over the seawall, and there was no traffic on the Bronx River Parkway. Advertisement City officials said they could shut East River bridges if winds get too high. The Lincoln and Queens-Midtown tunnels, as well as the RFK Bridge would remain open, but Cuomo cautioned that could change. "They will be open for now," he said. "They can close on very short notice." Evacuation orders remained in effect for 375,000 people in low-lying areas as officials braced for historic flooding if the storm does hit at high tide. "There is going to be a lot of rain and there's going to be a lot of wind. The question is the extent of the storm surge," Cuomo said. A crane dangles above 57th Street and 7th Avenue. (ABC) "Do not underestimate this storm ... They are talking about surges we have not seen before," he added, insisting the state had done all it could to prepare. President Obama, who called off campaigning and headed back to the White House, made a last-ditch call for people to heed evacuation orders. "Do not delay. Don't pause. Don't question the instructions that are being given, because this is a serious storm and it could potentially have fatal consequence if people haven't acted quickly," he said. Mayor Bloomberg said the crisis would last at least a day. "Water levels along our coast and in out waterways have begun rising and are expected to remain at higher-than-normal levels for the next 24 hours," he said. Most New Yorkers had already stocked up on supplies and hunkered down — leaving many streets eerily empty long before any major weather had arrived. Procrastinators who woke up to reports that Sandy had strengthened overnight and was still on track to hit the city rushed out to make last-minute preparations. "I should have done this last night but I kept thinking it was all going to blow over," said Rosa Castro, 48, buying water and cat food at a bodega in Bath Beach, Brooklyn. "But now I'm scared. To be honest with you, I'm real freaked out." By the early evening some 150,000 Con Edison customers were already without electricity, according to a spokeswoman for the utility. The most affected boroughs were Staten Island and Queens, as well as Westchester. A woman takes a photo at 98th street on the boardwalk at Rockaway beach. (SHANNON STAPLETON/Reuters/Shannon Stapleton) And more than 100,000 electric users in Long Island had power failures. In Brooklyn, trees were falling. A woman has rushed to Bellevue Hospital with a head injury after being hit buy one in Greenpoint. She was treated and released. Another tree smashed into a garage on Colonial Rd., and one smashed into a house on Bay Ridge Pkwy. "I heard a big crashing boom. It sounded like an explosion. It was pretty freaky," said Justin D'Amico, 42, whose home was hit. "I opened the door and everything was crashing on me. It was terrifying." The first signs of flooding could be seen by 9 a.m. Much of the Belt Parkway near Bay Parkway in Brooklyn was under several feet of water at 9 a.m. In Red Hook, Brooklyn, water was lapping over the sidewalk and up to storefronts. "This could be the storm of a lifetime," said Javier Priegue, 37, who rode his bike from downtown Brooklyn to take a look. "I think it's probably a good idea to get out of here in the next few hours." "I opened the door and everything was crashing on me. It was terrifying." Much of the Belt Parkway near Bay Parkway exit in Brooklyn was under several feet of water at 9 a.m. In Red Hook, Brooklyn, water was lapping over the sidewalk and up to storefront. "This could be the storm of a lifetime," said Javier Priegue, 37, who rode his bike from downtown Brooklyn to take a look. "I think it's probably a good idea to get out of here in the next few hours." As of 11 a.m., the storm surge was already higher than Hurricane Irene was last year at the same stage of the storm. And some forecast models showed Sandy's surges topping out at 11 feet — even higher than Hurricane Donna in 1960, which left a river running through lower Manhattan. High-wind warnings for the five boroughs went into effect at 6 a.m. Monday and continue through 6 p.m. Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a coastal flood warning from 6 a.m. on Monday to 3 p.m. on Tuesday. City and state officials urged everyone to stay inside. Not everyone heeded the order.

I just don't buy the hype." The scene from the Verrazano-Narrows at 69th street pier before the arrival of Hurricane Sandy in Bay Ridge. (Joe Marino/for New York Daily News) The suburbs were also feeling Sandy's punch. More than 5,000 homes in New Jersey were without power, and more blackouts were expected as downed trees fell power lines. In Freeport, L.I., many streets were three feet underwater at 10 a.m. David Anderson, 64, floated down his street in a kayak along with his 8-month-old chocolate lab Sadie Potaty. "I'm going to the store to get some beers," he said. Freeport firefighters ran through two feet of water to reach a burning home on Branch Ave. and struggled to hook up to a fire hydrant. "I called 911 but I couldn't get through," said witness Greg Watson. Further south, reports of damage gave dramatic hints of Sandy's fury. A pier in Ocean City, Md., was badly damaged. Off North Carolina, a replica of the HMS Bounty took on water and began to sink as the Coast Guard mounted a helicopter rescue of the lifeboat-bound crew. Hurricane Irene battered the city for 12 hours last year, but Sandy is expected to pummel the area relentlessly for 24 to 36 hours, forecasters said. Mass transit was not expected to resume before Wednesday. Nearly 10,000 flights had been canceled for Monday and Tuesday. The New York Stock Exchange, closed for floor trading Monday, will also be shuttered Tuesday.

(LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS) A few thousand people were holed up in city evacuation centers, but it was unclear how many people in Zone A just ignored orders to get out. The city shut off hot water and electric power at public housing developments in the evacuation zone to prod people into 76 shelters for storm refugees and their pets. Police made one storm-related arrest — slapping the handcuffs on a man who refused to leave the Times Square subway station after the transit shutdown. "A number of people were required to leave," said Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne, the NYPD's top spokesman. "One person fought with police." As always, some city daredevils refused to play it safe. Jack Green, 36, who lives in the Hammel Houses in Rockaway Beach, refused to leave even though he had no elevator service. "I've lived out here all my life. Why should we be running now?" he said. "I believe God's going to take care of all of us. He's going to protect the 'hood." On Coney Island, Eric Doviak, 37, of Midwood, took a dip in the choppy waters of Coney Island.

Sandy is forecast to move north-northeastward over the next few days. As it moves into the Bahamas, strong onshore winds for the Florida coastline, with gusts to 50 mph and higher along the coast are expected. Even though direct impacts are not anticipated across interior Central Florida, these strong onshore winds will cause dangerous boating and surf conditions, along with major beach erosion and extremely dangerous surf conditions, including strong rip currents. By the weekend, Sandy will be moving well away from the coastline, as our next cold front moves into the area. Drier and less windy conditions return at this time. Elsewhere in the Atlantic Basin, Tony was downgraded in the open Atlantic. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Interests elsewhere along the East Coast of the United States should monitor the progress of Sandy. Discussion and 48-hour Outlook At 2 a.m. EDT, the center of Hurricane Sandy was located near latitude 25.8 north, longitude 76.5 west. Sandy is now moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph. A turn toward the northwest and a decrease in forward speed are expected overnight and Friday, followed by a turn back toward the north and northeast Friday night and Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Sandy will continue moving near or over the northwestern Bahamas overnight and Friday. Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter Aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph with higher gusts. Sandy is a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Some additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Sandy is expected to remain a hurricane for the next couple of days. Hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center, and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 275 miles. Sandy is expected to grow in size during the next couple of days. A NOAA Automated Station at Settlement Point on grand Bahama Island recently reported a 2-minute wind of 45 mph, and a wind gust of 56 mph. The latest minimum central pressure based on data from the aircraft data is 968 mb, or 28.58 inches. Hazards Affecting Land Wind: Hurricane conditions will continue spreading across the northwestern Bahamas overnight and Friday. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward in the warning area along the East Coast of Florida overnight through Friday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area Friday through Saturday. Rainfall: Sandy is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches across Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches possible. These rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and mud slides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected over portions of the Bahamas, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches possible. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are possible across the Florida Keys into southeast and east-central Florida, with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches possible. Storm surge: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. The water could reach the following depths above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. Water levels will begin to subside in Cuba and Jamaica this afternoon. Post-Tropical Cyclone Tony Advisory At 5 p.m., the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Tony was located near latitude 31.2 north, longitude 34.0 west. Tony is moving toward the east-northeast near 22 mph. Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph with higher gusts. Gradual weakening should occur during the next day or so. Post-Tropical Cyclone Tony should be absorbed by a larger low pressure system over the northeastern Atlantic on Saturday. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles from the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb or 29.56 inches. Hazards Affecting Land None. Next Advisory Complete advisory: This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on Tony.
disaster Hurricane Sandy Overview Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. Sandy was the deadliest hurricane to hit the Northeast in 40 years, and damage estimates have placed the cost at upwards of $68 billion. Only Hurricane Katrina cost more. Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic from Haiti and Jamaica and north into Canada. More than 200 deaths were attributed to the storm, with 146 of those in the United States and 98 in the Caribbean. NGOs remain on the ground helping people to rebuild their lives and local and federal jurisdictions are working to rebuild — and affect policy changes — to prevent such devastation from bring repeated. About $60.4 billion in federal aid has been provided to storm-affected areas. Background The 10th named storm of the 2012 hurricane season, Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic, with deaths extending from Haiti and Jamaica to Canada. While still out in the ocean, it affected North Carolina coastal areas, causing storm surges and flooding on barrier islands. As the storm came ashore in New Jersey, it was so massive that the effects were felt as far south as the mountains of Tennessee and West Virginia, and as far west as Lake Michigan. More than 200 deaths have since been attributed to the storm, with most of those in the United States. Sandy raised key questions about building in coastal areas, along with concerns and discussion about future storms. New York officials revived talk of a storm surge barrier to protect the city. The storm also recharged the issue of those who refuse mandatory evacuation orders, choosing to shelter in place instead. Hurricane Irene, which struck essentially the same area in 2011 without causing as much damage as feared, only complicated the issue of evacuation “need.” In Haiti, where residents continue to struggle to rebuild from the 2010 earthquake, the floods that followed the hurricane severely affected food security. The United Nations anticipates more than 1.5 million people at risk of food insecurity in 2013 due to the damage caused by Sandy. Cholera, which had broken out post-earthquake, was a continuing concern. In Cuba, news of the devastation was slow to arrive, though 20 percent of the population was affected. It took a full two weeks for the first aid to arrive, a 40-ton shipment from the United Nations. Another 40 tons quickly followed. U.S. Impact The hurricane made landfall in New York and New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, colliding with winter weather systems already present and creating a “perfect storm.” Widespread impact included destructive winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge flooding, and even heavy, wet snow. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide. At the height of the storm, more than 7.5 million people were without power. Power outages continued for weeks after the hurricane made landfall, yet many residents remained in their homes. In New England, Hurricane Sandy was complicated when a Nor’Easter blew in a few days later, bringing another blast of cold air and high storm surges to the area. West Virginia and Tennessee received nearly three feet of snow as a result of the storm. CDP Insights Insights from Dr. Irwin Redlener on Lessons from Hurricane Sandy: Dr. Irwin Redlener, Director, National Center for Disaster Preparedness, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University and Co-Chair, NYS Ready Commission and Center for Disaster Philanthropy Advisory Council Member outlines lessons in five key areas: evacuations, citizen preparedness, vulnerable populations, incident command and coordination, mental health, training, and recovery. Read his full analysis provided to Philanthropy New York. Insights from the CDP Advisory Council on Hurricane Sandy: While thousands of NGOs and volunteers rushed to offer much-needed immediate relief to communities and people impacted by Hurricane Sandy, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy estimated it would take years to fully rebuild communities in the United States and even longer in the Caribbean. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Advisory Council — experts from academia, the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors — offer their insights on long-term recovery needs and opportunities for donors. Donors While immediate relief dollars went to housing, food and clothing, the CDP Hurricane Sandy Disaster Fund was established to invest in long-term projects that fill gaps where public resources are unavailable or scarce. We requested grant applications from NGOs committed to projects that cross broad disciplines to ease the transition from disaster to normalcy; foster collaboration among donors; use existing local philanthropic networks and a work to strengthen local philanthropy; promote cross-sector coordination with academics, donors, think tanks, and public and private humanitarian actors; and support innovative research that informs policy and strengthens future disaster preparation and response. NGO Response AidMatrix worked to get the needs of impacted communities captured and listed on The National Donations Management Network. All Hands had two superstorm Sandy response efforts: Project Staten Island and Project Long Island. They housed staff and team leaders within the impacted areas, and coordinated efforts of volunteers to aid residents by removing debris (mucking) and removing affected walls/floors (gutting. American Red Cross worked both immediately and long-term to help those affected by the storm. Red Cross workers met with families to get them financial assistance to help with security and utility deposits, home repairs and rent, as well as link them to available social service programs. In addition, the Red Cross gave grants to a number of nonprofits working in New Jersey and New York to help people with home repairs, mold remediation, food and financial assistance, and to support the work of community. AmeriCares provided more than $6.5 million in aid, benefiting more than 450,000 people, including $3.5 million in medicines and relief supplies to hard-hit communities. AmeriCares also provided $3.0 million in funding to organizations ASPCA staff and responders provided immediate relief to families affected by flooding and power outages. Responders delivered supplies, crates and food to evacuation centers, where hundreds of animals were housed, in the five boroughs. After the storm, the ASPCA worked to ensure that animal shelters in some of the hardest-hit areas had the resources necessary to stay in operation. Through an emergency grant program, the ASPCA provided over 40 grants totaling over $350,000 to organizations responding to, or impacted by, Hurricane Sandy. The Coalition for the Homeless worked to repair damage to shelters in the New York area. Before the hurricane, 47,000 people were staying in homeless shelters, a 20 percent increase from 2011. Many of the homeless shelters were evacuated and some that offered specialty services, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and youths, were left without heat, while at least one encountered significant flooding. CERF (Craft Emergency Relief Fund + Artists’ Emergency Resources) offered emergency relief to craft artists and emergency resources that benefited all artists. In response to the storm, the organization launched the CERF+ Artists’ Relief Exchange in which artists can post needs and those with things or services to offer to artists can make them available. In addition, it offered grants up to $3,000 and no interest loans for craft artists who have had career-threatening emergencies. Church World Service shipped $480,000 worth of blankets, hygiene kits, baby care, emergency cleanup kits, and school kits to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It also launched a $100,000 appeal to provide relief in Haiti and Cuba. Catholic Charities USA worked with its local agencies to assess needs that Hurricane Sandy created in communities and provided immediate services. It estimated that 50 of its local agencies provided direct relief. In the months following Hurricane Sandy, Catholic Charities USA distributed approximately $2.75 million worth of grants and in-kind donations to Catholic Charities agencies affected by Hurricane Sandy. CCUSA has also pledged to provide additional services in the form of long-term recovery grants totaling roughly $5 million for disbursement over the next five years. Collegiate Church Corporation designated $200,000 to Hurricane Sandy relief. The organization’s five ministries are engaged in hands-on recovery work in Staten Island, the Rockaways, the New Jersey shore and the East Village. They distributed food and supplies and helped with clean up and rebuilding efforts. Episcopal Relief and Development remained in contact with key diocesan staff to gather information about where damage had occurred and what the most pressing needs were. Many Episcopal congregations launched into action, expanding their feeding ministries, providing basic supplies and gas cards, and hosting community agencies that connected people to services and federal disaster funds. Feeding America member food banks provided food and other supplies to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. More than 243 truckloads of food and grocery products–or 7.6 million pounds — were distributed to 11 food banks and more than $1 million was secured from corporate partners. Hands on Network, an enterprise of Points of Light, registered volunteers to respond to the disaster. Humane Society of the United States deployed more than 140 staff and volunteers, helped rescue more than 350 animals from devastated areas, cared for more than 700 animals in emergency shelters, and helped set up four distribution centers for supplies. With the HSUS’ help, owners reclaimed more than 400 pets in total. Jewish Federations of North America launched the JFNA Hurricane Relief Fund to contribute to recovery and rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The Jewish Federation system across the continent raised $7.4 million to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. The funds already have gone toward basic amenities like food, clothing and housing, and will continue to be allocated for long-term needs. International Medical Corps mobilized emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas of Haiti. In addition to medical care and screenings, IMC also distributed hygiene, shelter and kitchen kits to internally displaced families. Medical Reserve Corps instituted numerous preparedness and response activities related to Hurricane Sandy. The units that performed sheltering functions reported staffing and/or assisting in the setup of general community, functional, or special needs shelters and working at shelters in support of the American Red Cross. Units also indicated that they provided the community with health education, emergency communications support, and surge staffing to local hospitals, emergency management agencies, and public health departments. Islamic Relief USA worked with Smile, a local organization in New Jersey, to distribute food parcels to families in need in New Jersey. IRUSA staff and volunteers also provided shelter management services and helped however else needed at two separate hurricane shelters on the campus of Rutgers University until the shelters closed on Nov. 2. IRUSA also worked with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help with cleanup efforts across New Jersey and New York. National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD) collaborated with state VOAD members and helped to coordinate on a regional, multi-state level. The organization also posted two resource papers on its website, on providing food to infants and children in a disaster, and promoting the Disaster Distress Hotline. New York Cares, an organization that mobilizes volunteers in the city year-round, kicked off its annual coat drive earlier than usual to meet needs caused by Sandy. The organization gathered coats at the Veteran’s Day Parade. Presbyterian Church in America – Mission to North America worked closely with local church leadership to assess needs. The organization also worked through VOAD affiliations to determine specific needs. It also mobilized volunteers to assist in Atlantic City. Quality Parks documented the impact of the hurricane on the beaches in the region and sought donations to begin a Long Island Master Naturalist program, which will train volunteers in four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Salvation Army served first responders and survivors at 16 shelters throughout New Jersey, and provided meals in 12 counties. In New York City, it is coordinated the city’s Food Access Plan, overseeing distribution of food and water to 17 sites in Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. In Nassau County, N.Y., meals ready to eat provided by the state and 1,000 blankets provided by The Salvation Army were distributed to residents of Island Park, one of the hardest hit areas. And in nearby Suffolk County, the Salvation Army worked to distribute in-kind donations for Sandy survivors. Samaritan’s Purse coordinated more than 8,600 volunteers who cleared debris, removed downed trees, and made emergency repairs for more than 1,300 homeowners. The organization also helped 40 people return home over the course of the next two years by making repairs and building new homes are at no cost to homeowners who were chosen because they lacked the means to restore their own homes or because they lost their houses completely in the hurricane. Save the Children delivered food, hygiene supplies, blankets, toys and children’s clothing to children and families in shelters. This included supplemental food for 15,545 children and their families and 150,000 diapers and other infant hygiene supplies for families with young children. They opened storm-tested Child-Friendly Spaces at 16 shelters for children who did not have safe places to play. These spaces benefited 1,485 children. Save also helped nearly 30 local centers to re-open, through grants or distributions of materials. Save the Children raised more than $3 million for the Hurricane Children in Emergency Fund. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief (SBDR) volunteers prepared more than 1 million hot meals within two weeks of landfall of Hurricane Sandy. More than 1,000 SBDR volunteers assisted victims of Hurricane Sandy. Sparkrelief.org helped feed more than 4,000 people, and partnered with Aubuchon Hardware to collect and distribute goods donated by thousands of people, and helped Lush Cosmetics distribute over $40,000 worth of bath products to those in need along the coast in New York and New Jersey. World Renew rapid response teams served in the New Jersey communities of Midland Park, Little Ferry, and Union Beach to remove downed trees, clean-out flooded homes, and prevent mold. Regional and project managers and staff assisted many communities in the early planning stages for a long-term recovery. World Renew provided start-up grants to committees in Bergen, Monmouth, and Middlesex Counties in New Jersey. World Vision disbursed over $2.4 million in assistance while working with strategic partners in providing disaster relief supplies, essential items and other non-food items that facilitated long-term recover in neighborhoods throughout New York City. Take Action Ensure the needs of vulnerable populations are being met by disaster response and recovery initiatives. These include the elderly with no young relatives, the physically and mentally disabled (including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder), etc. Invest in organizations that have a history of working in these areas and previous relationships with those involved. Additionally, assess ways to assist vulnerable populations in preparedness. Many residents in New York chose to shelter in place, which was made more difficult as power outages continued to for weeks. While some of those residents were resilient for a few days, as the disaster lingered on, living conditions became extremely challenging. Create preparedness programs that include potential outcomes, as well as weather forecast models that include consequence analysis. Improved risk analysis may help future populations be more willing to move out of harm’s way. Support further research into climate change and its effect on natural disaster occurrence. In addition, consider how this research could be linked to disaster risk reduction strategies. Develop guidelines for protecting children—both physically and psychologically—during and after disasters. Strategies for tracking displaced children, for example, could be improved, and standard protocols could be set for schools and day care centers. Explore more stable and resilient supply chains for medical needs, including prescriptions. Infrastructure damage—especially in areas of large populations—can mean many without access to the help they need. Seek out programs that aim to help with recovery and rebuilding in overlooked areas such as West Virginia, Connecticut, Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. With large population centers like New York and New Jersey affected, some of the less densely populated areas have not received as much media attention or philanthropic support. Learn More Facts & Stats Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. 286 people died, 146 of them in the U.S., making Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as the deadliest hurricane to hit the East cost since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. There were $68 billion in damages, much of it concentrated in New York and New Jersey, placing it among the worst U.S. disasters. Sandy damaged or destroyed 305,000 housing units and disrupted more than 265,000 businesses in New York. In New Jersey, 346,000 housing units were destroyed or damaged, and 190,000 businesses affected. Congress passed a $50.5 billion emergency package of relief and recovery aid. Added to the $9.7 billion previously approved for a federal flood insurance program, the total is roughly in line with the $60.4 billion President Barack Obama requested. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide.

Hurricane Sandy was a post-tropical cyclone that swept through the Caribbean and up the East Coast of the United States in October of 2012. The hurricane began as a tropical wave in the Caribbean and quickly turned into a tropical storm in just 6 hours. It was upgraded to a hurricane on Oct. 24 when it reached 74 mph winds The National Hurricane Center says that the tropical force winds extended 820 miles at their widest. Sandy’s pure kinetic energy for storm surge and wave destruction potential reached a 5.8 out of 6 on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s scale. The total death toll reached 285, including at least 125 deaths in the United States. Puerto Rico: How You Can Help The hurricane caused close to $62 billion in damage in the United States and at least $315 million in the Caribbean. Hurricane Sandy is the nation’s most expensive storm since Hurricane Katrina, which caused $128 billion in damage. New York was most severely impacted due to damage to subways and roadway tunnels. In New York and New Jersey, storm surges were 14 ft above the average low tide. At the height of the storm, over 7.5 million people were without power. The government wants to prevent future disasters from storms by having electrical transformers in commercial buildings hauled to upper floors, the ability to shutter key tunnels, airports and subways, and more.

Read More Panel Finds Flaws with NWS Guidance on Sandy’s Surge By Andrew Freedman Published: May 15th, 2013 , Last Updated: May 16th, 2013 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its final review of the agency’s performance during Hurricane Sandy, finding that while the agency provided accurate forecasts of the storm’s path and strength well ahead of time, there were many shortcomings, including confusing and poorly timed guidance on the expected storm surge.

Credit: billmckibben/twitter It was that record storm surge that caused most of the damage along the New Jersey coast and into New York City, where it inundated every subway tunnel between Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn, and helped cut power to lower Manhattan for days. The surge was also the dominant cause of storm deaths, with 41 victims, the report said. In total, the storm was responsible for 147 direct deaths, the destruction of at least 650,000 homes, and it caused at least $50 billion in damage and left about 8.5 million customers without power. The assessment team, which included meteorologists, emergency management officials, and social scientists from NOAA, FEMA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), focused especially closely on the National Weather Service’s (NWS) forecasts and warnings, including the policies underlying the warnings and watches that were issued; the efficacy of NWS websites as portals for storm information; and the production and issuance of storm surge-related forecasts. The assessment praised the NWS for its advanced notice of the storm’s threat, and for emphasizing its potential to cause significant damage. The agency first highlighted the potential for the storm to bring major coastal impacts with nine days’ lead-time. The forecasts the agency issued, including the surge forecasts, were remarkably accurate, the report found, but it found fault with the ways the forecasts were communicated. In particular, the assessment found that the storm-surge guidance provided by the agency’s various offices were often confusing and lacked any graphical presentation. The storm surge caused coastal flooding to exceed 8 feet above ground level in some areas, including in portions of New York City, and water rise was noted from Florida to Maine, the report said. The report identified the urgent need for high-resolution storm-surge forecasting and communication as the “highest priority need” to emerge from the Sandy review process. “In particular, there is a crucial need for storm-surge graphical inundation guidance,” the report said. In addition, the report said that the issuance of non-tropical watches and warnings did confuse some emergency managers, including the New York City Office of Emergency Management. That finding lends credence to the possibility that the lack of a hurricane warning, along with confusion over Sandy’s storm-surge potential, played a role in the actions of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who initially downplayed the storm’s potential impacts in a press conference two days before the storm made landfall, only to reverse course and order the evacuation of low-lying areas the next day. “(The) NYC Office of Emergency Management (OEM) was confused about the storm-surge forecast, what and where the impacts would be, and how high the water would rise,” the report said. After a press conference on Oct. 27, at which Bloomberg had downplayed the storm’s threat, in part because it was not predicted to be a hurricane at the time of landfall, staff at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) called the OEM directly. According to the report, the city’s emergency managers considered the call to be “an eye-opener” about the potential storm-surge impacts in the city. “This apparent communication breakdown may have delayed critical decision making about evacuations and led to potentially confusing messaging to the public,” the report said "It is not expected to be a tropical storm or hurricane-type surge," Bloomberg said on Oct. 27. "With this storm we're likely to see a slow pileup of water rather than a sudden surge which is what you would expect from a hurricane and which we saw with Irene 14 months ago, so it will be less dangerous but make no mistake about it there will be a lot of water and low-lying areas will experience flooding." In response to the NOAA report, the OEM said the storm surge forecast for New York changed between Oct. 27 and 28, which is why the evacuation was ordered on the 28th. "NOAA's characterization of OEM and other Emergency Managers as 'confused' in its review of the surge data provided by NWS fails to address a key fact: The NWS surge forecast provided to OEM changed significantly between October 27 and 28 — from 4-8 feet to 6-11 feet. This was the key driver of the city's decision to order an evacuation on October 28," an OEM spokesperson told Climate Central. The report found that even NWS personnel were confused by the ways in which NOAA measures storm surge, such as the height of water above the often-cited Mean Lower Low Water level. Perhaps most importantly, the report found that the NWS and media were unable to translate the storm-surge forecasts from mere numbers to effective graphics and impact information. “The public and NOAA/NWS partners did not clearly understand what storm surge was or how dangerous it could be,” the report said. “Most of the media representatives the Service Assessment Team interviewed believe NWS is not giving them any means to communicate predicted surge impacts to the public.” One anonymous media representative quoted in the report said, “There were forecasts, but there were no details about what the predicted surges would cause . . . There was no wording in the warning like, 'Most of lower Manhattan will be underwater at a certain point' or, 'Staten Island will flood up to Beach Street.' ” NWS Director Louis Uccellini said he intends to implement the report's 23 major recommendations for service improvements. “I was very impressed with the thoroughness of the job that they did,” Uccellini said in an interview regarding the assessment team's work. “We’re going to appraise the report, work with it, and implement it," he said. A GOES-13 satellite image taken on Oct. 29, 2012 shows Hurricane Sandy centered off of Maryland and Virginia. Credit: NOAA The report also cited a March 2013 poll that found that 79 percent of coastal residents surveyed said the storm-surge impacts in their area was “more than they expected.” In response to Hurricane Sandy as well as other recent storms, such as Hurricane Isaac in 2012, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is currently developing storm-surge warnings and plans to roll out new inundation maps on a trial basis as soon as the upcoming 2013 hurricane season, which kicks off on June 1. The storm-surge warnings, however, will take at least another year to test and roll out. The report found the NWS is impeded by a staffing shortfall in its storm-surge unit. Currently, the agency has just one full-time federal storm-surge forecaster at the NHC in Miami, along with two private sector storm-surge model developers. The assessment found that the NWS made the decision not to issue hurricane warnings north of North Carolina due to the strong preference from the emergency management community, and at least one governor, that the warning type not change even if the storm were to transition from a tropical storm or hurricane into a post-tropical cyclone, as computer models predicted it would do. Under policies in place at the time — which have since been changed — if a hurricane were to transition into a post-tropical cyclone prior to landfall, then local Weather Service forecast offices would be given responsibility for issuing non-tropical watches and warnings, rather than continuing to have hurricane warnings in place and coordinated from the National Hurricane Center in Miami. In Sandy’s wake, NOAA has revised this policy, and has given the NHC the option to continue to keep hurricane watches and warnings in place even after a storm has transitioned into a post-tropical stage. This new policy will enable NOAA to be consistent in the way it names tropical storms and hurricanes and issues warnings for them, and will prevent situations like Sandy in which forecasters are presented with an array of less-than-ideal options, each with the potential to confuse the public about how serious a storm really is. Critics of the NWS’ decision not to issue hurricane warnings have contended that perhaps more people would have evacuated ahead of the storm, had those warnings been issued. However, the assessment report rebuts that line of criticism by citing social science research showing that the lack of hurricane warnings did not cause people to react with reduced concern. Based on post-storm surveys, the report said that many people actually thought they were under hurricane watches or warnings when the storm struck, and that their level of concern “did not differ substantially” from respondents who thought a different type of warning was in effect. “Many vulnerable residents ignore evacuation orders, even when they are accompanied by hurricane watches/warnings,” the report said. While singling out the NWS New York and New Jersey offices for praise, the assessment faulted the NWS for the difficulty users had in finding critical information easily on the agency’s myriad different websites and social media platforms, noting that NOAA websites received close to 1.3 billion hits during the storm. The team found that the heavily trafficked Hurricane Center homepage, for example, did not contain the flood and high wind warnings and storm bulletins from local forecast offices, as well as storm-surge information, issued by each office. The lack of a one-stop-shop for online information about the storm was problematic, and the New York OEM told the assessment team that they relied on a non-NOAA website for storm-surge guidance, which they found easier to use. The report found that the NWS is ill-positioned to take social science insight about how people process and respond to storm-related information into account when wording its warnings and designing its graphics and websites, which can lead to ineffective products. The NWS, the report said, has only one employee with doctoral-level training in a social science field, and the underrepresentation of social science expertise within the agency has hindered the effectiveness of the agency’s risk communications, especially during major events such as Sandy.

(NOAA National Hurricane Center/Reuters) Hurricane Sandy bore down on the East Coast Saturday, on its way to becoming an unprecedented superstorm that could pummel the city and leave millions of people in the Northeast without power. Residents across the region scrambled to prepare for the onslaught of weather, stocking up on supplies while city officials mulled whether to order evacuations of low-lying areas and the suspension of the mass transit system. Advertisement Gov. Cuomo instructed the MTA to prepare for a shutdown, but the final decision about closing the subway and bus system won't come until Sunday night. "The bottom line on this is we're planning for the worst and hoping for the best," said MTA Chairman Joe Lhota. "I think it's very important that all of the New Yorkers know what is the possibility, with the critical date being 7 p.m. tomorrow night," he said. SEE BELOW FOR EVACUATION INFORMATION FOR NEW YORK CITY A systemwide shutdown — which happened only once before, during Hurricane Irene last summer — would take several hours to go into effect, with the final train coming to a stop around 3 a.m. Monday. Commuter rails would also go dark and MTA-run bridges would be shut down if winds eclipse more than 60 mph, effectively grinding the city to a halt.

A Sandy-Type Hurricane Won't Hit For Another 700 Years, Hubristic Scientists Swear Scientists say that a series of unlikely forces combined to create Hurricane Sandy—and that such a convergence won't happen again for another several hundred years, a new study shows. (Read it in full below.) Sandy was unique thanks to several factors, said Timothy Hall, a senior scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and co-author of the study. The perpendicular angle at which the storm struck the East Coast was abnormal, and the storm's direction was influenced by "a region of high pressure" that essentially forced Sandy into the coast. “The sustained winds towards the coast from the direct path is continually pushing a wall of water onto the coast, and you can get a greater surge magnitude, compared to more typical in-land winds sweeping along the coast," Hall told LiveScience. Other factors: Sandy was large, even out at sea, and a full moon that created tides 20 percent higher than normal. So all those above-ground alien bathrooms at Coney Island are just for show? No no, scientists say, waving their hands. Not by a long shot. Global climate models show that hurricanes will only grow more intense as the earth continues to burn hotter, although there may be fewer hurricanes overall. Melting glaciers and warmer oceans will lead to more powerful storm surges, and flooding will worsen thanks to the higher water vapor content of warmer air. As we learned last week, sea levels will rise four to eight inches by 2020—possibly even 11 inches! Gothamist is now part of WNYC, a nonprofit organization that relies on its members for support.

Tag: Sandy winds East Coast view of Hurricane Sandy, GOES Imagery from NOAA. October 27th 2012. Sandy has become so large that typical floater imagery doesn’t capture the entire storm. As of 11am eastern from the National Hurricane Center: Maximum sustained winds are near 75mph Minimum central pressure is near 958mb Sandy is moving North-Northeast at about 9mph. Sandy is doing a balancing act north of the Bahamas where it is trying to deepen (lower its central pressure) and expand its wind field at the same time. Fluctuations in its maximum wind speeds have been the result, and Sandy will likely continue to be at borderline hurricane status until Sunday night when it will try to strengthen as it gets energized by its merger with the trough over the interior Eastern United States. Hurricane Sandy’s pressure fell from 969mb at 11pm last night to 958mb at 11am this morning indicating deepening. While its maximum radius of tropical storm force winds expanded from 275miles at 5pm yesterday, to 450miles at 5am this morning. All Hurricane Warnings have been discontinued for now, but tropical storm conditions are still occurring in the northernmost Bahamas, offshore of Florida and North and South Carolina where tropical storm warnings are in effect. Further advisories, watches, and warnings will be needed as Sandy approaches, potentially from North Carolina to Maine. East coast states have already declared states of emergency and some evacuation notices have been posted in advance of Sandy’s landfall which is forecast to be somewhere in New Jersey or the Delmarva peninsula. Official National Hurricane Center track for Hurricane Sandy as of 11am Eastern Time. Tropical Storm Warnings for parts of North and South Carolina and the Bahamas in blue, and Tropical Storm Watches in yellow for parts of South Carolina and Bermuda. Impacts…Heavy flooding rain over 6″ in areas is likely near the storm’s path. Areas where both storm surge and flooding rains are a threat may have the flooding exacerbated by the unusually high tides down stream. Heavy wet snow is a distinct possibility in the higher elevations of Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Significant coastal flooding is also likely in areas of onshore winds and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where storm surges are forecast to reach up to 8feet and storm tides may be extreme due to the large changes between low and high tide and the astronomical high tide with the full moon on Monday. Damaging winds (30-60mph) could extend far inland causing tree damage and potentially some power outages. Structurally damaging winds (50-75mph) could occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland. Keep in mind that tropical storm force winds (sustained at >39mph) have been observed more than 400miles from the center of this storm – so even though the storm may make landfall in New Jersey, areas as far north as Maine and as far inland as Ontario and Quebec (including Lakes Erie and Ontario) could see tropical storm conditions. Areas to the south will have offshore winds, and tropical storm force winds will extend less far from the center and will be gustier in nature. In these areas, hazardously low water levels may be observed, especially at low tide. Meanwhile, there could be a period of tropical storm conditions in Bermuda (Tropical Storm Watch) sometime between tonight and Monday night as Sandy continues to expand and passes to the distant west. Squally showers will be the theme here during that period.

Read More Weather Service Halts Review of Its Work During Sandy By Andrew Freedman Published: November 16th, 2012 Just days after commissioning a review of its performance during Hurricane Sandy, the National Weather Service (NWS) abruptly disbanded the review team Thursday, saying that “a larger, multi-agency review of this event may take place” instead. The agency gave no time frame on when another review team might be put in place, or what other agencies might be involved in such a review. NWS Acting Director Laura Furgione told Climate Central that the formation of the service assessment had been "premature" and that she had not seen or approved a charter governing the scope of the team's work. Furgione did not say who approved the initial decision. She said the NWS is committed to having a review, and is trying to speed up the review process.

Consistent with its tradition of evaluating its performance following major and deadly weather events, the NWS had put together a team of experts to conduct a service assessment of the agency’s performance in forecasting the storm and warning the public of its multiple hazards. In a first for the agency, the team was being co-led by someone outside of the agency, Mike Smith of the private weather forecasting firm AccuWeather. Smith has occasionally been critical of the NWS, including in the case of Sandy, although he has praised the agency for its accurate forecasts of the storm's path. “I am writing to inform you that effective immediately we are terminating the spin-up of the National Weather Sandy Service Assessment Team,” a NOAA official told the team via email. “All plans and activities that have started should now cease.” Smith said the team’s work had already begun, a budget had been approved, and he and other team members had already been working late into the night on the analysis. He said the assessment team intended to examine all angles of the event, including the question of why there were no hurricane warnings issued for New Jersey or New York. The storm decimated the New Jersey coastline and left 43 people dead in New York City alone, many from drowning due to the record storm surge flooding. “We very quickly focused on the fact that you had a hurricane approaching the U.S. East Coast and no hurricane warnings,” Smith said in an interview. Susan Buchanan, a Weather Service spokeswoman, said the agency is waiting to see if there is going to be a broader government review before proceeding with its own assessment. “If so, we would want to contribute to and benefit from a full federal collaboration on the overall service assessment. If a broader federal assessment does not move forward, the NWS will conduct an assessment of the agency’s performance as it routinely does,” she said in an email statement to Climate Central. Service assessments are routine investigations that the NWS — which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) — conducts after major storm events, from paralyzing blizzards to deadly hurricanes. Hurricane Sandy was an unusual event, though, because it presented unique forecasting and communications challenges. For example, the storm was transitioning from a tropical weather system to one that more closely resembled a nor'easter of the sort that frequent the Northeast during the fall and winter. The NWS declared the storm “post-tropical” shortly before landfall on Oct. 30, and it never issued hurricane warnings for the New Jersey coast or for New York City, among other areas, choosing instead to allow local NWS forecast offices to issue a multitude of other warnings, such as high-wind warnings. That decision sparked intense opposition among some forecasters who said that hurricane warnings would have galvanized the public, along with political leaders, to undertake more significant preparations ahead of the storm. However, it also provided a major benefit for property owners, since hurricane insurance deductibles typically are not triggered unless a hurricane warning is in effect or a named hurricane makes landfall. As Climate Central reported on Nov. 13, New York Senator Chuck Schumer has asked NOAA not to change the classification of Sandy to a hurricane due to its implications for millions of insurance policies. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, for example, initially downplayed the storm’s destructive potential in a press conference two days before the storm, and waited until a day before the storm’s onset of heavy rains, strong winds, and a deadly storm surge to order the evacuation of low-lying parts of his city. Smith, among others, has speculated that if a hurricane warning had been issued for New York City, Bloomberg would have ordered evacuations earlier, and that may have saved lives.

Presumably, one of the areas that Smith and the review panel would have explored is whether the storm classification would have affected Bloomberg's decisions, and those of other emergency management authorities in the affected region. "Given the scores of deaths and the huge level of damage (according to media reports 100,000+ are still without power), even with excellent forecasts, the Sandy Assessment may have been the most important the National Weather Service has ever conducted. Now it has been stopped," Smith wrote on his blog. According to Smith, the assessment team had been told they could not visit the National Hurricane Center in Miami as part of their investigation, which the team found bewildering, considering that Sandy was a hurricane during much of its trek up the East Coast. “I think there was a level of discomfort at what we were starting to look into. Why there is that discomfort I don’t know, we hadn’t gotten very far,” Smith said. He called the assessment group, which was to be co-led by Nezette Rydell, the forecaster in charge of the NWS’ Denver office, “Very open-minded . . . but obviously when we were told we can’t go to the NHC, that raised several eyebrows. “To have the plug pulled on them as soon as we started asking some interesting questions . . . it’s rather odd to me that the Weather Service would spin this thing up and, to use its word, terminate [it],” Smith said.
Evacuations, shutdowns on East Coast before storm NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tens of millions of East Coast residents scrambled on Sunday to prepare for Hurricane Sandy, which could make landfall as the largest storm to hit the United States, bringing battering winds, flooding and even heavy snow. The massive storm, which has already killed 66 people in the Caribbean, was headed toward a densely populated region that includes Washington, New York and Boston and its effects could be felt for hundreds of miles, officials warned. It could be the largest storm to hit the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. New York and other big cities closed their transit systems and schools and ordered residents of low-lying areas to evacuate before a storm surge that could reach as 11 feet. They warned that power outages could last for days. “We’re expecting the worst, hoping for the best. We’re getting everything off the basement floor. We’ve got two sump pumps but during Hurricane Floyd, we were down there for 17 hours straight sweeping water into the sump pumps,” said Maria Ogorek, a Maplewood, New Jersey, lawyer and mother of three. The U.S. government said it had granted administrative leave to non-emergency federal workers in the Washington D.C area. The New York Stock Exchange said it would close its trading floor on Monday for the first time since Hurricane Gloria in 1985. All stocks listed on the exchange will trade electronically, NYSE Euronext said. President Barack Obama asked residents to heed the orders of state and local authorities to protect themselves from Sandy. “This is a serious and big storm,” Obama said after a briefing at the federal government’s storm response center in Washington. “We don’t yet know where it’s going to hit, where we’re going to see the biggest impacts. Officials ordered many school closures, New Jersey casinos and Broadway theaters prepared to close, airlines got ready to halt flight activity in the New York area, and residents cleared store shelves of vital supplies and food. Related Coverage EVACUATION ORDERS New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered the evacuation of low-lying areas of New York City, from upscale parts of lower Manhattan to waterfront housing projects in the outer boroughs, that are home to some 375,000 people. “If you refuse to evacuate you’re not only putting yourself at risk but also the first responders who will have put themselves at risk in an emergency,” Bloomberg told a news conference. “A lot of them are on their way out but some of them are thinking about (Hurricane) Irene and how they didn’t get damage and I tell them it’s two different animals,” Rivera said, referring to the August 2011 hurricane that brought severe flooding to parts of New Jersey and Vermont. Officials warned that flooding could be particularly severe since the storm’s arrival coincides with a full moon, which normally means higher-than-usual high tides. “The most worrisome aspect of Sandy is the high tides,” said Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee. “With the full moon occurring Monday, with Sandy coming up the Bay, we’re very concerned about flooding in our low-lying coastal areas.” New York City, New Jersey and Philadelphia transit authorities said they would begin shutting down service on Sunday afternoon. Maryland’s transit system, serving some suburbs of Washington, said it would not open on Monday. Amtrak, the passenger rail service, canceled nearly all service on the Eastern seaboard on Monday and would halt its service north of New York along the Northeast corridor. Transit systems in Washington and Boston said they planned to operate as usual on Monday as long as it was safe to do so. Airlines flying into and out of New York’s three major airports were all expected to cease flight activity on Sunday night, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Forecasters said Sandy was a rare, hybrid “super storm” created by an Arctic jet stream wrapping itself around a tropical storm, possibly causing up to 12 inches of rain in some areas, as well as up to 3 feet of snowfall in the Appalachian Mountains from West Virginia to Kentucky. Nasdaq planned to open on Monday despite the transit shutdown and evacuation orders, with big banks putting up key personnel in hotels overnight so that they would be able to make it in to work on Monday morning. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it would suspend floor trading on the NYMEX oil market on Monday, as it is located in the New York City evacuation zone near the Hudson River. It said electronic trading would go on as usual. A woman looks out from the boardwalk in Coney Island as waves come ashore in New York, October 28, 2012. REUTERS/Keith Bedford BROADWAY GOES DARK Worried residents in the hurricane’s path packed stores, searching for generators, flashlights, batteries, food and other supplies in anticipation of power outages. Broadway’s theaters planned to close on Sunday night and remain closed on Monday. New York City, Boston and Washington were among the jurisdictions that announced schools would be shut on Monday. Sandy blew the presidential race off course, forcing Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney to cancel scheduled campaign stops. It fueled fears that the storm could disrupt early voting before the November 6 election. As of 2:00 p.m. EDT/1800 GMT on Sunday, there were fewer than 5,000 customers without power in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, the U.S. Department of Energy said in a statement. While Sandy’s 75 mph winds were not overwhelming for a hurricane, its exceptional size means the winds will last as long as two days, bringing down trees, roofs and buildings and piling up rainfall and storm surge. Hurricane-force winds extended 175 miles from the center of the asymmetrical storm, while its lesser tropical storm-force winds spanned 520 miles in diameter. Sandy was centered about 530 miles south of New York City, at late afternoon on Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. It pushed seawater up over the barrier islands off North Carolina known as the Outer Banks. Sandy was moving northeast over the Atlantic, parallel to the U.S. coast, at 15 mph. Sandy killed at least 66 people as it made its way through the Caribbean islands, including 51 in Haiti, mostly from flash flooding and mudslides, according to authorities. Even with all the warnings, some people tried to carry on with their plans. “I just don’t buy into the hype,” said Kate Sullivan, a 40-year old computer specialist from Alexandria, Virginia, who was headed to Baltimore Washington International airport for a planned flight to Los Angeles. “I’m pretty sure I’m going to end up in LA by the end of the night.” Slideshow (20 Images) Additional reporting by Edith Honan, Caroline Humer, Paul Thomasch, John McCrank and Janet McGurty in New York, Gene Cherry in North Carolina, Dave Warner in Philadelphia, Mary Ellen Clark and Ebong Udoma in Connecticut, Will Dunham, David Morgan and Matt Spetalnick in Washington.

Thursday, October 25, 2012 NOAA: Hurricane Sandy To Make Landfall Near New Jersey MIAMI, Florida -- As of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday, October 25, 2012, NOAA's National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, has issued its tropical weather outlook due to the presence of Hurricane Sandy in the Caribbean Sea and Tropical Storm Tony in the central tropical Atlantic. Hurricane Sandy is located about 300 miles southeast of Miami, Florida with maximum sustained winds of 105 miles per hour - making Sandy a Category 2 Hurricane. Hurricane Sandy is moving to the north at 16 miles per hour. NOAA's storm tracker forecasts that Hurricane Sandy will remain at hurricane strength as it approaches the Bahamas today. Hurricane Sandy is forecast to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane after it crosses the Bahamas into the open Atlantic less than 200 miles off the South Florida coast on Friday, and less than 200 miles off the Central Florida coast on Saturday, and less than 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Sunday. Later in the week, Hurricane Sandy is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm and make landfall on or around New Jersey on Tuesday. New York City, Boston, and Washington D.C. are all within the current landfall forecast cone of uncertainty. NOAA warns that a storm surge of 5 to 8 feet is possible for the Hurricane Warning area in the Bahamas, and 1 to 2 feet within the Warning Area for the Florida coast. Warning areas are displayed in the above image. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Tony is located in the central Atlantic and not expected to impact any land within the next 48 hours. Elsewhere in the Atlantic, tropical storm formation is not expected during the next 48 hours.

Update: Hurricane Sandy Hits U.S. East Coast, What You Need to Know GOWANUS, NEW YORK CITY--The winds continue to increase here, howling past windows and splattering the rain. Tiny beads of water almost feel like sand when you step outside thanks to the strong gusts. Such is Hurricane Sandy as it speeds into the New York metropolitan region and prepares to turn and slam in slow motion into the southern coast of New Jersey tonight. At the same time, the storm will be merging with other weather systems to form what's known as a "post-tropical cyclone," or Frankenstorm as some meteorologists have called it in honor of the approaching Halloween holiday. And this Frankenstorm will be capable of dropping as much as three feet of snow in the mountains of West Virginia while dumping rain as far east as Rhode Island. In fact, Hurricane Sandy stretches more than 1,000 miles, exposing a vast swath of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard and inland to hurricane force winds of as much as 90 miles-per-hour. Winds are being affected from Maine to Florida and inland as far west as the Mississippi River. And the storm won't stop for a few days. Already, sea levels are elevated from North Carolina up through Long Island, New York. These high water levels will rise an extra foot or two thanks to an assist from the full moon, a lunar high tide tonight that will repeat over the next few days as the tide cycles in and out every 12 hours or so. "It's going to take until Tuesday or Wednesday for the onshore flow [from Hurricane Sandy] to stop and the water to get back to normal levels," said National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb. In fact, locations like New York City's harbor, which are expected to bear the largest storm surge, may see water levels rise nearly 12 feet above normal—or roughly three times as high as the surge from last year's Hurricane Irene. It's unclear how far that water will penetrate into the five boroughs, but New York City has already ordered residents living along much of the 600 miles of coastline in the city and in low-lying areas, like the Gowanus neighborhood in Brooklyn, to evacuate. That's where I live and it's a canal flowing through filled-in swampland—and one of the nation's newest Superfund sites thanks to a legacy of industrial pollution and sewage overflows. And then there's rain, which is already falling steadily. In some places more than a foot of rain may fall, giving rise to the possibility of flash floods and, in coming days, river flooding like that seen in upstate New York and Vermont after Hurricane Irene. Here in Gowanus, the biggest threat may be storm surge paired with the kind of heavy rain that requires the sewer system to discharge directly into the harbor. If those discharge pipes are underwater, the sewer system may back up and overflow back into shower drains and toilets. One thing that will certainly be underwater here is the subway system, which requires electrical pumps to keep it dry even when it isn't raining. "The subway system and saltwater do not mix," noted New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo in his own press conference today. As a precaution, the subway system has been shut down, forcing would-be evacuees to rely on buses or whatever transport they can find. Evacuation is critical, said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, because firemen, police, Coast Guard and other first responders will be put in harm's way attempting to rescue those who decided to shelter in place and ignore the warnings. President Barack Obama urged those of us in affected areas to heed such warnings in his own comments on Hurricane Sandy. Yet, federal postal workers remained out on the streets delivering mail here today and New York City workers were not given the day off, as residents need them working overtime, according to Bloomberg.

Is New York Ready for Another Sandy? A fleet of flooded taxis in Hoboken, New Jersey, after Superstorm Sandy, in October, 2012. Photograph by Michael Bocchieri / Getty Hurricane Patricia, which hit southwestern Mexico last weekend, was the largest recorded hurricane to make landfall off the Pacific, but it was not the only historic storm this October. At the beginning of the month, a tropical weather system formed southwest of Bermuda and intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, with heavy rain and surface winds reaching a hundred and fifty-five miles per hour. Meteorologists called it Joaquin, and predicted that the dangerous storm would soon turn northeast. According to their models, New York City and the surrounding coastal region fell directly within the “cone of uncertainty” where Joaquin could make landfall. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo activated the State Emergency Operations Center, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency, warning that major flooding events were likely. No one wanted to be caught unprepared. (Joaquin did turn out to be lethal and devastating–but in South Carolina, where it joined with other storms to cause severe flooding and fifteen deaths, and in the Bahamas, where it slammed several islands and sank a cargo ship, killing all thirty-three of its crewmembers.) One clear consequence of Superstorm Sandy, which struck the New York City area in 2012, is that everyone, even climate-change deniers, takes planning for extreme weather events more seriously. After Sandy, I reported on why the region’s vital systems for energy, transit, health care, and communications proved so vulnerable to the storm surge. Since then, federal and state governments have spent billions of dollars to rebuild critical infrastructure; hospitals and utilities providers have made major investments in climate security; and “resilience” has become a buzzword in philanthropic and policy circles. Neither adaptation nor resilience is a sufficient response to global warming. Mitigation, which requires converting to an energy system based on renewable resources like sun and wind, is far more urgent. But because the carbon dioxide that we’ve already emitted will produce many decades of rising sea levels, higher temperatures, and more dangerous weather, we have no choice but to adapt. This week, the third anniversary of Sandy, is a fine time to ask what changes the superstorm inspired, and what work remains. During Sandy, corrosive stormwater quickly inundated the subterranean arteries that connect New York and New Jersey, generating widespread damage and causing years of episodic delays on Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Battery tunnels, as workers slowly repair what is, at best, a woefully inadequate transit system. In New York City, the M.T.A. received four billion dollars in federal money for Sandy recovery and resiliency work, which it has spent on innovative deployable flood barriers, such as the Flex Gate and the Resilient Tunnel Plug, more water-resistant submarine cable, two new pump trains, and structural improvements to the tunnels. But Klaus Jacob, the Columbia University geophysicist who issued prophetic warnings about the city’s fragile infrastructure before Sandy, worries about other openings, “like subway entrances and open-sidewalk ventilation grids.” As he sees it, despite the system upgrades, “most M.T.A. facilities and operations remain vulnerable.” Jacob is also concerned about the fragile power grid, where breakdowns left eight million households without power during Sandy, some for two weeks. On Long Island, where trustees of the Long Island Power Authority spent just thirty-nine seconds discussing Sandy during a two-hour meeting that took place four days before Sandy hit, and ninety per cent of its 1.1 million customers lost electricity, improving system performance has become imperative. After Sandy, Governor Cuomo vowed to end the “tragedy of LIPA,” and in 2014 the Public Service Enterprise Group (P.S.E.G.) became the area’s main utilities provider. Since taking over, P.S.E.G. has engaged a year-round tree-trimming program to reduce the risk of downed lines, fortified low-elevation substations, updated transmission and distribution systems, and improved its outage-management system. These changes should provide modest improvements, but an energy system that transmits power across wires hoisted on poles that rest beneath trees will always be susceptible to outages in high winds. No wonder so many Long Islanders have purchased private generators for the blackouts to come. In New York City, where more than half of local power plants are in the hundred-year flood plain, the storm surge from Sandy breached the walls at Con Ed’s East Village substation and caused a five-day blackout in downtown Manhattan. Today, thanks to higher protective barriers and elevated equipment at power stations, a recurrence on that scale is less likely—unless, of course, there’s a prolonged and severe heat wave, akin to the three-week disaster that hit Europe in 2003, and soaring demand proves impossible to meet. Heat and wind, I learned, are what currently worry leaders of New York City’s medical system, who have spent the past three years protecting against water. During Sandy, the power outage and flooding forced several hospitals and other health-care facilities around the city to close. At New York University’s Langone Medical Center—where generators were served by underground and vaulted fuel oil tanks required by code to be on the lowest level of the building—floodwater cut off backup electricity and made basic caregiving impossible. Administrators report that roughly a thousand medical and professional staff evacuated three hundred and twenty-two patients, including twenty babies who had to be carried down nine floors from the neonatal intensive-care unit and pediatric intensive-care unit after the elevators flooded. Miraculously, there were no fatalities. N.Y.U. had been planning to upgrade its medical facility before Sandy hit, and it received $1.4 billion for repairs from FEMA, plus more from its insurer, after the storm. How is the facility more resilient? According to Paul Schwabacher, Langone’s senior vice-president for facilities management, the backup power systems, MRI machines, and linear accelerators have all been moved from the basement, and a new co-generator will be online soon. Langone has also built barriers that can protect the hospital from Sandy-level flooding, “including a giant hydraulic gate on the F.D.R. service road that we can raise in minutes. In the future, the barriers will be even higher,” Schwabacher said. But for now, Brad Gair, Langone’s vice-president of emergency management and enterprise resilience, added, “No one in New York City is really prepared for a major wind event, and we could be facing Category 3 or 4 hurricanes. The debris from broken windows, construction sites, and even cranes would be truly dangerous.” The same is true for extreme heat, which could mean no power at hospitals for days. At N.Y.U., Schwabacher said, “We’ve invested a lot in backup power systems for air-conditioning, so Langone should be O.K., but not all other hospitals. That’s a code requirement for hospitals in Florida, where they have tropical weather, but not in New York. With climate change, it probably should be here, too.” Planning cities for climate change requires going far beyond updated building codes; it also involves what Klaus Jacob calls “pro-building” structures and infrastructures in anticipation of a warmer, wetter, and wilder world. In late 2012, President Obama’s Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force created the Rebuild By Design competition, to promote and develop innovative projects that enhance climate security while also improving the quality of everyday life. (I was the project’s research director, and served on the jury.) The task force selected ten finalists from the hundred and forty-eight initial submissions, and these ten teams did nine months of research and community engagement before submitting final proposals. In June, 2014, Shaun Donovan, the HUD secretary, announced that the federal government would award nine hundred and thirty million dollars to six winning projects in New York and New Jersey, most of which are advancing toward development. The winning designs address a range of problems, from threats to the food-supply chain at Hunts Point to flash flooding and storm surges in Jersey City, Weehawken, and Hoboken and sustainable development in the Meadowlands. The highest-profile project is the BIG U, by the Bjarke Ingels Group, a storm-protection system for lower Manhattan that transforms barriers into bridging berms that add verdant parkland and recreational spaces to what’s currently a flood-prone concrete and asphalt riverscape. (Federal funding covers the most urgently needed section of this project, which protects a cluster of public and other low-income housing on the Lower East Side.) The most noteworthy project may be Living Breakwaters, by Scape/Landscape Architecture, which creates a “reef street,” consisting of rocky sloped walls in the ocean that host micropockets of habitat complexity (such as finfish, shellfish, and lobsters) along one coastal stretch of flood-prone Staten Island, as well as a network of “water hubs” where people can congregate to learn and play. The breakwaters may not protect low-lying neighborhoods from a hurricane, but they will reduce the risk of wave damage, flooding, and erosion from routine inundation. The cultural and pedagogical programs at the water hubs will help visitors understand their place in the local ecosystem, and what they can do to restore it. Staten Island, which had the highest number of Sandy-related deaths, is extremely vulnerable to the weather that’s coming, and neither Living Breakwaters nor more traditional seawalls were enough to assuage anxieties in neighborhoods such as Oakwood Beach, Ocean Breeze, and Graham Beach. After Sandy, homeowners in these areas organized and won public funds to relocate to higher ground, beginning the process of “managed retreat” from rising seas that, as Klaus Jacob and other climate scholars insist, is inevitable, not only in remote islands like the Maldives but in affluent cities such as New York and Miami. Relocating entire coastal communities is expensive, especially in the short term, and for every Staten Islander who received a state buyout there are several others who were rejected. For now, at least, their only options are to elevate their home at great expense, sell and suffer the lost value, or pray that the water doesn’t return. Neighborhood organizations throughout the region have pursued other ways of becoming resilient. During Sandy, the Red Hook Initiative—a youth-services organization that primarily helps public-housing residents in a flood-prone, low-income section of Brooklyn—transformed into a disaster-relief operation, distributing thousands of meals, assisting frail neighbors, and coördinating help with all kinds of emergency repairs. Since then, Jill Eisenhard, the group’s founder and executive director, reports, R.H.I. has trained a hundred and twenty-seven NYCHA residents to assist their neighbors in case of an emergency, and has created physical and virtual hubs for residents to post and receive information. “A lot of people used it for updates when they heard Joaquin might hit us here, but these sites are active all the time, not just during emergencies, so there’s no need to learn a new behavior during a crisis,” Eisenhard said. Like many neighborhoods where philanthropists and policy makers try to promote resilience, Red Hook recently developed a formal community emergency plan, called Ready Red Hook. And, like many community leaders who fear that the coming heat waves, hurricanes, and superstorms will overwhelm their neighborhoods’ defenses, Eisenhard worries that the plan is “not very strong should someone attempt to implement it.” She understands that she and her neighbors will be the true first responders when the next disaster strikes, and that, as during Sandy, they will wind up taking care of each other. But she hopes policy makers won’t think that resilience training or emergency planning are substitutes for more substantive investments in climate security, or in the neighborhood’s everyday health and well-being. On both counts, people in places like Red Hook need much more help than they’re getting. Perhaps that’s inevitable. Adapting to global warming is already expensive, and if, as climate scientists expect, rising sea levels will someday render large sections of low-lying coastal cities uninhabitable, triggering mass migrations and security risks, it may ultimately break the bank. As the costs of climate change accumulate, affluent nations and neighborhoods will have far more resources to defend themselves than poor ones. Whether deluge or drought, fire or wind, the Red Hooks of the world will usually fare worse than the Upper East Sides. We know that, of course, but it’s one thing to acknowledge environmental inequalities and another to correct them through social policies and city plans. As we remember Sandy, we shouldn’t forget that the storms of the future will not only be problems of global warming but of social justice as well.

It had been destroyed by a piece of the boardwalk that had crashed through their fence. Ruth Fremson/The New York Times We decided to not evacuate. We left for Irene and nothing — no water, no loss of electricity — just a night spent at my in-laws’ in an uncomfortable bed. We knew this would be worse, but we felt safe staying. The kids watched movies, I made a beef stew and we played board games. It reminded me of the harmless power outages from my childhood, when we would all spend quality family-time together. It was nice. Then the water broke through the garage door, folding it in half. Around 7:40 p.m., the power went out. The kids went to bed, and we listened to the radio: when was high tide, when was low tide, was it over, was it just starting, had the eye passed? All we knew was it was bad and getting worse. Kerry and Jim Price with their children, from left, Jake, 4; Kelsie, 8; Kiera, 10. Ruth Fremson/The New York Times My husband noticed an orange glow out the window, a fire that looked about two blocks away - or was it? Within about two hours, the fire was right across the street. Embers were crashing off the roof, the scent of smoke filled the house and we could hear the loud booms of wood snapping and burning. There was a gas station on the corner. Would it blow? After a frantic few minutes trying to think clearly, we found jump ropes and woke the kids. I tied the two oldest to me and Jim tied the youngest to himself. My mom held my hand. And we walked. When we stepped off the stoop, the water was up to my waist and the girls were walking alongside me. As we approached the corner, it got deeper and deeper. When I stepped off the curb, the water was at my neck and the kids were screaming that they couldn’t stand. I kept walking. We arrived safely at our friends’ house. I collapsed, sobbing in a heap in their entryway. We were soaked. I couldn’t untie the ropes because my hands were shaking so badly. I relive that walk in my dreams. Sometimes, I stumble and fall. I drop one. Or the rope breaks. I am swallowing water. The dreams are less frequent now than they were a year ago. But they are still with me. Millie Gonzalez Union Beach, N.J. “I just want to be O.K.” Aine Pennello When her one-story Union Beach, N.J., home flooded during Hurricane Sandy, Millie Gonzalez, who uses a wheelchair to get around, moved in with her sister and is now in a home that does not meet her physical needs. Aidan White Long Beach, N.Y. “Baseball became one of the only ways my friends and I could hang out. And, from our crowded stands, the parents did, too.” Hurricane Sandy took a lot from me, but it gave me baseball. I came back to Long Beach the morning after Hurricane Sandy. I was more in shock than I was scared. I’ve lived here since I was 3 months old, and just to see everything broken and destroyed was a lot. We didn’t have any power, so I couldn’t really call my friends. I tried to walk to their houses, but most had been displaced by the storm. My school was destroyed. The bay and the ocean filled it up, so we couldn’t go back there all year except for the graduation. They hurried to get the gym ready for us to graduate in. I graduated this year from elementary school. My house is still a mess. We have plywood for floors, exposed wires dangling from the walls, beach chairs and a lounge chair in place of a couch in the living room. Because there was more than 50 percent damage, we either have to destroy my house or raise it, according to FEMA. But I have baseball. My year, the current 11-year-olds, had never had a Tidal Waves traveling team because there was never enough interest. But after the storm the interest grew. We needed a way to get together and see everyone. Baseball became one of the only ways my friends and I could hang out. And from our crowded stands, the parents did, too. We had a great season — made the playoffs — and we definitely had the loudest fans. We made up chants for each kid, to try and throw off the other team’s pitcher. The chant for me was “Big Red.” Our team cheer: “1-2-3 Beach.” And this season was only the beginning. We’re practicing through the winter, playing in a spring and summer league, and going to Cooperstown for a week next year. So Sandy made everything really hard. But it also gave me more of the sport I love. Best of all: I even hit two home runs in one game. — As told to Nick Corasaniti Vincent Solomeno Sea Girt, N.J. “A year on from Sandy, we’re still living this storm.” Capt. Vincent Solomeno, command historian of the New Jersey National Guard and curator of the National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey, with artifacts that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Our disaster plan called for us to move everything in our facility up two feet off the ground. We moved it up four feet, but when the storm hit us, that had little or no positive effect. I went to the museum the afternoon of the storm, and already the water was up to my waist. The storm surge had crashed through our building and knocked over display cases, filing cabinets, storage units. I was the last person to leave the installation. I have a curator’s sense of responsibility for the artifacts in our collection, but it just became too dangerous, so when the power went out I traveled to a nearby armory and weathered the storm with other National Guardsmen and soldiers and airmen, and at first light I made the trip back. I pulled up to the building. It looked just like it did on any other day because the water had receded. But when I entered the facility, it was very apparent that the storm surge had crashed through the building and knocked over everything. Ironically, the Intelligent Whale submarine (the only surviving Union Navy sub from the Civil War), did not float. It seemed then like everything else did. Captain Solomeno with the Intelligent Whale submarine, in the background. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times One of the supreme ironies of our experience in the storm was that the very folks who we would call on to help us, were engaged in real-world challenges helping families and homeowners with their lives and properties. So I was briefly here at the museum and then I was part of the search and rescue effort initially in Union Beach, N.J., which was my old hometown, going house to house with local law enforcement, knocking on doors, making sure that the elderly or handicapped weren’t stuck in their homes. We were looking at streets that looked like bombs had gone through them, walking on rooftops that now littered the roadway. In one section all that was left was the foundation of homes. It was heartbreaking to me to walk down streets where I knew almost everyone, and where I had family members who lost their homes. A year on from Sandy, we’re still living this storm. We’re still less than half the size we were. There was damage to 85 percent of our collection during the storm. Three hundred small arms were damaged. We have continued to work every day on these artifacts to stabilize them so that they don’t deteriorate any further. The oldest weapon was an 1816 musket, and the newest weapon was a demilitarized weapon that had been used in the Gulf War. The only things we lost were a trunk full of socks from World War II and some flags from the World War II era. — As told to John Leland Kim Spinella Babylon, N.Y. “There was muck everywhere.” Aine Pennello After Hurricane Sandy, Kim Spinella and her family spent four and a half months in a motor home parked in the driveway of their Babylon, N.Y., house. A year later, the construction goes on. Adnan Rangwala Ronkonkoma, N.Y. “His personality is not any less gusty than the winds of that day.” Adnan Rangwala and Farida Harianawala with their son, Burhanuddin, who was born on Oct. 30, 2012. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Our child was due on November 4. On Sunday, Oct. 28, my wife was really worried about the storm. The hospital was 15 miles from home. That night she began having contractions, and on Monday morning we called the doctor as the flooding began. He said: “We’re open until 12. You may want to come right away.” Burhanuddin at the hospital.Adnan Rangwala We checked into the hospital at 10 in the morning. The doctor had to find an alternate route to the hospital, and there were just three or four other deliveries happening. She was in labor for 16 hours. At 5 or 6 o’clock the hospital lost power, but the backup power went on, almost seamless. His personality is not any less gusty than the winds of that day. He barely keeps still and is constantly looking to make trouble. But the strangest part of the whole thing? Back in August, several months before the storm, a friend asked if we knew the sex of the child. We said we hadn’t found out and didn’t intend to. Unsatisfied, the friend said he’d nickname the child Sandy since it could be a boy’s or a girl’s name. Some of our friends still call him that, but we prefer his real name: Burhanuddin. — As told to Daniel Victor Maggie Hill Rockaway Beach, N.Y. “I don’t even know what books I had until I look for one and realize I don’t have it anymore.” Lost books still stun me. I look for one, or promise one to a student or a friend, and I’m brought up short. I wanted to give my copy of “Girl In Translation” to a student, a tiny Chinese immigrant whose experience reminded me of a character in the book. Oh right, that got washed away. Seems like a small problem; surely, it is. But it’s not the book, per se, it’s the in-your-face reminder that this event still haunts. Maggie Hill has been ordering new books that seem to come in the mail every day. Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times I’ve been back home since mid-April. Still working out some kinks, but for the most part, like the sign on our Rockaway Beach says, “We’re back. Stronger, better.” Then it’s those lost books. Six bookcases were in my basement, holding the past 30 years of authors I love. All those books, all those stories. I had the classics, signed by authors that I went to listen to, collections of books I had to read in college. When I traveled, I’d bring a suitcase of books home with me. I don’t even know what books I had until I look for one and realize I don’t have it anymore. Can it still be loss when you don’t know you lost it? The books always remind me of the box full of letters my mother had written to me when, at 21, instead of finishing college on time, I spent a year traveling around our country. She didn’t understand what I was doing. You could see there was a lot of fear, and yet it was managed with humor. I kept the letters in the bottom shelf of the far right bookcase. They were in an old Mateus box, like a Christmas gift box of booze, and inside were about 30 letters. She had saved each of my letters, and I saved hers, and we put them together by date when I got back from my travels. Totally unplanned, no aforethought. Just what good letter-writers do when they get a good letter. My mother was clever, funny. She wrote grand letters. I can still feel stunned when I suddenly remember that she’s not here anymore. Doesn’t matter how long ago she passed; she’s as real to me today as she was in her letters all those years ago. Today I’m buying bookcases. I need at least five new ones for the books I’ve already amassed since last October. No big deal; I’m a reader, that’s what we do. And I write letters, though I haven’t actually saved any yet. I’m going to start. I’ll have to get a nice new box. — As told to Daniel Victor Molly Montgomery Portland, Maine “My husband and I decided to move from New York after almost 40 years there between the two of us.” Molly Montgomery and her husband, Lucky Strano, on the porch of the home they recently purchased in Portland, Maine. Craig Dilger for The New York Times I moved to the city in August 2001 as a college freshman from Maine. Two weeks later, I watched the World Trade Center collapse from the front door of my dorm on Union Square West. Anyone who was in the city then would remember that closeness between random strangers, neighbors — it made me fall in love with the city. Over the next 11 years, I moved to Brooklyn, met my husband, finished three degrees, and became an R.N. at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center. I missed my family, but it never felt like the right time to leave. My hospital was evacuated during Sandy and stayed empty for almost three months. I didn’t participate in the evacuation, but I’ll always be in awe of my colleagues who carried acutely ill adult patients down the stairs from our unit on the 17th floor. My husband and I were fine during the storm in our apartment in Williamsburg. I volunteered with friends in the Rockaways, as well as with the Medical Reserve Corps assisting displaced psychiatric facility residents from Queens, and saw just how lucky we had been. We considered the effect of high tides, full moons, low pressure systems, and decided that the risk of another storm like Sandy was too high. I felt isolated in the city, and too far away from my family in Maine. After a lot of soul-searching, my husband and I decided to move from New York after almost 40 years there between the two of us. We’ve been in Portland since February and just bought a home, something that we never could have done in the city. Do I feel like I abandoned my patients, my friends, my city? Absolutely. And I’m unsure how I’ll feel when New York goes through the next destructive event. Probably a little left out – I love New York City most of all when we’re rising to a challenge. Will I regret leaving? I’m sure. I think I’ll always consider myself a New Yorker. But as awful as Sandy was, it reminded me that New York isn’t going anywhere, and it’s okay if I do.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Thursday, October 25, 2012 "Storm Snuck Up on Us" A meteorologist friend in Indiana just relayed a comment about the storm threatening the Northeast having "snuck up on us." Hmmmm. The first posting about Hurricane Sandy striking the Northeast U.S. was at 8:05 am yesterday. What really strikes me as odd is the storm isn't forecast to hit before Monday. So, how could it have snuck up on us? We've moved past, "there is going to be a storm." What we are trying to emphasize now is how to prepare for it (see posting below). Along with, "there was no warning" (when there was), the storm sneaking up on us is one of those things meteorologists get tired of hearing. It seems few understand how meteorologists do what we do.

The devastating scenes from Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey are sadly recognizable to anyone who lived through Hurricane Sandy in NYC or survived Katrina in New Orleans. That the country has endured three of these catastrophes in less time than it takes a person to graduate from high school is deeply troubling, but Dr. Charles Greene, professor of Earth and Atmospheric sciences at Cornell, says that even without another Sandy, NYC increasingly faces the possibility of similar destruction here, thanks to weather systems getting stuck over our heads, most likely as a result of climate change. According to Greene, while Sandy and Harvey had some differences, what made them similar was the way the storms were affected by high-pressure weather blocks. The blocks themselves were the result of arctic warming and a lack of sea ice, which slowed down the jet stream, factors that then helped divert or trap the storms in place. In the case of Sandy, a high-pressure block in the Labrador Sea kept Sandy from taking the traditional route out to sea that many late-season hurricanes tend to take, and instead forced the hurricane towards New York and New Jersey, which Greene said hadn't ever been seen before. Similarly, in Harvey's case, the lack of sea ice and a slow jet stream meant that a hurricane that would usually blow through Houston and into west Texas was trapped over the city for days. "We can't be absolutely sure, and can't say beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this will keep happening," Greene told Gothamist. "But the preponderance of evidence is that this is from climate change." It's difficult to say, according to Greene, whether a blocking system will again encounter a hurricane in the way that led to Sandy. But, he said, "we could get a system set up so we get a tremendous amount of rainfall" and see other extreme weather events because of blocking systems. And with these new weather events, Greene said that "what we have to think about now is not just the intensity, but the duration of a storm. That can really be devastating," as was seen in the almost non-stop rain over Houston. While Greene called New York "tremendously vulnerable," in the same way so many coastal cities are, he also said that of all the major such cities he knows of, the city is "really aware of the situation and is trying to come to grips with it." Greene did warn that it would be difficult and expensive to deal with projected storm surges and flooding from climate change, referencing the possibility of the extremely expensive New York Harbor Storm-Surge Barrier. But he also suggested that and other changes would be worthwhile, when considered in light of the $60 billion in damage caused by just one Sandy-level superstorm. There are also tough decisions ahead for city leaders and residents about where people will live in the future. Calling beaches "rivers of sand," Greene said that in his opinion "people are living in a lot of places where they shouldn't be, particularly on barrier islands." While Greene didn't call for a full-scale retreat from the shore and from beaches, he did say that the conversations about the risks of living there "just have to happen." "We as a scientific community can tell you what our best estimate is for what the sea level rise and inundation will look like over the coming decade. And people need to decide how much risk they're willing to live with," Greene said. He also said that if he was figuring to live past 2050, "I'd have a real problem living in some of those areas near the shoreline. Because you're almost guaranteed to have some severe events near you in your lifetime." And yet, Greene sees signs of hope, like the feasibility of shifting the country's light vehicle fleet to completely electric by 2040 or 2050 to significantly reduce carbon emissions—a direction NYC is already moving in. And while Greene told us that we're so far along in carbon pollution that carbon will have to somehow be captured from the atmosphere and stored, he suggested that could be accomplished by both a new technology to make carbon fiber from carbon sucked from the air, and a microalgae project that he's working on which would also turn the algae into a new liquid fuel source. Change is mostly a matter of political will, he said. "I'm actually an optimist, even though these impacts are terrible," Greene concluded. "It just takes political will to solve them, but right now we're battling vested interests who want to move on with business as usual."

Sandy whipped torrents of water over the streets of Atlantic City, stretching for blocks inland and ripping up part of the vacation spot's fabled boardwalk. The storm surge set records in Lower Manhattan, where flooded substations caused a widespread power outage. It swamped beachfronts on both sides of Long Island Sound and delivered hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Cape Cod as it came ashore. Sandy's wrath also prompted the evacuation of about 200 patients at NYU Langone Medical Center. "We are having intermittent telephone access issues, and for this reason the receiving hospital will notify the families of their arrival," spokeswoman Lisa Greiner said. In addition, the basement of New York's Bellevue Hospital Center flooded, and the hospital was running off of emergency backup power. Ian Michaels of the Office of Emergency Management said the main priority is to help secure additional power and obtain additional fuel and pumps for the hospital. The storm hit near Atlantic City about 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center reported. It packed 80-mph winds at landfall, down from the 90 mph clocked earlier Monday. "I've been down here for about 16 years, and it's shocking what I'm looking at now. It's unbelievable," said Montgomery Dahm, owner of the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, which stayed open as Sandy neared the Jersey Shore. "I mean, there's cars that are just completely underwater in some of the places I would never believe that there would be water." Dahm's family cleared out of Atlantic City before the storm hit, but he says he stayed put to serve emergency personnel. At nightfall Monday, he said the water was lapping at the steps of his restaurant, where a generator was keeping the lights on. Sandy makes landfall Ray Kelly: We're concerned with flooding Sandy sends waves crashing in New York Blizzard conditions hit Appalachians The storm had already knocked down power lines and tree limbs while still 50 miles offshore and washed out a section of the boardwalk on the north end of town, Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford told CNN. He said there were still "too many people" who didn't heed instructions to evacuate, and he urged anyone still in town to "hunker down and try to wait this thing out." "When Mother Nature sends her wrath your way, we're at her mercy, and so all we can do is stay prayerful and do the best that we can," Langford said. And in Seaside Heights, about 30 miles north of Atlantic City, Police Chief Thomas Boyd told CNN, "The whole north side of my town is totally under water." In New York, lower Manhattan's Battery Park recorded nearly 14-foot tide, smashing a record set by 1960's Hurricane Donna by more than 3 feet. The city had already halted service on its bus and train lines, closing schools and ordering about 400,000 people out of their homes in low-lying areas of Manhattan and elsewhere. Flooding forced the closure of all three of the major airports in the area, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty. Water seeped into subway stations in Lower Manhattan and into the tunnel connecting Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, while high winds damaged a crane perched atop a Midtown skyscraper under construction, forcing authorities to evacuate the surrounding area. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters there was an "extraordinary" amount of water in Lower Manhattan, as well as downed trees throughout the city and widespread power outages. "We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations," he said. "The worst of the weather has come, and city certainly is feeling the impacts." The storm was blamed for more than 2.8 million outages across the Northeast. About 350,000 of them were in the New York city area, where utility provider Con Edison reported it had also cut power to customers in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan to protect underground equipment as the storm waters rose. But as water crept into its substations, Con Ed said it had lost service to about 250,000 customers in Manhattan -- including most of the island south of 39th Street. At least five people had been killed in storm-related incidents in New York state, including three killed by trees falling on homes in Queens and in the town of New Salem, near Albany, city and state officials said. Falling trees were also blamed for three deaths reported in New Jersey and one in Connecticut, authorities there told CNN. In West Virginia, a woman was killed in a car accident after the storm dumped 5 inches of snow on the town of Davis, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's office.

Fourteen of the ship's crew of 16 were rescued, but the body of one deckhand was found Monday evening and the ship's captain was still missing Monday night, the Coast Guard said. Sandy had already claimed at least 67 lives in the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. Sandy's storm surges were boosted by a full moon, which already brings the highest tides of the month. And forecasters said the storm was likely to collide with a cold front and spawn a superstorm that could generate flash floods and snowstorms. "It could be bad," said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Rattior, "or it could be devastation." Mass transit shut down across the densely populated Northeast, landmarks stood empty and schools and government offices were closed. The National Grid, which provides power to millions of customers, said 60 million people could be affected before it's over. On Fire Island, off Long Island, the water rose above promenades and docks on Monday afternoon, homeowner Karen Boss said. Boss stayed on the island with her husband despite a mandatory evacuation order. She said they own several properties and a business there and had weathered previous storms. "I'm concerned that it might come into the first floor," she said. "If that's the case, I'll just move into another house that's higher up." Based on pressure readings, it's likely to be the strongest storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The benchmark storm, the 1938 "Long Island Express" Hurricane, contained a low pressure reading of 946 millibars; Sandy had a minimum pressure of 943 millibars. Generally speaking, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro scrawled a plea on the plywood that covered her burger restaurant: "Be kind to us Sandy." The seaside area largely dodged last year's Hurricane Irene, but Cafaro was not optimistic that Sea Bright would be spared Sandy. Its arrival, eight days before the U.S. presidential election, forced President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, to alter or cancel several campaign stops. Obama flew back to Washington from Florida, telling reporters at the White House that assets were in place for an effective response to the storm. "The most important message I have for the public right now is please listen to what your state and local officials are saying," Obama said. "When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate." And in Ohio, Romney asked supporters to drop off items and cash at his "victory centers" to be donated to victims of the storm. "There are families in harm's way that will be hurt -- either in their possessions or perhaps in something more severe," Romney said. By Monday afternoon, 23 states were under a warning or advisory for wind related to Sandy. Thousands of flights had been canceled, and hundreds of roads and highways were expected to flood. And according to a government model, Sandy's wind damage alone could cause more than $7 billion in economic loss. Sandy was expected to weaken once it moves inland, but the center was expected to move slowly northward, meaning gusty winds and heavy rain would continue through Wednesday. On the western side of the storm, the mountains of West Virginia expected up to 3 feet of snow and the mountains of southwestern Virginia to the Kentucky state line could see up to 2 feet. Twelve to 18 inches of snow were expected in the mountains near the North Carolina-Tennessee border. "This is not a typical storm," said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett. "Essentially, this is a hurricane wrapped in a 'nor'easter.'" A mother learns that her newborn is part of a hospital evacuation. Facebook posts from a member of the HMS Bounty turn ominous.

At least 53 people died in New York as a result of the storm. Thousands of homes and an estimated 250,000 vehicles were destroyed during the storm, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion[3] with an estimated $32.8 billion required for restoration across the state.[4] On October 28, President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration for the state of New York.[10] The Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road suspended service beginning 7 p.m. October 27 through October 29 and possibly October 30.[11]Starbucks closed all of its outlets in the city and Long Island on October 28 at 4 p.m. to let employees get home before the transit system shut down. The stores remained closed on October 29.[12] The Tappan Zee Bridge was closed October 29 at 4 p.m. EDT due to wind conditions.[13] Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters on October 26 that the city had begun taking precautions but said at that time there was no call for mandatory evacuations and no plans to suspend the city's mass transit or cancel school. But on October 28, Governor Cuomo ordered the MTA, including the subway, closed and in a press conference immediately after Cuomo's announcement, Mayor Bloomberg ordered public schools closed on October 29.[14] He ordered mandatory evacuations for Zone A[15] which includes the southern tip of Manhattan, the Coney Island-Brighton Beach and Red Hook areas of Brooklyn, the entire Rockaways peninsula, much of Staten Island, City Island, and part of the Throggs Neck area of the Bronx.[16] On October 28, officials activated the city's coastal emergency plan, with subway closings and the evacuation of residents in areas hit during Hurricane Irene in August 2011. More than 76 evacuation shelters were open around the city.[5] The MTA announced that all subway, bus and commuter rail service would be suspended, beginning at 7 p.m. EDT on October 28 and expected to continue suspension through at least October 30.[17] All PATH train service and stations were shut down at 12:01 a.m. October 29.[14] 200 National Guard troops were deployed in the city. All bus carriers at the Port Authority Bus Terminal closed at 3 a.m. October 29. U.S. stock trading was suspended for October 29 and October 30.[18] It was the first two-day weather closure since the Great Blizzard of 1888.[19] All state courts were closed October 29, except for arraignments and emergency applications. NYU Langone Medical Center cancelled all surgeries and medical procedures, except for emergency procedures.[20] While moving ashore in New Jersey, the northern and eastern sides of Sandy were characterized with light, sporadic rainfall, but strong winds. Precipitation in New York reached 3.42 in (87 mm) in Sherman, in the extreme western portion of the state. The highest recorded wind gust in New York was 90 mph (140 km/h) at Islip.[28] Supplemented by spring tide, the storm surge was approximately 14 feet above Mean Low Water,[29] flooding many tunnels and damaging electrical equipment. The 1821 Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane was similarly powerful but struck at low tide and thus caused less flooding. During a news conference on November 1, Mayor Bloomberg announced that most parks would reopen on November 3; that Coney Island, the Rockaways, and parts of Staten Island would get temporary centers for the distribution of meals and bottles of water at a time; that AT&T would bring cellphone-charging and cell service-enabled pods to certain areas of New York City; and that 400 members of the National Guard were to go door-to-door to deliver meals and supplies to elderly and home-bound residents.[29] A relief fund was created for residents of Staten Island. Time Warner Cable donated $500,000 to the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, and $50,000 each to the Red Cross of Northeastern New York and the Red Cross of Northern New Jersey. They also sent out vehicles with mobile charging stations and free WiFi access points, and additionally opened all of their WiFi spots in the city.[31] On November 3, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum was being pumped free of floodwater and reopened on the 6th.[34] Five emergency mobile gas stations were deployed by the military on the same day, offering 10 free gallons per person.[35] Thousands of runners who came to the city to run the New York City Marathon met in Central Park on November 4; due to the marathon's being called off, many went to Staten Island to help storm victims.[36] On November 5, meteorologists began tracking a coastal nor'easter that threatened cleanup and recovery efforts in the state on November 7 and 8.[37] NYU Langone Medical Center, evacuated during the storm, began reopening on the same day,[38] and about 750 workers resumed construction on Ground Zero.[39] Governor Cuomo signed an executive order saying that displaced New Yorkers could vote in the 2012 United States elections at any polling place in the state.[40] On November 7, Governor Cuomo fired Steven Kuhr, the head of the New York Office of Emergency Management, after Cuomo discovered that Kuhr had sent Suffolk County workers to clear a tree in his Long Island driveway as other victims needed help.[31] A day later, Cuomo said that the estimated storm damage in New York state was $33 billion.[1] New York City and the counties of Nassau and Suffolk imposed "odd-even" gasoline rationing, as New Jersey had, to ease congestion and frustration at filling stations. The system began on November 9 in the wake of a shortage.[42] Cuomo also temporarily waived certain taxes and pollution restrictions on fuel deliveries.[43] New York City schools remained closed through Friday, November 2 with classes resuming Monday for most students; but as many as 40,000 stayed home until November 7. Fifty-seven schools were still flooded as of that date.[32] Many colleges and universities and K-12 schools in the tri-state area also cancelled classes.[33][34][35] The Statue of Liberty was closed October 29, a day after its grand reopening. Both the statue and Ellis Island remained closed through 2012;[36] the statue reopened July 4, 2013,[37] while Ellis Island remained closed until 2014.[38] On November 1, CBS News reported the 76 shelters opened initially were being consolidated down to 15.[40] On November 6, Bloomberg announced the closing of parks, playgrounds and beaches again for 24 hours starting at noon November 7, as the nor'easter neared.[41] Also on November 6, John Jay High School in Brooklyn, being used as a shelter for Sandy victims, was shut down after about a dozen storm refugees came down with a stomach virus. Bloomberg said the school would be closed November 7 instead of opening for classes as scheduled, so it could be cleaned and then reopened.[42] As of October 31, 2012[update], MTA bus service began operating on a regular schedule. The subway system was tested with plans to resume limited service to 14 of the 23 services on November 1. PATH services remained suspended; the Long Island Rail Road resumed limited, hourly service; and Metro-North restored hourly service on its Harlem Line between North White Plains and Grand Central Terminal. All bridges and tunnels were open except the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel. Amtrak provided modified service starting on November 1, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal reopened with no Greyhound Lines service or commuter buses to New Jersey.[51] The Holland Tunnel opened to buses only on November 2.[55]HOV restrictions on bridges and Lincoln Tunnel ended on that day. By November 3, 80 percent of subway service was restored.[56] On November 6, the Queens Midtown Tunnel reopened one lane for buses heading into and out of Manhattan during rush hour.[57] The Holland Tunnel reopened November 7 at 5 a.m. EST.,[58] while the Queens-Midtown Tunnel reopened on November 9 at 6 a.m. EST.[59] The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel opened November 12 to limited rush-hour bus service.[60] Delta Air Lines cancelled all flights out of LaGuardia Airport through October 30 at 8 p.m. EDT.[61] The three major airports serving New York City, JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark, were closed as of 8 p.m. on October 29.[62] More than 8,000 flights were canceled by 4 p.m. EDT for the day of October 30. LaGuardia and Newark had a total of 2,400 cancelled flights. As of early morning October 31, nearly 3,000 flights were canceled,[63] but JFK and Newark airports began handling flights after 7 a.m.[51] LaGuardia Airport reopened November 1 at 7:00 a.m.[51] After Hurricane Sandy, large portions of Manhattan were without electricity After many complaints that running the race through affected areas would seem insensitive and would put further pressure on police and other service workers who would be better deployed in the recovery efforts, Mayor Bloomberg announced late afternoon November 2 that the New York City Marathon had been cancelled. The event was to take place on Sunday, November 4. Marathon officials said that it would not be rescheduled.[65] The Emergency Medical Services of New York City faced a series of challenges and setbacks during the storm relating to the flooding, closure, and evacuation of hospitals and FDNY-EMS Stations across the city. Downtown Hospital was closed in preparation for the storm, but several hospitals were forced to close during the storm, including Bellevue Hospital, NYU Hospital, Manhattan VA Hospital, Metropolitan Hospital, Coney Island Hospital, and St. Johns Hospital. A fire broke out on the fourth floor of Coney Island Hospital, which proved difficult for Fire and EMS resources access due to flooding, high winds, and downed wires. Four out of five FDNY-EMS Stations in Manhattan were evacuated during the storm as flooding began to surround stations in low-lying areas, including EMS Station 4 (South Street, location of Division 1 Headquarters which was moved to Downtown Brooklyn during the storm), Station 7 (Chelsea), Station 8 (Bellevue), and Station 10 (Spanish Harlem/Metropolitan Hospital). Station 16, located at Harlem Hospital, did not have to evacuate. On October 29, National Guard troops arrived in Island Park, New York, as anecdotal accounts and earlier reports of a substation explosion were officially denied by a LIPA representative.[70] On October 30, a helicopter rescue crew airlifted five adults and a child from the roof of a Staten Island house which was nearly submerged by flooding waters.[71] On October 31, National Guard troops and local police were evacuating the last of 700 patients from Bellevue to other hospitals and local shelters.[72] On November 6, some of the state's residents that had been evacuated for Sandy were evacuated a second time due to a nor'easter that was expected to bring high winds, rain and possible snow to areas of New York.[73] On November 26, Governor Cuomo said Sandy cost the state $32 billion in damage and loss. Mayor Bloomberg announced earlier in the day that the storm caused $19 billion in losses in New York City, which was included in the estimate Cuomo gave.[74] At the time of the disaster, a total of 43 civilians were confirmed to have died in New York City as a result of the hurricane.[3] As of the morning of November 1, Con Ed had restored two power networks, but there were still more than 600,000 customers without power throughout the five boroughs. Con Ed predicted most all of Manhattan would be fully restored by November 3.[75] By the afternoon of the same day, Con Ed said it expected to "restore the vast majority of customers who lost power by the weekend of November 10 and 11. The remaining customer restorations could take an additional week more."[40] As of the morning of November 2, more than 1.3 million customers were without power, down from 2.2 million. As of 5:00 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) on that date Con Edison said about 226,000 customers lacked service in Manhattan, 84,000 in Queens, 35,000 in Brooklyn, 54,000 in Staten Island 31,000 in the Bronx and 140,000 in Westchester. On Long Island, LIPA said it still had about 532,000 customers without power, down from more than 900,000.[76] In the evening of November 2, LIPA said they expected to cut the number of customer outages by 150,000 by November 4.[77] On October 30, over 190 firefighters fought a six alarm fire that destroyed 111 structures and damaged another 20 in Breezy Point, Queens, as a result of the storm. The area had been under evacuation orders, but some residents rode out the storm. One firefighter and two residents were injured. The rescuers were in chest-deep water and had to use a boat to reach survivors. A transformer explosion is suspected to have caused the fire.[100] On October 31, Breezy Point residents pledged to rebuild their community.[101] Suffolk county suffered an outbreak of fires in the aftermath of the storm with ten separate instances occurring at once as a result of downed trees collapsing on power lines and exploding transformers. Compounded with the floodwaters, the situation taxed first responders heavily, leading to instances where firefighters became trapped due to rising waters as they were working to save affected residents.[89]One home in West Babylon and another in Lindenhurst were burning continuously, and both had to be knocked down with payloaders.[89] Heavy winds caused a construction crane atop One57 to collapse, causing the area to be evacuated on October 29.[82] The crane was secured to the building on November 3 and West 57th Street reopened to traffic that evening.[83] The hurricane damaged many homes beyond habitability. Governor Cuomo worked closely with President Barack Obama and with Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, which was even more hard-hit, to come to their aid. Cuomo allowed New York voters, via a specific provision aimed at accommodating those displaced, to cast provisional ballots for the 2012 election anywhere in New York state.[91] He also appointed a commission to examine the responses of New York utilities to damage caused by the storm, and to help lower the energy costs of residents affected by the damage. The Cuomo administration used $140 million of the funds originally allocated to this commission in order to pay for the broadcast of national TV ads encouraging businesses to return to New York after the disaster.[81][82] Many have been critical of the effort, including former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, who called the ads "fluff" and "a waste of taxpayer money".[81][82] Governor Christie, a Republican, was criticized by fellow Republicans for his public praise of President Obama, a Democrat, during and after his post-Sandy visit to New Jersey. Although Christie endorsed Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 United States presidential election, critics complained that Christie's relationship with Obama following Sandy hurt Romney at the polls.[92][93][94] Several years later, during Christie's own campaign for president, Republican opponents continued to raise the issue of his post-Sandy relationship with Obama.[94][95] The incident was at least partly responsible for Christie's failure to win the Republican nomination for president.[96][97][98] Looters and burglars were arrested in Coney Island, the Rockaways, and other parts of New York City and Long Island which had been evacuated or damaged by the storm.[99] Some posed as Con Ed workers to fool their victims;[100] some other, would-be-looters posed as rescue workers.[101] On November 2, it was reported that "on Long Island, looting has become such a problem on the south shore in the wake of superstorm Sandy that state police are on patrol."[102] In addition to the looting of homes and stores, armed robberies, criminal siphoning of gasoline out of vehicle gas tanks, and thefts of generators were reported. Some New Yorkers ignored advice to evacuate in advance of the nor'easter of November 7–, in favor of protecting their property.[103][104] Thefts were averted by residents, some armed, who surprised those who had broken into their homes; by the National Guard; and by neighborhood watch groups.[105][106] On November 1, a St. Albans motorist was arrested on charges of menacing and criminal possession of a weapon after he tried to cut in line at a Mobil station on the corner of Astoria Boulevard and 43rd Street in Queens and pointed a pistol at another motorist who complained.[107][108][109] Also, in Brooklyn, people argued at a Getty gas station. It was further reported that gasoline, in heavy demand for both vehicles and home generators, had become scarce and frustration with fuel supplies topped "the list of issues causing tensions to boil over in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, the states hardest hit by power outages in the wake of superstorm Sandy."[108] As of November 6, police reported 41 arrests in New York City stemming from fights at gas lines. This excluded the arrest of one teenager in East Setauket, who pulled a knife on a BP employee when told they were out of high-octane gas.[110] In the five days since Sandy first hit New York City, the NYPD reported a slight decline in the number of major felonies compared to the same period during the previous year. There was a 30% drop in robberies and felony assaults, as well as a single homicide compared to 7 homicides in 2011. Reported burglaries, however, had a small uptick from 267 in 2011 to 271 in Sandy's wake.[111]

Read More Research Spawns Stunning Hurricane Sandy Animations By Andrew Freedman Published: January 29th, 2013 , Last Updated: January 29th, 2013 Hurricane Sandy was one of the most destructive storms on record on the East Coast, tearing apart coastal communities from Maryland to Connecticut through a deadly combination of high winds and a record high storm tide. The storm was the result of a rare combination of events, as a purely tropical hurricane transitioned into a large hybrid storm, which had both tropical and extratropical characteristics. In Sandy's wake, researchers have tried to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of this fascinating storm, and their work has already resulted in some interesting insights. Mel Shapiro, an atmospheric scientist who studies how tropical storms and hurricanes transition into powerful extratropical storm systems, recently produced a series of astonishing animated visualizations showing the inner workings of Sandy as the storm moved up the Eastern Seaboard and eventually made landfall on the evening of Oct. 29. These visualizations were produced with an ultra-high resolution computer model run at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Known as the ARW-WRF model, it used data from an operational computer model that the National Weather Service used to forecast the storm. The visualizations help show how Sandy was captured by upper-level winds, and pushed into the New Jersey coast, which was a track unprecedented in the historical record. Shapiro said that the upper-level air that was venting from the storm — think of it as if Sandy were taking a deep breath and then letting that air out — was highly asymmetrical, with most of the outflow streaming toward the Midwest "like a great bow wave," pushing everything in front of it. In an interview, Shapiro said that as the storm approached landfall, colder air wrapping into the storm from the west came screaming around the south side of the storm, producing hurricane-force winds on the storm's southwest flank. That surge of cool air played a crucial role in maintaining Sandy's intensity, or even strengthening the storm, Shapiro said, since it sharpened the temperature gradient — or temperature differences — across the storm. He said he can't recall another storm like this, since it had cold air wrapping around an intact warm core. Tropical storms and hurricanes are so-called warm-core systems, while nor'easters and other extratropical systems have cool air near the center of the storm. “It’s a strange dude, you’ll never see another one like that,” Shapiro said. Whether the storm was still a warm-core system at landfall is fraught with controversy, since the National Weather Service maintains that it had become more akin to a strong nor'easter at the point of landfall, and the National Hurricane Center did not issue hurricane warnings for New Jersey or New York City. The lack of a hurricane warning has major implications for homeowners and insurers, since it means that hurricane insurance deductibles don't kick in. The animation above shows modeled particle trajectories that demonstrate how the low level air comes into Hurricane Sandy and then ascends to the outflow jet at the top of the troposphere. The outflow jet can be seen in red colors moving away from the storm, toward the Midwest. Particle trajectories help show how the air was flowing throughout the storm. This was done by simulating the movement of particles inserted into a modeled storm environment. Credit: Science by Mel Shapiro and Thomas Galarneau.

(CNN) -- Rescuers plucked stranded New Jersey residents from flooded neighborhoods, workers pumped water from swamped Manhattan tunnels and stunned homeowners dug through the wreckage of their houses Tuesday after Superstorm Sandy ripped into the Northeast. "I've lived here for 39 years," Toms River, New Jersey, restaurateur Keith Paul told CNN. "I've been through several hurricanes, going back to Gloria. And I've never seen anything like this at all." Sandy struck land near Atlantic City, New Jersey, around high tide Monday night, whipping up a storm surge that ripped apart piers on the Jersey Shore and inundated subway and highway tunnels in New York. The U.S. death toll rose to at least 33 by late Tuesday, spanning the Eastern Seaboard from North Carolina to Connecticut, plus one in Canada. That's on top of the 67 fatalities inflicted in the Caribbean last week. "I never thought I'd see what I saw today," New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told reporters after spending the day reviewing the damage to his state.

The number of electric customers shivering without power fell to just under 6.9 million, down from nearly 8 million reported earlier in the day across 15 states and the District of Columbia. Two of the New York area's major airports, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty, were slated to reopen Wednesday with limited service. But thousands of people waited in shelters, not knowing whether their homes had survived. Salt water streamed down the concrete canyons of lower Manhattan as utility workers pumped out the passages that run beneath the city. And as if the water wasn't enough, the Queens neighborhood of Breezy Point lost scores of homes to an inferno that erupted at the height of the storm even as other houses within a few blocks were washed away. "In all honesty, it looks like a war zone," Breezy Point resident Mike Long said. "It looks like during the night, that fighter planes or bombers came through and just bombed the entire area. It just looks terrible." Christie said about 1,000 people had been rescued Tuesday. But those efforts were scaled back at nightfall because of the hazards lurking in the dark, swirling water that lingered across much of the region. "There's poles down, there's trees down across wires with transformers blowing up on the street," Paul said. "You go out and walk around, it's dangerous, because if you hit a puddle and it's got electricity -- there's really not much you can do until things get cleaned up a little bit." And in Newark, Mayor Cory Booker said authorities there were still struggling to get help to residents with medical problems. "I've got high-rise buildings with seniors who might be dependent upon power and electricity for medical machines, people who have medicine that requires refrigeration," Booker said. "We have to get to those people, have to get them secure, got to get them to hospital. We still have flooded areas. We still have a lot of challenges." Atlantic City, famed for its beaches, boardwalk and blackjack, became an extension of the ocean as seaweed and flotsam swirled in the knee-deep water covering downtown streets. But while the property damage there was "pretty extensive," Mayor Lorenzo Langford said, "I'm happy to report that the human damage, if you will, has been minimal." One fatality had been reported in Atlantic City, Christie said Tuesday night. Parts of the boardwalk were washed out in the storm, Langford said, but the Atlantic City Alliance, which promotes tourism there, said the damage was limited to a residential area away from the district most tourists visit. Christie said seeing the damage left behind to the state's treasured beaches was "overwhelming," to him "as a kid born and raised in this state." "We will rebuild it. No question in my mind, we'll rebuild it," he said. "But for those of us who are my age, it won't be the same. It will be different because many of the iconic things that made it what it was are now gone and washed in to the ocean." Across the Hudson River, meanwhile, parts of New York could be without electric service for four days, Consolidated Edison President Kevin Burke told reporters. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said restoring power and mass transit were the biggest challenges facing officials in the days ahead. Fires force evacuations in Queens High winds from Sandy knock out power Towns flooded after possible levee break Crane dangles off NYC high-rise iReporters share Hurricane Sandy images "I'm happy to say it's the beginning of a process that we all know will take a while," Bloomberg said. "But this is the end of the downside, and hopefully from here is going up." Free but limited bus service was resumed Tuesday evening to take up some of the slack left behind by the crippled subway system, and the New York Stock Exchange was scheduled to resume trading Wednesday morning. While the East Coast was still grappling with the scope of the disaster, federal officials warned that Sandy was an ongoing concern with the potential to inflict more pain on inland states. The storm was centered about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh and packing 45-mph winds Tuesday evening, bringing flood warnings to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and blizzard warnings to higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountains. "The coastal impacts are certainly less today than they were last night, but the effects are not zero," National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb told reporters in a conference call. Forecasters predict the storm's center of circulation will be north of the Great Lakes by Wednesday. But coastal flooding in the 2- to 4-foot range could still occur "in spots," while the potential for other floods stretched as far west as Lake Michigan, Knabb said. The full scale of Sandy's wrath has yet to be determined. But according to a government prediction, the storm's wind damage alone could result in more than $7 billion. One estimate from Kinetic Analysis Corp., which conducts weather hazard assessments, said the storm's economic impact could be up to $25 billion. In Washington, President Barack Obama pledged the full support of the federal government for recovery efforts. He signed major disaster declarations for New Jersey and New York on Tuesday, clearing the way for federal aid to residents and to state and local authorities. "My instructions to the federal agency has been, 'Do not figure out why we can't do something. I want you to figure out how we do something. I want you to cut through red tape. I want you to cut through bureaucracy.' There's no excuse for inaction at this point," Obama said during a visit to the headquarters of the American Red Cross. "I want every agency to lean forward and to make sure that we are getting the resources where they need -- where they're needed as quickly as possible." The storm's timing a week before the presidential election is tricky for Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Both candidates sought to balance the real threat of a killer storm against the need to squeeze out any last-minute advantages in battleground states ahead of next Tuesday's vote. Obama discarded campaign events in Florida and Virginia to return to Washington and address the storm from the White House. He was scheduled to travel to New Jersey on Wednesday and survey storm damage, the White House said. On Tuesday, Romney swapped campaign rallies for a relief event in Ohio. "We have heavy hearts as you know with all the suffering going on in a major part of our country. A lot of people are hurting this morning," said Romney, adding that he had the chance to speak with some of the governors from the affected areas.

Post-Sandy New York Aims to Rethink Infrastructure, Not Just Rebuild It As New York, New Jersey and the rest of the northeastern U.S. come to grips with Hurricane Sandy's impact, some leaders there are realizing that two debilitating hurricanes in as many years there are a sign that infrastructure there needs rethought, not just rebuilt. Postmortem assessments of Sandy's impact should include a "fundamental rethinking of our built environment," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday during a press conference. "The challenge is not just to build back but to build back better than before." Cuomo called the storm, which has claimed more than 30 lives so far, "frightening" and described scenes around the city that sounded like something out of Michael Bay movie—including lower Manhattan's Ground Zero site flooding and sections of the nearby West Side Highway submerged beneath more than 1.5 meters of water. Overflow from the Hudson River also covered tracks and lapped at the platform along an eight-kilometer stretch of a Path Train tunnel connecting lower Manhattan with New Jersey, the governor added. Roosevelt Island F-Train station--closed. The city's subway tunnels and underground infrastructure are normally an asset for moving millions of commuters and residents around on a daily basis. During a storm of Sandy's magnitude—"when the Hudson River was intent on meeting the East River," Cuomo noted—they become a liability, particularly because the subways share space underground with much of the city's electrical infrastructure. Getting water out of these tunnels is one of the main orders of business, Cuomo said. Sandy flooded seven subway tunnels, three of which had been pumped clear as of the press conference. Water removal is perhaps the biggest challenge that hurricanes create, agrees Phil Bedient, a Rice University professor of civil and environmental engineering. New York City will have to pump out tunnels and basements and run that water into the storm sewer system. "You'll see big pipes, one foot in diameter, all throughout downtown New York as they do this work," he says. This storm sewer system flows out to the surrounding rivers, which have subsided by now. New York City and the surrounding coastal areas present several challenges for storm protection and recovery, in particular the combination of its aging, subterranean infrastructure, high-rise buildings and dense population—all in very close proximity to the water, Bedient says. "What's going to be unique about the East Coast's [recovery] is so much of the infrastructure there is very old," Bedient says. "The tunnels and anything to do with the infrastructure below ground is probably going to be more difficult to deal with compared with some of the more modern infrastructure that exists on the Gulf Coast." Sandy will probably not end up being as devastating as Andrew, Katrina or Ike, but it was a lot worse than most people in the Northeast were expecting, Bedient says. Whereas New York City and the surrounding area experienced four-meter surges at Sandy's worst, Katrina and Ike hit the Gulf Coast with 8.5-meter and five-meter surges, respectively, he adds. Bedient suggests that a three-meter-high dike around Battery Park near Ground Zero could provide some measure of protection for lower Manhattan. "It wouldn't be that hard to do, and it's worked for areas like Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans," he says, adding that the city must weigh the cost of such a levee against, for example, the cost of Wall Street shutting down whenever a comparable storm hits. "You have to begin to think more carefully about long-term protection especially with back-to-back hits." During his press conference, Cuomo noted that other parts of the country have designed their infrastructure to account for coastal storm flooding. "Part of this is the recognition that climate change is a reality, and it's a reality that we're vulnerable," he added. "Protecting this state from coastal flooding is a massive, massive undertaking but a conversation that is overdue and a conversation that should begin."

Site Mobile Navigation Storm Barrels Through Region, Leaving Destructive Path Hurricane Sandy battered the mid-Atlantic region on Monday, its powerful gusts and storm surges causing once-in-a-generation flooding in coastal communities, knocking down trees and power lines and leaving more than five million people — including a large swath of Manhattan — in the rain-soaked dark. At least seven deaths in the New York region were tied to the storm. The mammoth and merciless storm made landfall near Atlantic City around 8 p.m., with maximum sustained winds of about 80 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center said. That was shortly after the center had reclassified the storm as a post-tropical cyclone, a scientific renaming that had no bearing on the powerful winds, driving rains and life-threatening storm surge expected to accompany its push onto land. The storm had unexpectedly picked up speed as it roared over the Atlantic Ocean on a slate-gray day and went on to paralyze life for millions of people in more than a half-dozen states, with extensive evacuations that turned shorefront neighborhoods into ghost towns. Even the superintendent of the Statue of Liberty left to ride out the storm at his mother’s house in New Jersey ; he said the statue itself was “high and dry,” but his house in the shadow of the torch was not. The wind-driven rain lashed sea walls and protective barriers in places like Atlantic City, where the Boardwalk was damaged as water forced its way inland. Foam was spitting, and the sand gave in to the waves along the beach at Sandy Hook, N.J., at the entrance to New York Harbor. Water was thigh-high on the streets in Sea Bright, N.J., a three-mile sand-sliver of a town where the ocean joined the Shrewsbury River. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ’s office said late Monday night that at least five deaths in the state were attributable to the storm. At least three of those involved falling trees. About 7 p.m., a tree fell on a house in Queens , killing a 30-year-old man, the city police said. About the same time, two boys, ages 11 and 13, were killed in North Salem in Westchester County, when a tree fell on the house they were in, according to the State Police. In Morris County, N.J., a man and a woman were killed when a tree fell on their car Monday evening, The Associated Press reported. In Manhattan, NYU Langone Medical Center’s backup power system failed Monday evening, forcing the evacuation of patients to other facilities. In a Queens beach community, nearly 200 firefighters were battling a huge blaze early on Tuesday morning that tore through more than 50 tightly-packed homes in an area where heavy flooding slowed responders. Earlier, a construction crane atop one of the tallest buildings in the city came loose and dangled 80 stories over West 57th Street, across the street from Carnegie Hall . Soon power was going out and water was rushing in. Waves topped the sea wall in the financial district in Manhattan, sending cars floating downstream. West Street, along the western edge of Lower Manhattan, looked like a river. The Brooklyn -Battery Tunnel, known officially as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel in memory of a former governor, flooded “from end to end,” the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said, hours after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York ordered it closed to traffic.Officials said water also seeped into seven subway tunnels under the East River. Joseph J. Lhota , the transit authority chairman, called the storm the most devastating disaster in the 108-year history of the subway system. “We could be fishing out our windows tomorrow,” said Garnett Wilcher, a barber who lives in the Hammells Houses, a block from the ocean in the Rockaways in Queens. Still, he said he felt safe at home. Pointing to neighboring apartment houses in the city-run housing project, he said, “We got these buildings for jetties.” Hurricane-force winds extended up to 175 miles from the center of the storm; tropical-storm-force winds spread out 485 miles from the center. Forecasters said tropical-storm-force winds could stretch all the way north to Canada and all the way west to the Great Lakes . Snow was expected in some states. Businesses and schools were closed; roads, bridges and tunnels were closed; and more than 13,000 airline flights were canceled. Even the Erie Canal was shut down. Subways were shut down from Boston to Washington, as were Amtrak and the commuter rail lines. About 1,000 flights were canceled at each of the three major airports in the New York City area. Philadelphia International Airport had 1,200 canceled flights, according to FlightAware, a data provider in Houston . And late Monday night, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said cabs had been instructed to get off New York City roads. A replica of the H.M.S. Bounty, a tall ship built for the 1962 movie “Mutiny on the Bounty” starring Marlon Brando and used in the recent “Pirates of the Caribbean” series, sank off the North Carolina coast. The Coast Guard said the 180-foot three-masted ship went down near the Outer Banks after being battered by 18-foot-high seas and thrashed by 40-m.p.h. winds. The body of one crew member, Claudene Christian, 42, was recovered. Another crew member remained missing. Delaware banned cars and trucks from state roadways for other than “essential personnel.” “The most important thing right now is for people to use common sense,” Gov. Jack Markell said. “We didn’t want people out on the road going to work and not being able to get home again.” Photo The Red Hook section of Brooklyn was flooded on Monday.Credit Robert Stolarik for The New York Times By early evening, the storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes, stores and office buildings. Consolidated Edison said that as of 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, 634,000 customers in New York City and Westchester County were without power. Con Edison, fearing damage to its electrical equipment, shut down power pre-emptively in sections of Lower Manhattan on Monday evening, and then, at 8:30 p.m., an unplanned failure, probably caused by flooding in substations, knocked out power to most of Manhattan below Midtown, about 250,000 customers. Later, an explosion at a Con Ed substation on East 14th Street knocked out power to another 250,000 customers. In New Jersey, more than two million customers were without power as of 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, and in Connecticut nearly 500,000. President Obama , who returned to the White House and met with top advisers, said Monday that the storm would disrupt the rhythms of daily life in the states it hit. “Transportation is going to be tied up for a long time,” he said, adding that besides flooding, there would probably be widespread power failures. He said utility companies had lined up crews to begin making repairs. But he cautioned that it could be slow going. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. “The fact is, a lot of these emergency crews are not going to get into position to start restoring power until some of these winds die down,” the president said. He added, “That may take several days.” Forecasters attributed the power of the storm to a convergence of weather systems. As the hurricane swirled north in the Atlantic and then pivoted toward land, a wintry storm was heading toward it from the west, and cold air was blowing south from the Arctic . The hurricane left more than 60 people dead in the Caribbean before it began crawling toward the Northeast. “The days ahead are going to be very difficult, Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland said. “There will be people who die and are killed in this storm,” he said. Alex Sosnowski, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, said potentially damaging winds would continue on Tuesday from Illinois to the Carolinas — and as far north as Maine — as the storm barreled toward the eastern Great Lakes. Mr. Cuomo, who ordered many of the most heavily used bridges and tunnels in New York City closed, warned that the surge from Hurricane Sandy could go two feet higher than that associated with Tropical Storm Irene last year. The PATH system, buses and the Staten Island Ferry system were also suspended. Mr. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has said he expected to restore at least some service about 12 hours after the storm ended. But possible flooding within the subway system could prevent a full-scale reopening. The storm headed toward land with weather that was episodic: a strong gust of wind one minute, then mist. More wind. Thin sheets of rain dancing down the street. Then, for a moment, nothing. The sky lightened. Then another blast of rain. Then more wind. The day brought a giddiness to schoolchildren who had the day off and to grown-ups who were fascinated by the rough, rising water. Some went surfing , discounting the danger. Felquin Piedra, 38, rode his Jet Ski from Queens to Lower Manhattan. “I love the waves,” Mr. Piedra yelled from New York Harbor. “The water is warm. I’ve jumped in several times.” But even when landfall was still hours away, there was no holding back the advance guard of the storm — fast-moving bands of rain and punishing winds. It added up to devastation. Driving through places like Pompton Plains, N.J., late Monday afternoon was like an X-Games contest for drivers. They had to do tree-limb slaloms on side streets and gunned their engines anxiously as they passed wind funnels of leaves swirling on highways. On City Island, off the Bronx mainland, Cheryl Brinker sprayed “Sandy Stay Away” on her boarded-up art studio, expanding a collage she started during Tropical Storm Irene last year. But by midafternoon, nearby Ditmars Street was under as much as five feet of water and Steve Van Wickler said the water had cracked the cement in his cellar. “It’s like a little river running in my basement,” he said. “There are cracks and leaks everywhere.” In some places, caravans of power-company trucks traveled largely empty roads; Public Service Electric and Gas said that 600 line workers and 526 tree workers had arrived from across the country, but could not start the repairs and cleanup until the wind had subsided, perhaps not until Wednesday. They will see a landscape that, in many places, was remade by the storm. In Montauk, at the end of Long Island , a 50-seat restaurant broke in half. Half of the building floated away and broke into pieces on the beach. The 110-foot-tall lighthouse at Montauk Point — the oldest in the state, opened in 1796 — shuddered in the storm despite walls that are six feet thick at the base. The lighthouse keeper, Marge Winski, said she had never felt anything like that in 26 years on the job. “I went up in tower and it was vibrating, it was shaking,” she said. “I got out of it real quick. I’ve been here through hurricanes, and nor’easters, but nothing this bad.” A version of this article appears in print on October 30, 2012, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: STORM PICKS UP SPEED AND DISRUPTS MILLIONS OF LIVES.

Five years after Sandy ravaged homes in New York and New Jersey, victims flocked to Capitol Hill Wednesday demanding changes in the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program they say made getting reimbursed for storm damage a nightmare. “It’s a little bit of PTSD,” Joanne Fogarty, president of the Rockaway Point homeowners Association in Breezy Point, told the Post. “I feel horrible for the people who are going through the floods and the storms… It’s knowing the fight with the flood insurance program that’s coming up for them.” She added: “The storm is the easy part.” Sandy storm victims recounted the harrowing stories of their flood insurance claims being denied, delayed and underpaid. Five years later, many said they still haven’t found relief because FEMA has grossly underestimated the amount of damage sustained and they’ve had to mount appeals and litigation for justice. Fogarty said residents in her neighborhood with flood insurance were offered payouts of as little as $20,000 for $250,000 worth of damage. Those who fought the federal government and refiled were rewarded with $70,000 payouts – better, but still not enough to be whole, she said. About a quarter of the 1,200 homes in her neighborhood still are waiting to be rebuilt. Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) said as Congress is focused, rightfully, on helping the victims of Harvey and Irma, he doesn’t’ want the ongoing struggles from Sandy to be forgotten. Lawmakers must also pass meaningful reforms to the national flood insurance programs so victims can get the money owed to them.
Myth-Conceptions: 5 Falsehoods about Superstorm Sandy During disasters, rumors, untruths and exaggerations swirl through the air along with the detritus of hurricane winds Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Stumble Upon Share via Print Credit: Christina Rutz via Flickr Advertisement Myth: Hurricanes induce labor Hurricane Sandy's potency came in part from the storm’s unusually low barometric pressure, which in theory could cause a pregnant woman’s amniotic sac to break—inducing labor. The claim isn't new (see this 1985 study in The Journal of Reproductive Medicine), but it is contentious. In 2007 a study in the Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics suggested that deliveries increase on days with a marked change in barometric pressure. A 2005 study in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, however, found no relationship between atmospheric pressure and birthrate. Although the jury may be out on whether hurricanes can induce labor, there are more obvious (and scientifically defensible) worries about hurricanes and pregnant women. Stress is a big one, so is dehydration. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a fact sheet on disaster preparedness for expectant mothers that touches on a few of these points. —Daisy Yuhas Myth: The full moon caused a dramatic rise in Sandy's storm surge The moon has a profound effect upon the world's oceans. Its gravitational tug pushes and pulls large bodies of water, and when the moon is full, it's also at a position in its monthly orbit to be at its strongest. So it was unlucky, then, that Sandy made landfall during a full moon—when the sun, moon and Earth align to produce the strongest gravitational effect on the tides. This combined force, aka spring tide (which also occurs during a new moon) altered tidal patterns, making high tides higher and adding to an already deadly storm surge. This isn't a myth, but it's also gotten quite a bit of unwarranted hype. The increase in water level was probably only a few centimeters—enough to make only a small difference compared with the magnitude of the tidal surge created by the storm. —Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato Myth: You should've kept your windows open during Sandy There's an urban legend that suggests keeping windows shut during a hurricane causes pressure to build up in a home until the building's roof pops off. By this logic, you should open your window just a tad to equalize pressure. It's true that as hurricanes move into an area, atmospheric pressure can plummet by nearly 10 percent, raising the relative indoor pressure. Such a sudden drop may cause problems. However, Bedient still takes issue with this advice. Opening your window may help equalize pressure, but allowing 145-kilometer-per-hour winds into your home presents other risks, and it isn't the best strategy. —Daisy Yuhas Myth: Birds usually don't survive big storms Birds are sometimes blown astray, but many apparently have a coping strategy. Hurricane Katrina destroyed the habitat of breeding colonies in Louisiana's Pearl River Basin, for instance, but bird numbers held steady, researchers noted in the journal Forest Ecology and Management. Some birds are especially adept: Scientists at the College of William & Mary Center for Conservation Biology tracked a migratory shorebird, a whimbrel, as it flew through Hurricane Irene in 2011. —Marissa Fessenden Myth: Sandy was a normal hurricane Hurricane Sandy had an asymmetrical wind field, which means its most powerful winds were located in its left-rear quadrant, making it anything but normal. Most storms of Sandy's caliber are strongest in the front, right quadrant. What's interesting about the storm is it underwent an extratropical transition during the storm, says Forrest Masters, a wind engineer at the University of Florida. "Sandy's a slightly different animal than we've been looking at in the past." This transformation made it difficult for Masters's team to track the storm as it headed toward their southern New Jersey base. It also means that when Sandy first made landfall, east coast residents only experienced partial wind load and might have misjudged the severity of the storm. —Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato Myth: Sandy hit the U.S. Northeast as a hurricane Perhaps the greatest myth of all is that Sandy was a hurricane for its entire journey up the U.S. eastern seaboard. There's no doubt that the storm packed a punch, but the National Hurricane Center downgraded it from hurricane to "tropical storm" on Monday, October 29. Why the switch? The center uses a sliding scale called Saffir–Simpson to categorize hurricanes. The scale is based solely on wind speed. So when Sandy's wind velocity decreased, the storm also lost its hurricane status. The lesser label presents a communications problem for scientists who study storm surges and for public officials who have to make evacuation decisions for entire populations because of flooding. The demotion from hurricane to tropical storm does not make the event any less deadly, says Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University. "We have plenty of examples of lower category storms that cause a greater level of damage and higher category storms that cause a lower level of damage," he says. The mismatch between a storm's status and the damage it can inflict is a consequence of a gradual increase in the size and intensity of storms overall, says Rice's Bedient. As storms grow larger and more intense, their impacts might have outgrown the Saffir–Simpson scale. "We're getting these really huge storms," he adds. "They can have enormous storm surge effects compared to what we saw back in the '50s and '60s." The meteorological community has proposed other ways of measuring hurricanes, but some researchers stand in staunch support of Saffir–Simpson.

Breed and Tom HaysAssociated Press Tues., Oct. 30, 2012 NEW YORK—The most devastating storm in decades to hit the most densely populated U.S. region cut off modern communication and left millions without power Tuesday, as thousands who fled their waterlogged homes wondered when — if — life would return to normal. A weakening Sandy, the hurricane turned fearsome superstorm, killed at least 50 people, many hit by falling trees, and still wasn’t finished. It inched inland across Pennsylvania, ready to bank toward western New York state to dump more of its water and likely cause more havoc Tuesday night. Behind it, a dazed, inundated New York City, a drenched Atlantic Coast and a moonscape of disarray and debris — from unmoored shore-town boardwalks to submerged mass-transit systems to delicate presidential politics. Rescue workers patrol a flooded street at Hoboken, New Jersey on Tuesday. Millions of people across the eastern United States awoke on Tuesday to scenes of destruction wrought by monster storm Sandy. ( EDUARDO MUNOZ / REUTERS ) “Nature,” said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, assessing the damage to his city, “is an awful lot more powerful than we are.” More than 8.2 million households were without power in 17 states as far west as Michigan. Nearly 2 million of those were in New York, where large swaths of lower Manhattan lost electricity and entire streets ended up under water — as did seven subway tunnels between Manhattan and Brooklyn at one point, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for a second day from weather, the first time that has happened since a blizzard in 1888. The city’s subway system, the lifeblood of more than 5 million residents, was damaged like never before and closed indefinitely, and Consolidated Edison said electricity in and around New York could take a week to restore. “Everybody knew it was coming. Unfortunately, it was everything they said it was,” said Sal Novello, a construction executive who rode out the storm with his wife, Lori, in the Long Island town of Lindenhurst, and ended up with 7 feet (2.1 metres) of water in the basement. The scope of the storm’s damage wasn’t known yet. Though early predictions of river flooding in Sandy’s inland path were petering out, colder temperatures made snow the main product of Sandy’s slow march from the sea. Parts of the West Virginia mountains were blanketed with 2 feet of snow by Tuesday afternoon, and drifts 4 feet deep were reported at Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina border in the South. With election day a week away, the storm also threatened to affect the presidential campaign. Federal disaster response, always a dicey political issue, has become even thornier since government mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005. And poll access and voter turnout, both of which hinge upon how people are impacted by the storm, could help shift the outcome in an extremely close race. As organized civilization came roaring back Tuesday in the form of emergency response, recharged mobile phones and the reassurance of daylight, harrowing stories emerged in the hours after Sandy’s howling winds and tidal surges shoved water over seaside barriers, into low-lying streets and up from coastal storm drains. By Tuesday afternoon, there were still only hints of the economic impact of the storm. Airports remained closed across the East Coast and far beyond as tens of thousands of travellers found they couldn’t get where they were going. Article Continued Below Forecasting firm IHS Global Insight predicted the storm will end up causing about $20 billion (all figures U.S.) in damages and $10 billion to $30 billion in lost business. Another firm, AIR Worldwide, estimated losses up to $15 billion — big numbers probably offset by reconstruction and repairs that will contribute to longer-term growth. Images from around the storm-affected areas depicted scenes reminiscent of big-budget disaster movies. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, a gaping hole remained where once a stretch of boardwalk sat by the sea. In Queens, New York, rubble from a fire that destroyed as many as 100 houses in an evacuated beachfront neighbourhood jutted into the air at ugly angles against a grey sky. In heavily flooded Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, dozens of yellow cabs sat parked in rows, submerged in murky water to their windshields. At the ground zero construction site in lower Manhattan, sea water rushed into a gaping hole under harsh floodlights. One of the most dramatic tales came from lower Manhattan, where a failed backup generator forced New York University’s Tisch Hospital to relocate more than 200 patients, including 20 babies from neonatal intensive care. Dozens of ambulances lined up in the rainy night and the tiny patients were gingerly moved out, some attached to battery-powered respirators as gusts of wind blew their blankets. Sandy killed 18 people in New York City, the mayor said. The dead included two who drowned in a home and one who was in bed when a tree fell on an apartment. A 23-year-old woman died after stepping into a puddle near a live electrical wire. In Moonachie, New Jersey, north of Manhattan, water rose to 5 feet (1.5 metres) within 45 minutes and trapped residents who thought the worst of the storm had passed. In a measure of its massive size, in the Midwest waves on southern Lake Michigan rose to a record-tying 20.3 feet or 6.1 metres. High winds spinning off Sandy’s edges clobbered the Cleveland area early Tuesday, uprooting trees, closing schools and flooding major roads along Lake Erie. Sandy began in the Atlantic and knocked around the Caribbean — killing nearly 70 people — and strengthened into a hurricane as it chugged across the southeastern coast of the United States. By Tuesday night it had ebbed in strength but was joining up with another, more wintry storm — an expected confluence of weather systems that earned it nicknames like “superstorm” and, on Halloween eve, “Frankenstorm.” It became, pretty much everyone agreed Tuesday, the weather event of a lifetime — and one shared vigorously on social media by people in Sandy’s path who took eye-popping photographs as the storm blew through, then shared them with the world by the blue light of their smartphones. On Twitter, Facebook and the photo-sharing service Instagram, people tried to connect, reassure relatives and make sense of what was happening — and, in many cases, work to authenticate reports of destruction and storm surges. They posted and passed around images and real-time updates at a dizzying rate, wishing each other well and gaping, virtually, at scenes of calamity moments after they unfolded. Among the top terms on Facebook through the night and well into Tuesday, according to the social network: “we are OK,” “made it” and “fine.” Atlantic City’s fabled Boardwalk, the oldest in the U.S., lost several blocks when Sandy came through, though the majority of it remained intact even as other Jersey Shore boardwalks were dismantled. What damage could be seen on the coastline Tuesday was, in some locations, staggering — “unthinkable,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said of what unfolded along the Jersey Shore, where houses were swept from their foundations and amusement park rides were washed into the ocean. “Beyond anything I thought I would ever see.” More from The Star & Partners LOADING Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

We're coming up on almost three weeks since Hurricane Sandy pummeled the city with storm surges and massive flooding, leaving behind widespread power outages, transit woes, housing destruction and more problems we're going to be dealing with for a long time to come. Below, a roundup of the latest Sandy-related news, from the freeloaders at Sandy donation centers to Rockaways sewage to Park Slope parking woes. There are still around 33 schools that remain severely damaged because of Sandy, and students in those schools have had their lives doubly-upended as a result: “We’re concerned,” said Jennifer Izzo, a guidance counselor at the Rockaway Park High School for Environmental Sustainability. “We still can’t find some of them.” According to NBC, strangers who weren't affected by Sandy and don't even live near devastated areas have been turning up at donation centers taking advantage of their goodwill: "People are trying to abuse this." Homeowners who have been having trouble getting help from insurers and the feds can now get free legal advice at Brooklyn Borough Hall from a group of volunteer lawyers.

Commuters ride the F train Nov. 1, 2012 in New York City. Limited public transit has returned to New York. With the death toll continuing to rise and millions of homes and businesses without power, the U.S. east coast is attempting to recover from the effects of floods, fires and power outages brought on by Superstorm Sandy. Superstorm Sandy slammed into the New Jersey coastline late Monday, Oct. 29, hurling seawater at cities and towns along the eastern seaboard. In New York City, storm surge flooded tunnels, subway stations and parts of the city’s electrical system. Sandy left at least 50 people dead in her wake in North America, and has put an estimated 8.2 million households without power in 17 states, according to the Associated Press.
Contents The concert was an effort of NBC and its affiliated channels, and its origins lay with Today show anchor Matt Lauer suggesting it to NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke.[1] It featured appearances and musical performances mostly by those associated with the affected areas, especially New Jersey and New York.[2][3] At least one, Long Island's Billy Joel, had properties damaged by the storm.[4] Organization for the production was put together in a hurry, in the face of logistical and transportation difficulties in the wake of the storm.[4] Some of the musical acts made their own remarks before their songs, including Aguilera, who opened the show by stating that she was born in Staten Island.[3] Performances were generally stripped-down arrangements of old songs that either reflected feelings of distress or expressed sympathy and offered hope and encouragement;[2]Rolling Stone wrote that the songs "sometimes seemed written for the occasion".[3] In addition, Joel and Blige both modified their songs' lyrics to fit what had taken place.[2] Some microphone failures marked the group rendition of "Under the Boardwalk", the main lead vocal for which was given to Fallon, inspiring a bit of jocularity in the otherwise somber program.[2]
Tidal gauge at The Battery showing the storm surge (green) lining up perfectly with the high tide (blue) to produce a massive storm tide (red) – National Data Buoy Center, NOAA. Also note that pressure bottomed out just above 960mb. A site at Sandy Hook, NJ stopped reporting before the peak storm surge/tide. Heavy rain combined with the storm tide on the Chesapeake and Delaware bays caused flooding in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The storm tide travelled up the Hudson river leading to record levels at Poughkeepsie. Rivers are still rising in response to the heavy rains from the storm still flowing into them. Heavy snow and (near) blizzard conditions are occurring the central Appalachian mountains and Ohio. Storm conditions are still occurring on the Great Lakes leading to very rough lake conditions and coastal flooding where onshore winds are producing 1-3ft water level rises. Damages from this hurricane will likely be astronomical in expense, mainly from the coastal flooding and power outages. In these coastal areas, many trees still had their leaves and so tree damage, power outages, and damage to homes from falling trees was the primary form of wind damage. Tree damage, power line damage, and roof damage from the weight of the snow, which was of a high water content, were the most common form of damage where feet of snow have fallen in the mountains. Meteorologically, this storm was significant because of its rare form of interaction with an extra-tropical system, its trajectory, its record breaking low landfall pressure of 946mb, and its size. A storm like this has immense potential to cause death and destruction and that it has indeed lived up to its potential. The name Sandy will likely be retired. Hurricane Sandy at landfall in Cuba around 1:30am Eastern Time October 25th. GOES imagery. Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba around 1:30am this morning. According to the National Hurricane Center, Sandy had 110mph winds and a minimum central pressure near 957mb at landfall. The storm came ashore just to the west of the city of Santiago de Cuba where sustained winds of 78mph gusting to 114mph with a pressure of 960mb was reported before the station stopped reporting so conditions were likely worse than this at the height of the storm. A storm surge between 4 and 7 feet likely occurred near this city. Yesterday evening, Sandy exited the coast of Jamaica and underwent rapid intensification where the central pressure fell from 970mb to 954mb in six hours before its Cuba landfall. Sandy has since emerged from Cuba and has weakened slightly to a 100mph, 967mb storm. Some re-strengthening is already occurring as the storm heads northwards in an area that appears to be favorable for tropical cyclone development. The Bahamas are going to get the worst of Sandy today as this dangerous storm moves through the islands into the West Atlantic. As of 11am, Sandy had 105mph sustained winds and a minimum central pressure of 964mb. Forecast track… Sandy is expected to move northwards through the central Bahamas today and northwestwards into Northwestern Bahamas this evening, nearing the Florida coast in response to an approaching trough over the central US. From there, Sandy should be turned back towards the north-northeast as the trough starts to move off the East coast of the US, without a Florida landfall, and start to move into the Western Atlantic near the US East coast. On Sunday, Sandy is expected to turn back to the north and approach New England as it gets absorbed into/absorbs the trough over the Northeastern States. What to expect… Caribbean: Tropical storm conditions are starting to subside in Cuba and Haiti so warnings have been discontinued there, but heavy rain lingers in Haiti and the Dominican Republic where total rainfall accumulations are expected to be 12-18inches with isolated areas of 20inches in the mountains – life threatening flash flooding and mudslides may result, especially on Hispaniola. Bahamas: Hurricane conditions will be occurring in some of the islands of the central and northwestern Bahamas today and into tomorrow morning as Sandy moves through the island chain, Hurricane Warnings are in effect there. Storm surges up to 8 feet are possible in the Bahamas where onshore eyewall winds occur. Heavy rain of 3-6 inches is expected to cause some localized flooding in combination with storm surges. Florida: Late tonight and on Friday, tropical storm conditions may occur on the east coast of Florida where Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings are in effect from the Florida Keys to north of Melbourne. Up to three inches of rain are possible in Florida from the squally outer bands of Sandy. Some modest sea level rises and extremely rough surf will cause extensive beach erosion and very dangerous rip currents as the storm passes. Bermuda: Sandy may be large enough and head far enough eastwards to bring strong or even tropical storm force winds to Bermuda this weekend and into early next week along with some squally showers and very rough surf. New England: Early next week, after the Sandy moves away from the Bahamas, Florida, and Bermuda, it is expected to take aim on New England as it merges into a stalled trough that is expected to set up there. This is after day five in the forecast, so there is a very high degree of uncertainty in this track, but even more so because this situation is so delicate that any slight change in the trajectory after day five will send the storm into a different area of the coast. Regardless, expect a very severe Ocean Storm that may be comparable to the Perfect Storm in 1991, except expect Sandy to move inland and bring coastal flooding, tropical storm or hurricane force winds, heavy flooding rain, and as cold air from Canada associated with the trough moves in, some snow in the interior Northeast, especially in the Mountains.
Hurricane Sandy on verge of New Jersey landfall NEW YORK/REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware (Reuters) - Hurricane Sandy, one of the biggest storms ever to hit the United States, lashed the densely populated East Coast on Monday, shutting down transportation, forcing evacuations in flood-prone areas and interrupting the presidential campaign. Fierce winds and flooding racked hundreds of miles of Atlantic coastline and heavy snows were forecast farther inland at higher elevations as the center of the storm moves ashore along the coast of southern New Jersey or Delaware on Monday evening. U.S. stock markets were closed for the first time since the attacks of September 11, 2001, and will remain shut on Tuesday. The federal government in Washington was closed and schools were shut up and down the East Coast. The storm’s target area included big population centers such as New York City, Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. More than a million customers already were without power by early evening and millions more could lose electricity. One disaster forecasting company predicted economic losses could ultimately reach $20 billion, only half of it insured. In Washington, President Barack Obama appealed to the tens of millions of people in the hurricane’s path to follow directions given to them by authorities. Related Coverage “If the public’s not following instructions, that makes it more dangerous for people, and it means that we could have fatalities that could have been avoided,” Obama said at the White House, adding that people should expect long power outages and idled transportation systems. New York City evacuated neighbors of a 90-story super luxury apartment building under construction after its crane partially collapsed in high winds, prompting fears the entire rig could crash to the ground. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN INTERRUPTED The storm interrupted the U.S. presidential campaign with eight days to go before the election, as President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney canceled events. Both men acted cautiously to avoid coming across as overtly political while millions of people are imperiled by the storm ahead of the November 6 election. New York and other cities closed their transit systems and schools, ordering mass evacuations from low-lying areas ahead of a storm surge that could reach as high as 11 feet. Sandy was moving quickly toward New Jersey and Delaware. At 5 p.m. (2100 GMT), the hurricane was 30 miles east-southeast of Cape May, New Jersey, and about 40 miles south of Atlantic City, New Jersey, the National Hurricane Center said. Sandy picked up speed as it raced northwest toward the U.S. coast at 28 miles per hour (45 km per hour), with top sustained winds at 90 mph, it said. Forecasters said Sandy was a rare, hybrid “super storm” created by an Arctic jet stream wrapping itself around a tropical storm. Storm surf kicked up by the high winds from Hurricane Sandy floods through a home in Southampton, New York October 29, 2012. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson The combination of those two storms would have been bad enough, but meteorologists said there was a third storm at play - a system coming down from Canada that would effectively trap the hurricane-nor’easter combo and hold it in place. Moreover, the storm was coming ashore at high tide, which was pulled even higher by a full moon. While Sandy does not have the intensity of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, it has been gathering strength. It killed 66 people in the Caribbean last week before pounding U.S. coastal areas as it moved north. An AccuWeather meteorologist said Sandy “is unfolding as the Northeast’s Katrina.” Forecasters said Sandy could be the largest storm to hit the mainland in U.S. history. Off North Carolina, the U.S. Coast Guard rescued 14 of the 16 crew members who abandoned the replica tall ship HMS Bounty, using helicopters to lift them from life rafts. The Coast Guard continued to search for two missing crew members, including the captain. Joe Connelly, 52, a trucker from the Bronx, was leaving the City Island Marina after checking on his two motor boats. He said he watched the water from the first storm-driven high tide swamp a nearby dock. Slideshow (32 Images) “We were concerned that the whole dock was going to float away and out to sea,” he said. “It had about four feet to go before that happened.” All U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday and will remain shut on Tuesday, with a plan to re-open on Wednesday that depends on conditions after the storm passes.
Tag: Sandy Flooding East Coast view of Hurricane Sandy, GOES Imagery from NOAA. October 27th 2012. Sandy has become so large that typical floater imagery doesn’t capture the entire storm. As of 11am eastern from the National Hurricane Center: Maximum sustained winds are near 75mph Minimum central pressure is near 958mb Sandy is moving North-Northeast at about 9mph. Sandy is doing a balancing act north of the Bahamas where it is trying to deepen (lower its central pressure) and expand its wind field at the same time. Fluctuations in its maximum wind speeds have been the result, and Sandy will likely continue to be at borderline hurricane status until Sunday night when it will try to strengthen as it gets energized by its merger with the trough over the interior Eastern United States. Hurricane Sandy’s pressure fell from 969mb at 11pm last night to 958mb at 11am this morning indicating deepening. While its maximum radius of tropical storm force winds expanded from 275miles at 5pm yesterday, to 450miles at 5am this morning. All Hurricane Warnings have been discontinued for now, but tropical storm conditions are still occurring in the northernmost Bahamas, offshore of Florida and North and South Carolina where tropical storm warnings are in effect. Further advisories, watches, and warnings will be needed as Sandy approaches, potentially from North Carolina to Maine. East coast states have already declared states of emergency and some evacuation notices have been posted in advance of Sandy’s landfall which is forecast to be somewhere in New Jersey or the Delmarva peninsula. Official National Hurricane Center track for Hurricane Sandy as of 11am Eastern Time. Tropical Storm Warnings for parts of North and South Carolina and the Bahamas in blue, and Tropical Storm Watches in yellow for parts of South Carolina and Bermuda. Impacts…Heavy flooding rain over 6″ in areas is likely near the storm’s path. Areas where both storm surge and flooding rains are a threat may have the flooding exacerbated by the unusually high tides down stream. Heavy wet snow is a distinct possibility in the higher elevations of Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Significant coastal flooding is also likely in areas of onshore winds and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where storm surges are forecast to reach up to 8feet and storm tides may be extreme due to the large changes between low and high tide and the astronomical high tide with the full moon on Monday. Damaging winds (30-60mph) could extend far inland causing tree damage and potentially some power outages. Structurally damaging winds (50-75mph) could occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland. Keep in mind that tropical storm force winds (sustained at >39mph) have been observed more than 400miles from the center of this storm – so even though the storm may make landfall in New Jersey, areas as far north as Maine and as far inland as Ontario and Quebec (including Lakes Erie and Ontario) could see tropical storm conditions. Areas to the south will have offshore winds, and tropical storm force winds will extend less far from the center and will be gustier in nature. In these areas, hazardously low water levels may be observed, especially at low tide. Meanwhile, there could be a period of tropical storm conditions in Bermuda (Tropical Storm Watch) sometime between tonight and Monday night as Sandy continues to expand and passes to the distant west. Squally showers will be the theme here during that period.

Read More Aerial Pictures Show Hurricane Sandy’s Destruction By Andrew Freedman Published: November 9th, 2012 , Last Updated: November 9th, 2012 Hurricane Sandy was one of the most destructive storms to ever strike the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. It brought a record storm surge that flattened parts of the New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut coastlines, flooded parts of New York City, and caused an estimated $50 billion or more in damage. The storm's battering waves helped reshape the coastline, forming breaches in the land and destroying homes and businesses. Aerial photography by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) shows the extent of the coastal changes before and after the storm. "Sandy taught us yet again that not all Cat-1 hurricanes are created equal: the superstorm's enormous fetch over the Atlantic produced storm surge and wave erosion of historic proportions," said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. "We have seized this opportunity to gather unique data on a major coastline-altering event." Storm waves and surge cut across the barrier island at Mantoloking, NJ, eroding a wide beach, destroying houses and roads, and depositing sand onto the island and into the back-bay.

The USGS worked with the National Park Service to examine the storm's impacts on Fire Island National Seashore on Long Island. “We found that there was widespread dune erosion and overwash,” said St. Petersburg-based USGS coastal geologist Cheryl Hapke. “On average the dunes eroded back 70 feet - the equivalent of 30 years of change, which had previously been measured. Our data also showed that dunes lost as much as 10 feet of elevation.”

NY lawmakers call House GOP plans to adjourn Congress without vote on Sandy aid a 'betrayal' Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., left, joined by other New York area-lawmakers affected by Superstorm Sandy, express their anger and disappointment after learning the House Republican leadership decided to allow the current term of Congress to end without holding a vote on aid for the storm's victims, at the Capitol in Washington, early Wednesday, Jan. 2, 2013. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON – New York lawmakers from both parties on Wednesday lashed out at the decision by House GOP leaders not to hold a vote on Hurricane Sandy aid in the current Congress, calling it a "betrayal." Reps. Michael Grimm, a Republican, and Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, said in angry House floor remarks that while they did not agree on much, House Speaker John Boehner's decision would be a crushing blow to states battered by the late October storm. "There was a betrayal," said Grimm. The Senate approved a $60.4 billion measure Friday to help with recovery from the storm that devastated parts of New York, New Jersey and nearby states. The House Appropriations Committee has drafted a smaller, $27 billion measure, and a vote had been expected before Congress' term ends Thursday at noon. An amendment for $33 billion in additional aid, partly to protect against future storms, was also being considered. Grimm and Nadler were among several New York and New Jersey lawmakers who took to the House floor to complain about Boehner's move. The lawmakers said Boehner pulled the bill without talking to them. "It's the most disgraceful action I've seen in this House," said Nadler. "It is a betrayal by the speaker personally of the members of this House," Nadler said. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., called it a "cruel knife in the back" to New and New Jersey. He said some Republicans have a double standard when it comes to providing aid to New York and New Jersey compared with other regions of the country suffering disasters. Somehow, he said, money going to New York and New Jersey is seen as "corrupt." He said those same Republicans have no trouble coming to New York and New Jersey to raise millions of dollars. King urged donors from the two states not to give money to Republicans who are ignoring their needs on Sandy. King said Congress approved $60 billion for Hurricane Katrina in 2005 within 10 days, but hasn't appropriated any money for Sandy in over two months. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., blamed tea party lawmakers and conservatives who were reluctant to approve new spending soon after the debate over the "fiscal cliff" budget issues for the sudden move by GOP leaders. He said the move was "deplorable." New York and New Jersey lawmakers said they believed they had support for both measures. "I am convinced it would have passed," said Rep. Frank LoBiiondo, R-N.J., who represents Atlantic City which was hard hit LoBiondo said New York and New Jersey lawmakers have backed past disaster aid bills for other states. "Now when it comes to us, we have a lot of hemming and hawing," LoBiondo said. The lawmakers had erupted in anger late Tuesday night after learning the House Republican leadership decided to allow the current term of Congress to end without holding a vote on aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy. King said Tuesday night he was told by the office of Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia that Boehner had decided to abandon a vote this session. Cantor, who sets the House schedule, did not immediately comment. New York and New Jersey GOP lawmakers were hoping to meet with Cantor and Boehner on Wednesday. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland told reporters that just before Tuesday evening's vote on "fiscal cliff" legislation, Cantor told him that he was "99.9 percent confident that this bill would be on the floor, and that's what he wanted." A spokesman for Boehner, Michael Steel on Wednesday would not say whether Boehner would reconsider his decision on Sandy aid, responding with the same statement he issued on Tuesday night: "The speaker is committed to getting this bill passed this month." More than $2 billion in federal funds has been spent so far on relief efforts for 11 states and the District of Columbia struck by the storm, one of the worst ever to hit the Northeast. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund still has about $4.3 billion, enough to pay for recovery efforts into early spring, according to officials. The unspent FEMA money can only be used for emergency services, said Pallone. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Hampshire, Delaware, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are receiving federal aid. Sandy was blamed for at least 120 deaths and battered coastline areas from North Carolina to Maine. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were the hardest hit states and suffered high winds, flooding and storm surges. The storm damaged or destroyed more than 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey. In New York, 305,000 housing units were damaged or destroyed and more than 265,000 businesses were affected.
More than two weeks after Hurricane Sandy, now that its floodwaters have receded and the region's utilities and transportation systems have largely been restored, researchers and authorities are beginning to look at Sandy's other effects. "We tend to think of events like Sandy in terms of the ephemeral effect of the wind, rain, waves and even snow as it swept through our communities, but in fact this superstorm can have a longer-term effect in the large pulse of sediment and associated pollutants swept into our waterways," Marcia McNutt, U.S. Geological Survey director, said in a statement. Damage from Hurricane Sandy took several wastewater treatment plants offline in New Jersey, and raw sewage carrying high levels of bacteria and viruses emptied into some waterways in the northern part of the state. Scientists estimate millions of gallons of sewage were spewed into New Jersey's rivers, streams and estuaries. "Plumes of freshwater carrying a lot of sediment typically have a murky, tan color," said Josh Kohut, an oceanographer at Rutgers University. "The plume contrasts with the much bluer ocean water, and you can see it from space." Kohut is part of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, which has been using satellite imagery to track the aftereffects of Hurricane Sandy. They can't directly spot sewage in the images, but they can see freshwater plumes that are most likely carrying sewage, sediments and other pollutants. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Geological Survey will use this and other data to determine which areas they should monitor closely for pollutants. Tracking freshwater plumes post-Sandy was challenging because the region was extremely cloudy for several days, which made clear satellite images hard to come by, Kohut said. But the images they did obtain told a somewhat optimistic story. Sewage overflows aside, Sandy doesn't appear to have dumped much more sediment and pollution into the waterways than a typical rainstorm would, he said. Instead of a large plume entering New York Harbor, the team spotted more localized plumes from smaller inlets such as the Manasquan Inlet and Barnegat Bay, both off the coast of New Jersey. "Irene last year, Ernesto in 2006 and Floyd in 1999 were all major, major rain events for New York and New Jersey. Following each of those, you saw a big pulse from rivers into the ocean," Kohut told OurAmazingPlanet. "Sandy was less a rain event and more of a wind and surge event."

Read More Sandy Brings Flurry of Attention to Climate Change Published: November 1st, 2012 By Climate Central As the flood waters from Hurricane Sandy have receded to reveal the extent of the storm’s damage - from the devastated coastline in New Jersey to the power outages that stretch as far west as Ohio - people are beginning to ask: can this storm be attributed to climate change? Since Monday, hundreds of news stories and blog posts across the country, and across the spectrum of media, have been published asking just that question. Some of the best and most visible of those are collected here, to help guide you through this emerging debate. Credit: NASA The general consensus among climate scientists -- and this has been covered by Climate Central and many others -- is that absent rigorous attribution research, which can take many months or years, we don't know exactly how strong the link is between a storm like Sandy and climate change. Not yet, anyway. Some of the superstorm’s impact came from a combination of factors that had nothing to do with climate change, such as the full moon that heightened high tides and exacerbated coastal flooding. National Geographic summed up those non-climatic factors well, in a piece written before the storm made landfall in New Jersey). However, there were a number of factors that made Sandy’s impact worse and that can be linked to climate change. Those include sea level rise, an increase in ocean temperatures, and the odd weather patterns that steered the storm into the east coast. That weather pattern may be tied to the diminishing Arctic sea ice, although that research is still emerging. See coverage in the Associated Press and the New York Times for the scientific debate surrounding how much each of these factors contributed to the damage caused by Sandy. A longer, more technical discussion can be found on the New York Times Green Blog and on the Dot Earth blog. If you walk past newsstands this week it will be hard to ignore Bloomberg Businessweek’s cover, which states in no uncertain terms, “It’s Global Warming, Stupid”. (Businessweek editor Josh Tyrangiel commented on Twitter that the cover “may generate controversy, but only among the stupid.”) Credit: BusinessWeek Looking past the less-than-subtle headline, the article takes a nuanced approach to explaining how the role of global warming is not one of direct causation. Eric Pooley of the Environmental Defense Fund, as quoted in the article, draws a parallel between Barry Bonds taking steroids and hitting a single home run. As he puts it, “We now have weather on steroids.” Finally, columnists, bloggers and politicians have not missed this sudden flurry of attention paid to climate change, after the subject was completely ignored during all three of the presidential debates. Here are a few noteworthy news stories, blog posts and op-eds that attempt to place climate change in the context of the national discussion. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg surprised many by officially endorsing Barack Obama for president on Thursday. Saying that Hurricane Sandy “had reshaped his thinking,” Bloomberg said he felt “Obama was the best candidate to tackle the global climate change that the mayor believes contributed to the violent storm” that has paralyzed his city. In their press conferences following the storm, both Bloomberg and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo referenced climate change as a possible culprit in the devastation. A New York Times editorial called for a broader discussion of climate change. The Guardian highlights figures, including Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who have called for the two presidential candidates to bring climate change back into the national discussion, after a campaign that has largely avoided the issue. They also have a piece that focuses more on Obama’s climate policies. Linguist George Lakoff at the Huffington Post released this blog post on Tuesday. While he exaggerates some of the purported impacts of global warming (“If we hit 2.0 Celsius... the earth -- and the living things on it -- will not recover.”), he makes a novel point about the semantics of debating climate change, and argues that we move past the simplistic cause-and-effect point of view.

7 comments: Derek: That is not how I read it. In fact he says, "NHC warnings (meaning hurricane and tropical storm) are taken more seriously." That would imply they are continuing with the existing warning suite from NHC. The Public Advisory out of NHC only mentions the Delmarva Peninsula at this time. You have to search elsewhere for the type of information we're seeing on this blog. Unless the general public is watching local media, I doubt they will realize how serious the situation actually is, which means the preparedness clock it ticking away and we're burning through precious time. Excellent information you conveyed, btw Mike. Thank you. I especially liked the advice to VOTE NOW. The election will not be postponed because of Hurricane Sandy.

Read More From Storm Surge to Snow, Hurricane Sandy Has It All By Andrew Freedman Published: October 28th, 2012 , Last Updated: October 28th, 2012 Hurricane Sandy is soon to make its feared turn toward the northwest, toward the Mid-Atlantic coastline, where it threatens to bring a record storm surge to New York City. Here are some of the latest developments as of Sunday evening, as storm preparations are being rushed to completion. We'll be updating this Storify through Sunday night as new storm projections and warnings are issued. Mid-Atlantic, Northeast Brace for Sandy Hurricane Sandy could cause a record storm surge in New York City, according to computer model projections on Sunday. The storm also is poised to unleash a wide swath of hurricane force winds from the Chesapeake Bay to Cape Cod, along with heavy rain and inland flooding. Storified by · Sun, Oct 28 2012 17:02:55 Hurricane Sandy is likely to deal a punishing blow to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and its impacts will be felt well inland as well. In fact, a blizzard warning has been issued for parts of West Virginia and Virginia, where colder air wrapping into the storm could turn heavy rain to heavy snow, with major accumulations likely. The New York City office of the National Weather Service is forecasting 6- to 11-foot water levels (that's the height of water above ground level, including the storm surge + the tide) for New York City and Long Island Sound. They are also warning of the potential for the surge in New York City to break the all-time record of 10.5 feet set in 1950 during Hurricane Donna.

Hurricane Joaquin is the sort of high uncertainty and high impact extreme weather event that the meteorology community has been preparing for since Hurricane Sandy's historic and deadly hit on the Mid-Atlantic states in 2012. Joaquin, which was a Category 1 hurricane as of early afternoon on Wednesday, is forecast to become a major hurricane, which means it would reach Category 3 intensity or greater, before it begins barreling its way up the East Coast toward the end of the week. Exactly where it goes is a giant question mark right now, though it is helping to aim a firehose of moisture at the East Coast, presenting the near-certainty of dangerous amounts of heavy rain during the next several days. The task of communicating these threats, from the more certain hazards (heavy rain) to the less clear ones (hurricane-force winds and storm surge flooding) falls to meteorologists and climate and weather reporters, including yours truly. Many of these experts have been trying to learn from their experience during Hurricane Sandy while dealing with a rapidly changing media landscape, where storms are not just hyped on cable news, but also on Twitter and Facebook. Trying to temper the hype and alarm but my concern level on #Joaquin rising...Sandy comparisons inevitable but be cautious. Since Sandy, there has been much soul-searching and studying going on in the meteorology and social sciences communities about risk communication. There were many mistakes made during Sandy, many forecasters concluded, including the lack of specific storm surge warnings that were separate from hurricane warnings, as well as the effect that switching the designation of the storm from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm may have had on the perceived threat among the public and emergency officials. Maria LaRosa, a meteorologist at the Weather Channel, told Mashable that her task right now is to communicate to viewers that they need to pay attention to this forecast while also communicating the uncertainty involved at this point. "There's been so much discussion recently (a very good thing) about communicating uncertainty when forecasting," she wrote via a Twitter message. "The message for Joaquin this many days out needs to illustrate that uncertainty without causing people to tune out the forecast. Leave room to elevate the strength of the wording." "For instance, I just texted my family in N.J. a snapshot of Joaquin's track and said, "OK, here's what I suggest you do now, this many days out." When it's time to pull the trigger, say in few days when things are more certain, I'll be saying things like, "OK, here's what you NEED to do NOW." Nate Johnson, a meteorologist and executive producer at WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, told Mashable via Twitter that the proliferation of social media presents a challenge for forecasters. "We’re still learning how to communicate complex, multi-hazard weather systems like hurricanes (and predecessor rainfall events) across different media or even different forms of social media. And the result can be unintentionally confusing or misleading for people who only get a bite-sized piece of what we might intend to be a meal," Johnson wrote. "Just like we can’t reduce a storm to a single category number, for example, we can’t reduce a hurricane down to a single tweet without cutting something out." Johnson said he is emphasizing two key points for his viewers and readers, which is the likelihood of heavy rain regardless of the track of Hurricane Joaquin. "We need to make sure we’re communicating well for the individual platform, and not just with an eye toward being first or getting the most shares but leaving people with a better understanding of what we think is going to happen." As for the hurricane itself, Johnson is trying to "synthesize and contextualize" the projections from computer models. "... We’ll look not just to put data out there but to synthesize & contextualize it… all within the frame of what people need to be thinking about or doing today, something for which I don’t need a perfect forecast to do," he wrote. "When tomorrow comes, the forecast data, models, and so forth will all be different… and so too will what people need to be thinking about and doing. In essence, we’re trying to keep the forecast and preparedness thoughts in sync and not forcing the forecast precision beyond what’s either available scientifically or what’s needed for most folks to be ready for whatever will come." Johnson, LaRosa and Marshall Shepherd, a meteorology professor at the University of Georgia and the former president of the American Meteorological Society, each told Mashable of their concerns regarding the potential for inland flooding to be the biggest story of this weather event. As Shepherd pointed out, focusing too much on the hurricane threat "may cause many to miss one of the real threats of this event. The significant amounts of rainfall that will fall on one of the most urbanized regions of the country and nearby mountainous regions too." The National Weather Service is forecasting a huge swath of five-to-ten-inch rainfall amounts during the next several days. This area, forecasts show, could encompass more than 1500 miles in north-south distance and 700 miles in width, from west to east. Seven-day rainfall forecast starting at 8 AM ET Wednesday. Image: National Weather Service Shepherd also says the comparisons to Hurricane Sandy, which was a storm that made a sudden left turn into the Mid-Atlantic, "are fair given the large-scale set up," be he noted key differences. "Sandy was a much larger storm footprint wise and was relatively weak. This storm may actually be a smaller storm area-wise, but pack more of a punch, intensity wise," he wrote. "This, coupled with the already startling moisture availability makes for a set of impacts likely different than Sandy." Studies have shown that inland flooding kills more people than any other hurricane-related hazard, Shepherd noted. In New Jersey and along much of the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern coast, strong winds and heavy rain will occur prior to any effects from Hurricane Joaquin. This is because of the combination of weather systems moving across the area, from a strong high pressure area over Quebec to a frontal boundary draped along the East Coast. Gary Szatkowski, who has been lauded for his risk communication efforts during Hurricane Sandy, said he is concerned the focus of attention in his region is being misdirected toward the hurricane threat. "We have a Coastal Flood Watch anda High Wind Watch up for high impact weather Friday into Saturday, associated with very strong northeast flow, all independent of #Joaquin," he wrote via Twitter. "[I'm concerned that focus has been on Joaquin, and that people will be 'surprised' even though ut has been in the forecast. If #Joaquin does threaten our area, these antecedent conditions will make preparedness activities very problematic." Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Hurricane Sandy: Five Reasons it's a Superstorm Hurricane Sandy has already caused much destruction and dozens of deaths in the Caribbean. (GET PHOTOS OF NEW YORK CITY FLOODING HERE) Here are five reasons Hurricane Sandy is considered a "Superstorm." 1. A NORTHBOUND HURRICANE Hurricane Sandy is moving slowly northeast but is expected to turn to the north and west today, forecasters say. At some point, it’s expected to become what’s known as an extratropical storm. Unlike a hurricane, which gets its power from warm ocean waters, extratropical systems are driven by temperature contrasts in the atmosphere. Although Sandy is a hurricane, it’s important not to focus too much on its official category or its precise path (current models show it making landfall over New Jersey or Delaware sometime late Monday or early Tuesday). Louis Uccellini (LOO’-ee yoo-cheh-LEE’-nee), environmental prediction chief for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press that given Sandy’s east-to-west track into New Jersey, the worst of the storm surge could be just to the north, in New York City, on Long Island and in northern New Jersey. Boston and Philadelphia should expect the worst storm conditions this afternoon into Tuesday morning. It’s a massive system that will affect a huge swath of the eastern U.S., regardless of exactly where it hits or its precise wind speed. For example, tropical storm-force winds can be felt more than 500 miles from the storm’s center, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s already caused some minor flooding in North Carolina’s Outer Banks and has prompted evacuations elsewhere. Federal Emergency Management Agency director Craig Fugate says his agency has personnel and supplies spread as far west as the Ohio River Valley. 2. EARLY WINTER STORM Sandy is expected to merge with a wintry system from the west, at which point it will become the powerful superstorm that has forecasters and officials across the eastern U.S. Winds from that system will pull Sandy back toward the U.S. mainland. 3. ARCTIC AIR FROM THE NORTH Frigid air coming south from Canada also is expected to collide with Sandy and the wintry storm from the west, creating a megastorm that is expected to park over the northeast for days. The brunt of the storm could hit areas farther inland. Officials are bracing for the worst: nearly a foot of rain, high winds and up to 2 feet of snow. 4. HIGH TIDES COULD WORSEN FLOODING Further complicating matters is the possibility for dangerous storm surges: A full moon means the tides will be higher than usual, which will make it easier for the storm’s powerful winds to push water into low-lying areas. That, coupled with the threat of several inches of rain, has officials working to shore up flood defenses. Storm surge could reach anywhere from 2 to 11 feet along the northeastern coast, forecasters say. Inland river flooding also is a serious concern. 5. COMBO OF SNOW, WIND INCREASES RISK FOR WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES Storms in recent years have left hundreds of thousands of people in the eastern U.S. without power, sometimes for days at a time. Utilities have been bringing in extra crews and lining up tree trimmers so they’re prepared, and with good reason. The superstorm brings two possibilities for knocking out electricity. For one, hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph could send tree branches into power lines, or even topple entire trees and power poles. Those left standing could succumb to snow, which could weigh down still-leafy branches enough to also topple trees.
Sandy becomes a Hurricane Hurricane Sandy on the southern coast of Jamaica. An eye is apparent on this RGB visible satellite image from NOAA’s GOES imager. Hurricane conditions could commence soon in Jamaica. Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Sandy this morning found that the storm has quickly strengthened into a category one hurricane with 80mph winds and 973mb central pressure. Some slight strengthening is possible just before a landfall occurs in Jamaica today where Hurricane Warnings are in effect. Heavy rains along with near tropical storm conditions are already occurring in coastal Jamaica; a gust to 51mph was recently observed in Kingston, Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center’s map of Tropical Storm and Hurricane advisories as of 11am Eastern. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for: * Haiti * The Central and Northwestern Bahamas A Hurricane Watch is in effect for: * The Central and Northwestern Bahamas A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for: * The Southeastern Bahamas * Florida East coast from the Volusia/Brevard county line to Ocean Reef, FL * Upper Florida Keys from Ocean Reef south to Craig Key, FL and Florida Bay Heavy rain of between 6 and 12 inches could trigger flash flooding and mudslides which will likely be the biggest threat to life in the Caribbean as Sandy exits to the north. Outer spiral bands extend far to the east of the storm and will likely produce heavy rains into Haiti and the Dominican Republic along with a chance for tornadoes and squally weather. Sandy is expected to continue northwards and make a second landfall in Eastern Cuba as a slightly weaker hurricane. But thereafter, Sandy is expected to begin to interact with a trough over the US East Coast and the forecast becomes increasingly uncertain. We are still unsure of how Sandy will interact with the trough, but it is looking increasingly like Sandy will become a powerful post-tropical storm that moves ashore somewhere from the Mid-Atlantic to Atlantic Canada that will cause severe impacts along the coast. This solution may involve the mixture of a tropical air mass and a polar air mass that could result in a heavy snow event for the interior Northeast. Depending on how far east Sandy goes, and how big the storm gets, Bermuda may see some strong winds- this solution is looking less likely today. Remember, the forecast after three days is still very uncertain but impacts to the US are becoming more likely according to the pattern that is unfolding. To make these forecasts more accurate, more weather balloons are being launched in the US, and hurricane hunters will continue to investigate the storm.
Hurricane Sandy: Remembering the historic storm and its aftermath By ROSANNE SALVATORE AND KATHRYN KATTALIA Oct 25, 2017 | 5:13 PM Hurricane Sandy struck with a vengeance on Oct. 29, 2012, causing unprecedented destruction as 80 mph winds and record storm surges wreaked havoc across the East Coast. As the city observes the 4th anniversary, take a look back the destruction caused by the biggest storm to ever hit the US mainland.
Songs of Sympathy and Endurance, From Voices Touched by Hurricane Patrick Shepherd and Erin Reilly watched the benefit concert on Friday night.Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times On Friday night, NBC presented an hourlong telethon, “Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together,” to raise money for the American Red Cross. It was just four days after the storm made landfall in New Jersey on a course that would smash coastal and riverside neighborhoods all the way up to Rhode Island. “One of the great ironies of this telethon is that the people who need the help most can’t watch it,” said the host, Matt Lauer. “They don’t have power.” Many of the musicians came from places affected by the storm: Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi from New Jersey, Billy Joel from Long Island and Christina Aguilera and Mary J. Blige from New York City, along with an Englishman, Sting, and three members of Aerosmith, from Boston. Photo A monitor showed Bruce Springsteen performing.Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times The songs offered sympathy, encouragement and emotive belting. There was also a little jocularity: a rendition of “Under the Boardwalk” with lead vocals shared by the talk-show host Jimmy Fallon and Steve Tyler of Aerosmith, while Mr. Joel took the doo-wop low notes and Mr. Springsteen sang in the background. (Afterward, Mr. Fallon said on Twitter, “Not my idea to sing lead.”) Between the songs were calls for donations, affirmations of Jersey roots — from Jon Stewart, Brian Williams and Danny DeVito — and news montages of destruction and desperation: surging waters, demolished carnival rides, tearful families sorting through the wreckage of destroyed homes. The show took place in NBC’s studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza with a small invited audience. But it was broadcast on many cable networks, on terrestrial and satellite radio stations and on a live Web stream. It was not a fancy production. The musicians were on a somber, darkened stage with a blue backdrop that may have been intended as aquatic. And the microphones were not always working. But some of the songwriters had done rewrites for the occasion. Mr. Joel changed the calamity in the opening verse of “Miami 2017” into a storm where “out in the Rockaways, the oceans overflowed” and “Staten Island drowned.” And when Ms. Blige sang “The Living Proof,” she changed “I” to “we,” transforming a song about individual survival into one of shared perseverance and performing it with gospel-rooted drama. Most performers stripped down their songs. Mr. Bon Jovi, preceded by a video that showed him visiting his hard-hit hometown, Sayreville, turned Bon Jovi’s ringing “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” and “Livin’ on a Prayer” into a pensive acoustic medley. Mr. Tyler and the guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, from Aerosmith, played “Dream On” without a rhythm section; it got shaky at times, but amid the telethon’s hurricane footage, one line was newly telling: “The past is gone.” Sting moved “Message in a Bottle” onto acoustic guitar, picking its intricate lines backed by a percussionist. Christina Aguilera belted “Beautiful” over a solo piano. The finale belonged to Bruce Springsteen, whose early albums were full of songs situated on the Jersey Shore — including one presciently called “4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy),” about last-chance romance amid the carnival attractions. But perhaps that would have been off-message. Instead, he chose the uplift of the more recent “Land of Hope and Dreams,” and with the E Street Band chiming behind him, he promised, “Tomorrow there’ll be sunshine/And all this darkness past.” Afterward, Mr. Springsteen added, “God bless New York. God bless the Jersey Shore.” A version of this review appears in print on November 4, 2012, on Page A31 of the New York edition with the headline: Songs of Sympathy and Endurance, From Voices Touched by Hurricane.

Tag: Sandy storm surge East Coast view of Hurricane Sandy, GOES Imagery from NOAA. October 27th 2012. Sandy has become so large that typical floater imagery doesn’t capture the entire storm. As of 11am eastern from the National Hurricane Center: Maximum sustained winds are near 75mph Minimum central pressure is near 958mb Sandy is moving North-Northeast at about 9mph. Sandy is doing a balancing act north of the Bahamas where it is trying to deepen (lower its central pressure) and expand its wind field at the same time. Fluctuations in its maximum wind speeds have been the result, and Sandy will likely continue to be at borderline hurricane status until Sunday night when it will try to strengthen as it gets energized by its merger with the trough over the interior Eastern United States. Hurricane Sandy’s pressure fell from 969mb at 11pm last night to 958mb at 11am this morning indicating deepening. While its maximum radius of tropical storm force winds expanded from 275miles at 5pm yesterday, to 450miles at 5am this morning. All Hurricane Warnings have been discontinued for now, but tropical storm conditions are still occurring in the northernmost Bahamas, offshore of Florida and North and South Carolina where tropical storm warnings are in effect. Further advisories, watches, and warnings will be needed as Sandy approaches, potentially from North Carolina to Maine. East coast states have already declared states of emergency and some evacuation notices have been posted in advance of Sandy’s landfall which is forecast to be somewhere in New Jersey or the Delmarva peninsula. Official National Hurricane Center track for Hurricane Sandy as of 11am Eastern Time. Tropical Storm Warnings for parts of North and South Carolina and the Bahamas in blue, and Tropical Storm Watches in yellow for parts of South Carolina and Bermuda. Impacts…Heavy flooding rain over 6″ in areas is likely near the storm’s path. Areas where both storm surge and flooding rains are a threat may have the flooding exacerbated by the unusually high tides down stream. Heavy wet snow is a distinct possibility in the higher elevations of Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Significant coastal flooding is also likely in areas of onshore winds and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where storm surges are forecast to reach up to 8feet and storm tides may be extreme due to the large changes between low and high tide and the astronomical high tide with the full moon on Monday. Damaging winds (30-60mph) could extend far inland causing tree damage and potentially some power outages. Structurally damaging winds (50-75mph) could occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland. Keep in mind that tropical storm force winds (sustained at >39mph) have been observed more than 400miles from the center of this storm – so even though the storm may make landfall in New Jersey, areas as far north as Maine and as far inland as Ontario and Quebec (including Lakes Erie and Ontario) could see tropical storm conditions. Areas to the south will have offshore winds, and tropical storm force winds will extend less far from the center and will be gustier in nature. In these areas, hazardously low water levels may be observed, especially at low tide. Meanwhile, there could be a period of tropical storm conditions in Bermuda (Tropical Storm Watch) sometime between tonight and Monday night as Sandy continues to expand and passes to the distant west. Squally showers will be the theme here during that period.
Hurricane Sandy Damage and Economic Impact Facts How Bad Was Hurricane Sandy? ••• John Cerone of Shirley, New York celebrates filling his gas containers at a Valero gas station in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, on November 5, 2012 in Mastic, New York. Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey on October 29, 2012. It did $71.5 billion in economic damage, according to the National Hurricane Center. It had been a Category 3 storm, but downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it made landfall. The storm damaged or destroyed at least 650,000 homes, and 8 million customers lost power. Storm surges were massive: 8 1/2 feet higher than normal at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and 12 1/2 feet at Kings Point, Long Island. Sandy closed the New York Stock Exchange, the first time in 27 years since Hurricane Gloria. Even the electronic exchanges, based in New Jersey, were closed so as not to endanger the workers there. The exchanges were also closed on Tuesday, the first two-day closure due to weather since 1888. What Made Sandy So Bad Sandy hit the Eastern seaboard just in time for Halloween 2012. This monster was dubbed Frankenstorm by the National Weather Service because it combined an end-of-season Category 1 hurricane with a cold front and a second storm, turning torrential rain into snow. Even before hitting land, Sandy was the largest tropical storm in the Atlantic, reaching 900 miles in diameter. This system, combined with the 150-mph winds of the jet stream, pushed the monster north toward Pennsylvania and New York State. The storm was pushed into the United States by a third weather pattern known as the North Atlantic Oscillation. As it hit shore, it picked up more moisture from the Gulf Stream. To make matters even worse, Sandy made landfall just in time for the full moon, making storm surges even higher than normal. Sandy was a once-in-a-lifetime storm event, putting 50 million people at risk. Tragically, 72 people died directly because of the hurricane, and another 87 deaths occurred from hypothermia due to power outages, carbon monoxide and accidents during cleanup. Flooding and Winds Impact The storm surge hit a 600-mile stretch of the Eastern Seaboard. Lower Manhattan's Battery Park was hit by 14-foot waves, beating Hurricane Donna's 10.02-foot record set in September 1960. More than 80% of Atlantic City was underwater, and some of the Boardwalk was swept away. All five Great Lakes were warned of gale force winds as the storm headed their way on Tuesday. Waves 20 to 25 feet are possible on the south side of Lake Michigan. Winds reached a high of 80 mph when Sandy made landfall. That's when the hurricane was downgraded from to a post-tropical storm. Winds were felt as far west as the Great Lakes and into Canada. Power Outages Sandy hit power stations hard. More than 8 million people were without power, as stations flooded and trees fell on power lines. Con Ed said it received the worst damage to its system ever, leaving 780,000 people without power. This included many hospitals. NYU Langone and Coney Island were evacuated. Lower Manhattan was completely dark. Officials said full power might not be returned for a week, as they were still assessing the damage. Repairmen were literally pumping water out of the electrical tunnels. New York State requested 4,000 utility workers from as far away as California. At least 90% of Long Island was without power, affecting 800,000 people. Transportation Grounded Since Sandy hit a major travel hub, it severely affected transportation. More than 15,000 flights into New York and other East Coast airports were canceled. As of the Tuesday following the storm, all three New York airports were closed. New York subways were flooded with seawater and remained closed as of Tuesday morning. This was the worst damage in its 108-year history. All trains had been moved to yards and were not damaged. MTA bus systems were shut down. Limited bus service was restored Tuesday afternoon, and 100 percent reactivated by the Wednesday following the storm. AMTRAK was closed. Bridges and roadways were closed in Manhattan. East River bridges were open as of Tuesday. Cab drivers were allowed to pick up more than one passenger. Blizzard Impact As the storm hit the cold front, rain turned to snow. That brought blizzard conditions and dropped two to three feet of snow on West Virginia. Some areas of southwestern Virginia and Kentucky received two feet of now. The Appalachians in North Carolina and Tennessee received up to 18 inches. (Source: "Sandy May Push Record Surge Into Manhattan," Bloomberg, October 29, 2012. CNBC broadcast.) Property Damage There were more than 20 fires in the greater New York area. The largest was a six-alarm fire in Queens, More than 80 homes were destroyed despite the efforts of more than 200 firefighters who braved the hurricane to put out the fire. (Source: CNBC.) Impact on Gas and Oil Prices Gas price futures dropped after the storm, despite the closure of some refineries. Oil prices initially fell, since there was temporarily be less demand from closed refineries. (Source: CNBC. "Oil Slides Gasoline Gains as Sandy Nears United States," Bloomberg, October 29, 2012.) How Sandy Compares to Other Big Storms Sandy was the fourth most damaging hurricane. The worst was Hurricane Katrina, a Category 3 storm. It cost the economy between $108 billion to $250 billion. It left 1,836 people dead. Most of Katrina's damage was due to flooding in New Orleans. The second most damaging was Hurricane Harvey. This Category 4 storm hit Texas on August 25, 2017. It cost $180 billion and killed 70 people. The third was Hurricane Irma. It was a Category 5 storm that cost the economy $100 billion. Most of the damage occurred after it hit Florida on September 10, 2017. The unofficial death toll is 101 people. Sandy beat Hurricane Ike. It was a Category 2 storm that hit Texas in 2008. It cost the U.S. economy $29.5 billion. The area had just been devastated by Hurricane Gustav two weeks earlier. Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 storm that hit Florida in 1992. It destroyed $26.5 billion in property. The worst storm to hit New York before Sandy was Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The Category 2 storm caused $4.5 billion in damage. The most recent storm that hit New York before Sandy was Hurricane Isabel in 2003. This Category 2 storm caused $3.4 billion in damage.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Thursday, November 15, 2012 Hurricane Sandy NWS Assessment Terminated Well, that was fast. The entire National Weather Service's "Service Assessment" for the "Hurricane Sandy Event" (as the assessment team named the study, hereinafter SA) has been terminated. In an email at 9:46 this morning, Douglas Young of the National Weather Service wrote the SA team members: I am writing to inform you that effective immediately we are terminating the spin-up of the National Weather Service Sandy Service Assessment Team.We have been informed that a larger, multi-agency review of this event may take place... [emphasis mine] The NWS, instead, decided to go ahead with its internal service assessment but for the first time put an outsider -- me -- in the co-chair position. I was told by David Caldwell, Director, Office of Climate, Water and Weather Services, that I would learn the NWS wanted an unbiased and thorough examination of Sandy. Given the scores of deaths and the huge level of damage (according to media reports 100,000+ are still without power), even with excellent forecasts the Sandy Assessment may have been the most important the National Weather Service has ever conducted. Now it has been stopped. Why? In the short period of time I worked on this project, a number of interesting questions surfaced: Was there a decision not to call Sandy a "hurricane" regardless of its meteorological characteristics? If this decision was made, was it made Friday (October 26th) or Saturday morning? If so, who made the decision and why? Was this decision the reason hurricane warnings, in spite of a large and dangerous hurricane moving toward the coast, were never issued? Given that an obvious large and powerful hurricane was headed for the U.S. coast, why wasn't that decision reconsidered? For example, Barry Myers, the CEO of AccuWeather, urged (on the AccuWeather.com website) the immediate issuance of hurricane warnings about eight hours before landfall. Others also urged the lack of hurricane warnings to be reconsidered. While the team's work officially didn't begin until Tuesday (November 13), I had already gathered hundreds of pages of information, literally dozens of suggestions, and some rather tantalizing leads that Sandy may or may not have been handled as it should have been from a scientific, administrative, or communications standpoint. Now, in spite of all of the suffering and billions in damage, we may never know how well all the storm was handled. A personal note: I was very impressed with the other members of the SA team. I'm sorry we will not be able to complete our assignment. 22 comments: I've very puzzled by this blog post. We were told for a week that a 'hurricane' was headed up the coast. I've seen disputes as to whether Sandy was actually a hurricane or not when it made landfall, but it was known that 'Frankenstorm' was coming by everyone who didn't live under a rock. And in any case, while Sandy covered an exceptionally large area, it was not a particularly strong storm. As far as I'm aware, Sandy was a borderline Cat1 storm. The term 'hurricane' may have insurance implications, but for the general public at the time, there was no mystery. And the most serious damage in New York City was a function not of the 'hurricane' rating of the storm, but of the geometry of the New York Bight, which funneled the storm surge right into New York Harbor. If Sandy had made landfall in Boston, we'd be talking about a lot of rain, and power lines down. You make this sound like some nefarious conspiracy, when - even if it was - I can't see how it matters. New England takes a battering every year from Nor'easters, with much less than hurricane winds. Could it (the investigation) have been stopped because if it is declared a hurricane then the insurance companies would have to pay out? I'm hearing from many people here in NJ... their insurance wont cover anything because it was once declared a hurricane and down graded to a tropical storm. Some even called it a cyclone. They can't categorize it except for calling it an "Act of God." And the insurance companies are using this as a way to not cover their clients. :-( @Rob: The NWS has wasted a week of my life (still have my regular job to do, was working till 1am on SA work multiple nights). I'm not going to scan documents. That said, if you would like to see some of the questions and comments for the SA take a look at my request to readers to ask questions for the SA team: http://meteorologicalmusings.blogspot.com/2012/11/hurricane-sandy-life-takes-ironic-turn.html From the infectious disease crisis / disaster point of view, this is our opinion, which agrees with yours: WHEN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE OR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISRUPTION OCCURS, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD FUNCTION UNDER MANDATE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WITH AN UNBIASED ASSESSMENT OF WARNING, WARNING-RESPONSE COUPLING, AND RESPONSE. The fact this does not occur in the public health world is a failure of governance in of itself. The fact that NWS appears to be attempting the same tact as well may be worthy of a bipartisan Congressional investigation. What usually happens when there is this large of an impact is avoidance of an open investigation by those in the elected leadership. A pattern observed over and over again. While NWS may have decided to proceed in good faith, it may be the leadership has intervened... the question is, for what purpose? "the Sandy Assessment may have been the most important the National Weather Service has ever conducted. Now it has been stopped. Why?" Maybe they read "Sirens" and got cold feet? After all, the entities that would be scrutinized this time around have even LESS excuse for their lapses/failures than SGF, SPC, local EM, etc. did in Joplin. With Sandy, all involved had DAYS of advance warning and multiple reliable forecast models agreeing (after some initial divergence) on where the storm would track. So how would they justify, for instance, not issuing hurricane warnings for a storm that looked, walked, and quacked like a hurricane? I still wonder if Hurricane Warnings would have made a difference. I say this in part from the fallout of Irene and the over forecasting of this storms intensity on the coast. If the high wind warning were questioned why not issue or create ad hoc a High Wind Warning for Hurricane Force winds? The NWS is now using enhanced tornado warnings (Tornado Emergency). Why not issue an enhanced High Wind Warning? Also too another issue was the fact that the worst coastal flooding occurred at the time of high tide and the surge. While surge was correctly forecast the storm flood tide was higher 13+ feet over the NY Bight. Advisories should have forecast maximum flood waters or potential maximum flood heights not the surge. Someone hears 6-11 feet storm surge public perception is oh 6-11 feet of water will come onshore. Also why not include communicative benchmarks in the coastal flood warning like the NWS issues with river flood warnings. e.g a river is forecast to go into MAJOR flood then the flood advisory mentions at major flood the water plant at such and such location is undated or this road or that is cutoff. Do the same kind of BM with the coastal flood warning: at 6.5 feet water enters the PATH Tubes at 7 feet they flood and water enters the trans-Hudson Tunnels. At 7.5 feet water spills over the Battery, etc. I think it would have made a difference... Bloomberg waited an extra 24 hours to order an evacuation... And did so only for zone A. If you listen to his press conference from Saturday (before the storm), it was clear he was getting intelligence that it would not be as bad as a hurricane or tropical storm. Plus, by definition, hurricane warnings automatically trigger certain evacuations and emergency steps that were not taken. In this case, time wasted = lives lost in my opinion. @Andrew: Please see my post in Mike's original blog on the assessment team's ask. To review: NWS' Meteorological Development Laboratory and the WFO's indeed have the capability to produce both storm surge INUNDATION forecasts, and potential impact wording that provides "real world" language for what a high to extreme level of impact can do (i.e. "water up to the level of a two story home"; "vehicles washed away", "Hundreds of structures inundated or washed away", etc). Both of these functions were used effectively during Isaac. My hunch is that the lack of a hurricane warning was reason for the local offices and MDL not to issue these information streams - which may have helped clarify decisions. http://weather.gov/tcig (click on an office for potential impact wording...suggest Brownsville or New Orleans for best examples) http://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/phish (Probability of Hurricane Inundation from Surge Height). "Could it (the investigation) have been stopped because if it is declared a hurricane then the insurance companies would have to pay out?" I don't think so. From what I understand (I live in the Midwest so I don't have to worry about this, but a lot of other people do), the common practice nowadays is for insurance policies to have a much higher deductible (usually a percentage of the home's total value rather than a flat dollar amount) when the damage is from a "named storm", which includes both hurricanes and tropical storms. As long as Sandy was a "named storm" that clause would apply.
Hurricane Sandy: Remembering the historic storm and its aftermath By ROSANNE SALVATORE AND KATHRYN KATTALIA Oct 25, 2017 | 5:13 PM Hurricane Sandy struck with a vengeance on Oct. 29, 2012, causing unprecedented destruction as 80 mph winds and record storm surges wreaked havoc across the East Coast. As the city observes the 4th anniversary, take a look back the destruction caused by the biggest storm to ever hit the US mainland.
Mass transit, schools and financial markets are closed across most of the tristate region as Hurricane Sandy heads north. Wind gusts are intensifying. Mass transit, schools and financial markets are closed across most of the tristate region as Hurricane Sandy heads north. Wind gusts are intensifying. The Category 1 storm is forecasted to make landfall late Monday night into Tuesday morning. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to start planning for an orderly suspension of service. New York City subways and buses started phasing out service at 7 p.m. Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road suspended service at 7 p.m. Sunday. The city's mass transit system is the nation's largest. The subway alone has a daily ridership of more than 5 million. NJ Transit, PATH and Amtrak also shut down service in the region. Bridges and tunnels will be closed on a case-by-case basis. Rainfall is expected to start late Sunday or early Monday in New York. Hurricane Sandy is headed north from the Caribbean to meet a winter storm and a cold front. Experts say the rare hybrid storm that results will cause havoc over 800 miles from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. City officials ordered an evacuation of Zone A areas that are prone to flooding. New York City public schools were ordered closed on Monday. On Saturday, the MTA had workers nailing plywood covers to subway ventilation grates at South Ferry to help prevent flooding. The agency began to secure subway covers after flooding by a severe rainstorm on August 8, 2007. After that storm the MTA started a program to raise the grates in sidewalks that ventilate the subway at flood-prone locations. The raised ventilation grates are located in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, and help reduce the amount of water that enters the subway system from street level. All are designed to be attention-getting so that pedestrians don't stumble into them, and in some cases they double as bicycle racks, benches, and artistic stainless steel sculptural forms. Hurricane Sandy Notes: - New York City ordered an evacuation of Zone A areas of the city and schools were ordered closed on Monday. - Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed the New York Army and Air National Guard to mobilize in response to Hurricane Sandy. - Gov. Chris Christie ordered evacuations of New Jersey barrier islands and closed all state offices on Monday. - Gov. Dannel Malloy ordered evacuations of parts of several Connecticut cities and said the state is likely to see the worst-case scenario from the storm. - All mass transit in and out of New York City was being shut down on Sunday night including MTA, NJ Transit and PATH service. - Major carriers canceled all flights into and out of three area airports in the New York metro area. - New York Downtown Hospital in Lower Manhattan was evacuated Sunday due to the threat of power loss in the area - Broadway took the threat of the mammoth storm seriously, with theater owners canceling all Sunday evening and Monday performances - The New York Stock Exchange and the NYMEX were shutting their trading floors in New York Monday but trading will continue electronically Mass transit, schools and financial markets are closed across most of the tristate region as Hurricane Sandy heads north.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Friday, October 26, 2012 8AM Friday: Hurricane Sandy Update A very prominent and respected National Weather Service meteorologist wrote on Facebook last night, I've never seen anything like this and I'm at a loss for expletives to describe what this storm could do. Yes, I've never seen anything like it either nor have our modern meteorological tools. As I wrote yesterday afternoon, we don't know whether our tools are up to the task because no storm of this nature has occurred in the modern meteorological era. With that bit of explanation, here is my forecast and advice. It is near certain Hurricane Sandy will make landfall rather than turning out to sea. There is some clustering in the models between Long Island and DelMarVa. In this case the specific center of the storm is much less important than in most hurricanes because the high winds will be spread out away from the center. There will be flooding rains. While the exact path of the heaviest rains may shift some to the north or south, large areas of six inch and greater rainfalls will cause flooding. If you live in a flood plain, you need to be prepared to evacuate. Power will fail in a large geographic area. There is a fair amount of inconsistent information this morning pertaining to peak gusts, i.e., will they be 60 mph or 80 mph? But, since power often fails with a 60 mph gust, it may not matter. Because of the geographic extent (winds capable of causing power failures in a swath hundreds of miles in width), there could be massive power failures and, once out, the power may be out for weeks. Snow will likely fall and it may be heavy. Why does it matter that it is snowing over the central High Plains? Because that is the cold air that will reach the western part of Sandy's circulation causing the rain to change to snow in the Appalachians. The snow will be heavy in places and may contribute to additional power failures. The storm surge will be destructive. Because wind speed and direction are so important, I can't offer a map of predicted storm surges yet. But, there will be areas where the combination of full moon, waves of more than 20 feet, and storm surge cause great destruction in coastal areas. So, how should you prepare? Here are my suggestions. Get prescriptions refilled now, especially if your doctor must approve the refill. Vote. If the stronger models are correct, power could still be out in some paces on election day. Regardless, that is one less thing you will need to do. The election will not (and shouldn't be) postponed. If you can get an electrician to install a generator, get it done. Do not try to install a generator yourself. If you don't have a generator, get a power inverter or two. Radio Shack and similar stores sell them. They are a "poor man's generator" and will keep your cell phone, laptop, and similar charged. Keep your car's gas tank full. If you have a wood-burning fireplace and you know your chimney is clear, get wood. Keep some indoors to keep it dry during the storm. You may need it to heat your home. If you live in a 100-year flood plain (you can check at city hall or your library) or on the coast figure out your evacuation strategy now. Make your list of things you will take with you. Fill a few gas cans (the type you would use for your mower) to have extra in the event of power failures. Purchase extra staples. Without power, stores will be closed. Purchase booster batteries for your cell phone and other essential equipment. If you need insulin or other medicine that must be kept chilled make plans now. Consider what you would do if you were without electricity for a month. If you have an invalid living with you that requires electricity, there will be areas that will be without for weeks. Be proactive. If you live in a heavily wooded area, does someone in your vicinity have a gasoline-powered chain saw? Does it have fuel and a reasonably good chain/blade? Test it, now. Get to an ATM. Without power, credit card readers and ATMs will not be working. In a disaster, cash is king. And, if you are planning to travel by air to or through airports between Richmond-Boston Monday through Wednesday, forget it. Here is what you should do, now. Amtrak in the Northeast Corridor will likely have service interruptions. We are in uncharted territory here. I believe this will be a major storm that will dominate the news for days. Prepare accordingly. 4 comments: Thanks. I added some things when I shared on Facebook: . Might I add charge your cell phones, make sure you have a cell phone car charger, plenty of candles/matches, puzzle books & pencils, games and things to keep you busy while the electricity is out. Also, buy plenty of charcoal and/or propane. Here's the latest Noaa predication for Sandy.http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdepd.

Yes...car charger. Also understand that when your cell phone is on and the cell towers are out your cell phone will use more battery power to search for a connection...so you may want to turn it off...Good luck.

George W Bush’s presidency never fully recovered from his botched handling of Hurricane Katrina. Barack Obama won re-election just days after Hurricane Sandy struck. So how can presidents respond effectively to natural disasters? And how has Donald Trump managed the response to Harvey and Irma? Nate Berg tells the story of Rebuild By Design, a competition – and now its own organisation – based on taking a more proactive approach to disaster response in cities; but how far can you prepare for the effects of climate change? The Rockefeller Foundation’s president has been interested in the idea of resilience ever since she was a psychology student. Her experience of disasters such as Katrina and Sandy have turned it into her life’s mission

Hurricane Central Superstorm Sandy Anniversary: Remembering Hurricane Sandy Two Years Later By Eric Zerkel October 29 2014 07:00 PM EDT weather.com On this day two years ago, Superstorm Sandy made an unusual left turn and slammed head first into the population dense East Coast, changing history forever. People often forget the beginning. Sandy was born on Oct. 22, 2012, in the Caribbean, only six hours after being named as Tropical Depression 18. In two days Sandy was a hurricane, weaving through the Caribbean, dealing a blow to Jamaica before scraping Haiti and making landfall on Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane. But the worst for the U.S. would come when Sandy swerved west, dealing a left haymaker square on the jaw of the Mid-Atlantic, particularly New Jersey and New York. Before Sandy made landfall on the U.S. it was massive. As the animation above shows, before Sandy even made landfall, tropical storm force winds extended outward in diameter some 943 miles from southwest to northeast, the biggest circulation of any tropical system on record. The sheer size of the storm played an important role in the devastation Sandy dealt to the East Coast. Among the many factor that influence storm surge, size matters, because as the National Hurricane Center notes , bigger storms impact a greater area of the ocean over a longer period of time than smaller storms, thereby enabling a large storm to push more ocean water ashore. As a result, coastal areas in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut experienced massive storm surge. Kings Point, New York, took on 12.65 feet of storm surge alone. Total water levels at Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan, rose to nearly 14 feet. That storm surge quickly crept into Queen's oceanfront Breezy Point neighborhood and infamously set off a six-alarm fire at around 10 p.m. local time. With streets flooded, firefighters couldn't traverse area and the fire soon spread to the entire neighborhood, reducing more than 130 homes to an ashen scar. Due to funding issues, most of the neighborhood has struggled to return to its former glory, even two years later. Just 30 people have rebuilt in Breezy Point since the fire, reports CBS News, but others are still under construction, a sign that the area might once again be whole again. The same was true for New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall. In casino-rich Atlantic City, New Jersey, nearly 9 feet of water swept ashore, damaging a section of the boardwalk and washing away roads and portions of homes in the area. Seaside Heights, New Jersey, along with its iconic boardwalk and amusement rides, also fell victim to Sandy's storm surge, slipping into the sea. An indelible image emerged from the scene: The skeleton of The Star Jet rollercoaster jutting out of the Atlantic Ocean, its tracks taking on waves. Tens of millions of dollars in damage were dealt to New Jersey's boardwalks alone. And only recently, The Wall Street Journal reports, did all repairs conclude, returning Seaside Heights, Ocean Grove and Long Branch's stretches of boardwalk back to normal again. Water cut through the barrier island of Mantoloking, New Jersey, (shown above) dramatically eroding the sand and cutting off homes from inland New Jersey. The same devastating scene played out along more than 100 miles of New Jersey coastline, particularly in Ocean and Monmouth counties. By the time Sandy had left New Jersey, some 346,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in the state, The New York Times reports. These are just a couple of the thousands of storylines that unfolded in late October two years ago. Because of the size and scope of the Superstorm Sandy it's nearly impossible to tell them all.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Saturday, October 27, 2012 9:50am Saturday: Hurricane Sandy Update That's Hurricane Sandy with the eye east of Cape Canaveral. Maximum sustained winds are 75 mph and the pressure is 960 millibars. It is moving slightly east of due north. Because this is going to be a rather long post, I'm going to break it down by hazards to try to make it a little easier to follow. Location The center of the storm will likely come ashore in the area shaded in blue. However, the location of the center is much less important than in a more typical hurricane. In the case of Sandy, the storm's winds will be hugely spread out. To illustrate, take a look at this forecast valid at 8pm EDT Monday from the European model. If you consider the red to be wind gusts strong enough to cause power lines to fall, there could be power failures from Richmond to Portland. Very strong winds for Wilmington, Philadelphia and into NYC are forecast. Now, I don't want you to take this position literally. It could be a little farther north or south. The point is that dangerous winds, if this forecast is correct, will cover a vast geographic area rather than being concentrated within 10 to 25 mi. of the eye as in a typical hurricane. Timing In eastern Virginia, far northeast North Carolina and DelMarVa, the winds will begin rising Monday morning, perhaps even before sunrise. In other areas, the winds will increase during the day Monday. As I have said many times, if you have plans to fly through an airport north of Raleigh and east of Pittsburgh Monday or Tuesday, forget it. Even if the airline runs the flight in, the risks of getting stranded at the airport in a last-minute cancellation are too great. Wednesday will probably be a mess, as well. Route around the storm. You can learn how to do all of this in my Airline Crisis Survival Guide. Wind We really are in uncharted (literally) territory here for two reasons: The forecast barometric pressures are the lowest in history in this part of the world. Because there is a strong correlation between the rate of change of barometric pressure (known as the "pressure gradient") and wind speeds, there are no past histories to draw upon. We don't know if our tools, because they have never been tested with a storm of this nature, are giving us accurate barometric pressure forecasts. So, I've got to give you my best scientifically educated estimate. The map below is from my colleagues at AccuWeather who are following the storm and I suggest you visit for a second opinion. This could shift a little north or south. Note that the highest winds extend into coastal New England. There are two things about this map I wish to stress: Somewhere, there will be gusts above 80 and perhaps 90 mph. If a thunderstorm complex can mix some dry air down, there will be a gust to 100 mph somewhere in this region. The second aspect is that the winds will continue for hours and that pounding will contribute to the overall damage. Coastal Flooding In two national news articles yesterday this wasn't even mentioned! I really fear storm surge is being underemphasized in the news coverage. Here is AccuWeather's map. The 5-10' storm surge doesn't seem like much until you add two feet for the full moon and wave action to 20' or even more. So, do the math: 10' (surge) + 2' (lunar) + 20' (wave) = 32 feet above sea level That's right, there could be spots where ocean water gets to 32 feet above sea level! Can't tell exactly where that will be yet, but if you live near the coast you need to be prepared to evacuate. Be working on that now! River Flooding Fortunately, most of the region has been relatively dry the last few weeks. However, enough rain is going to fall in some areas that river flooding will develop. National Weather Service Snow/Blizzard Conditions The shaded counties are under a winter storm watch. The watch may need to be expanded as the storm's path becomes more certain. From Greg Carbin and NWS, here is the spread of snowfall amounts for Elkins, WV: Before you say, "Whoa, that's a spread of 5" to 35"!" let me say we agree with you. We aren't used to forecasting snow in tropical weather systems. If the cold air gets into the system soon enough and deep enough, yes, more than three feet of snow will fall. The combination of wet snow and high winds will cause power failures in this region if the heavier snow amounts indeed occur. Tornadoes Probably some, but impossible to estimate where. So What Do I Do Now? There are a number of good lists out there. Here are my suggestions: Get prescriptions refilled now, especially if you doctor must approve the refill. If you have a relative at home that requires electricity for life-assistance purposes, you may want to move he or she outside of the higher wind zone. Vote Monday morning if you can safely do so. If the stronger models are correct, power could still be out in some paces on Election Day. Regardless, that is one less thing you will need to do. The election will not (and shouldn't be) postponed. If you can get an electrician to install a generator, get it done. Do not try to install a generator yourself. If you don't have a generator, get a power inverter or two. Radio Shack and similar stores sell them. They are a "poor man's generator" and will keep your cell phone, laptop, and similar items charged. Tell the person in the store what you want to run off it so you get one of the right size. Do not try to run the inverter for hours at a time as that is tough on your car's battery. Charge the (for example) cell phone and let the charge run all the way down, then use the inverter to recharge. Keep your car's gas tank full. If you have a wood-burning fireplace and you know your chimney is clear, get wood. Keep some indoors to keep it dry during the storm. You may need it to heat your home. If you live in a 100-year flood plain (you can check at city hall or your library) or on the coast figure out your evacuation strategy now. Make your list of things you will take with you. Be prepared to leave at short notice. Fill a few gas cans (the type you would use for your mower) to have extra in the event of power failures. Purchase extra food staples. Without power, stores will be closed. Things that require less preparation are better. Bottled water is especially important. Purchase booster batteries for your cell phone and other essential equipment. If you need insulin or other medicine that must be kept chilled make plans now. Consider what you would do if you were without electricity for a month. If you have an invalid living with you that requires electricity, there will be areas that will be without for weeks. Be proactive. If you live in a heavily wooded area, does someone in your vicinity have a gasoline-powered chain saw? Does it have fuel and a reasonably good chain/blade? Test it, now. Get to an ATM. Without power, credit card readers and ATMs will not be working. In a disaster, cash is king. Addition: If you are in the high wind area, thoroughly photograph your home and possessions now. You will need it for insurance purposes. This includes trees, shrubs, etc. Then, if using a digital camera, upload to internet so it will be there after the storm in case the worse happens. Stockpile some good books, magazines, board games and keep a good attitude. Look at this as one of life's adventures. Good luck!! Addition: Just got an email asking why I didn't mention candles, Coleman lantern or flashlights (and batteries). It was because I assumed, perhaps, incorrectly that every household has those, hurricane or not. If you don't have them, please add them to your list. Make sure the batteries in the smoke detectors are good, especially if you are going to be using candles. I hasten to point out that this forecast could change if the forecast track or intensity changes. I'm posting this to illustrate the serious nature of Hurricane Sandy. Here is the forecast water heights for Bridgeport, CT: 8 comments: Not if power outages due to this storm last through Election Day, which very well could happen if some of these forecasts are correct. Keep in mind that electronic voting, sometimes without any paper trail, is the norm in many areas now. @Debbiy: I'm well aware of the date of the election. However, many states allow early voting and absentee voting. Given that power failures may persistent in some areas through Election Day, it makes sense to do it early if local laws and meteorological conditions Monday allow. I've been watching this storm for ~week (I have a great fondness for late bloomers) and it took me nearly a day to remember the election is the FOLLOWING week. I'm sure I'm not alone. We are all so desperate to have this over with... :) I realize this is completely shameless self-promotion, but might I recommend my iPhone/iPad app for home inventory management? It has a cloud component: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tmi-manager/id426861163?mt=8 It works well, and is cheap. Sorry if this seems crass, but it really is a good solution, and seemed to be the right fit for your point about taking photographs of your home and possessions for insurance purposes.

Saturday, October 27, 2012 11:40PM: Hurricane Sandy Update The National Weather Service's strategy of sending up extra weather balloons has worked. The models have pretty well clustered on a corridor for Sandy's center. "Spaghetti Chart" showing the various models' path of Hurricane Sandy Very heavy rains will be moving inland with Hurricane Sandy. Areas with five or more inches of rain will likely see river flooding. Areas with heavier rain may see major flooding. All of the models show a major storm with damaging winds. Trees will topple -- and in areas with heavy rains -- there will be considerable tree uprooting and power line damage. Here is the GFS model at six hour intervals. Keep in mind the system may come inland a little north or south of this path, so focus on the pattern rather than exact locations. The 937 millibar center would be an all-time record low barometric pressure. This forecast is valid at 8pm EDT Monday evening. Consider red as strong enough winds to cause power failures. Extreme winds near NYC and the southern New England coast. This is the forecast for 2am EDT Tuesday. Note that many areas still have red winds. The pounding will last hours, including the Delaware-Maryland-DC-NE Virginia region. 8am Tuesday. Gusty winds still around Washington, D.C. Note the strong winds around the eastern Great Lakes. Yes, there will probably be tornadoes but we cannot pin down the locations yet. Finally, the blue is a winter storm watch where the snow accumulation will likely be measured in feet. The brown is a high wind "watch" (it should be a warning) and the green is a flood watch.
Hurricane Sandy, which arrived in New Jersey and New York on Oct. 29, “affected many, many more people and places than Katrina,” Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters at a news briefing. He said the comparison between the two hurricanes “puts this entire conversation, I believe, in focus.” Mr. Cuomo said the recent storm would cost New York State nearly $42 billion, and he huddled in his Midtown office with the state’s Congressional delegation, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester County executives, to strategize on lobbying Washington for financial assistance. Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that more people had been killed by Hurricane Katrina, but said that Hurricane Sandy had had a greater economic impact because of the dense population in the New York City area. He said Hurricane Sandy had destroyed or damaged more units of housing, affected more businesses and caused more customers to lose power. Mr. Cuomo said he believed it would cost nearly $33 billion to pay for storm cleanup, including more than $15 billion in New York City, and an additional $9 billion to prepare for future storms. Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said he was expected to meet with House and Senate leaders on Wednesday. Some of the amounts in the aid request were staggering: the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which totaled its damages at $4.8 billion, said it would cost $600 million just to repair the South Ferry-Whitehall Street subway stop in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Bloomberg and the New York lawmakers, mindful that President Obama and Congressional leaders in both parties are preparing for difficult negotiations on a deficit reduction plan, acknowledged that their request would not be easily won. “This will be an effort that lasts not weeks, but many months,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat. Yet several Republicans in the Congressional delegation predicted that their Republican colleagues in the House would be more accommodating to the state’s request for aid now that the governor has presented a plan that lays out the needs of the city and state in stark terms. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. “This is a bare-bones request,” said Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican whose district includes areas on Staten Island that were devastated by the storm. “This is not based on want. It is based on need.” Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, agreed, saying “there’s nothing exaggerated” in the governor’s aid request. “We have to convince Congress that this is an absolute necessity,” he said. Several lawmakers are pushing to have Congress approve additional disaster aid before it adjourns this year, arguing that any urgency to deal with the matter now will almost certainly fade as the weeks pass and lawmakers turn their attention to other matters. “It has to happen, as far as I am concerned, now,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Westchester who is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. “This is an emergency.” A spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, declined to comment until the White House has submitted a request for supplemental funds to pay for disaster recovery efforts. But Mr. King said Mr. Boehner had committed to providing money to New York State and New Jersey without demanding spending cuts that would offset the appropriations. (New Jersey estimates its cost at nearly $30 billion.) And Mr. Cuomo, who has not been to Washington since taking office nearly two years ago, invited Mr. Boehner to come see the damage himself and offered to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby the speaker. “I understand the fiscal pressures that Washington is under,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I also understand the fiscal pressure that New York is under. And I know that the taxpayers of New York cannot shoulder this burden, and I don’t think it’s fair to ask them to shoulder this burden.” David W. Chen contributed reporting.

Flooded Tunnels May Keep City’s Subway Network Closed for Several Days Workers pumped water out of the South Ferry subway station at the tip of Manhattan, which was filled with water up to the ceiling after Hurricane Sandy struck.Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times It spans 468 stations and over 600 miles of track, pulsing through four of New York City’s five boroughs as the great uniter of the area. Everyone pays the same fare. Everyone has a preferred line. Everyone curses its fussy weekend service. And almost everyone uses the subway. Until it goes dark. On Tuesday, as officials discovered the breadth of tunnel flooding from an enormous hurricane, New Yorkers were warned that the bulk of the muscular subway network could be lost for “a good four or five days,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said. As the remnants of Hurricane Sandy left the city on Tuesday, transit officials surveyed the damage to the system, which they shut down on Sunday night as a precaution. What they found was an unprecedented assault: flooded tunnels, battered stations and switches and signals likely damaged. Seven subway tunnels beneath the East River, many of which provide critical connections between Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, were flooded, Mr. Lhota said. The South Ferry station at the southern tip of Manhattan was filled “track to ceiling” with water, the authority said. Limited bus service returned on Tuesday afternoon, and a full schedule was expected for Wednesday. Mr. Lhota suggested that if subway service could be partially restored in less-affected areas of the system — the Manhattan and Brooklyn legs of the No. 4 train, for instance, but not the tunnel that connects them — buses may be rerouted to complement functioning stretches. “You don’t have to run a line from end to end,” Mr. Lhota said in an interview. “You can do intermediate terminals or stop-off points.” But the transportation agency offered no estimate as to when even part of the subway system might return. The Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road commuter train lines were also devastated, suffering power losses as fallen trees and other debris littered the system. In Ossining, N.Y., a 40-foot boat had been tossed along the tracks used by the Hudson line of Metro-North. Bridges and Tunnels After the Storm In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie said he expected PATH trains to be unavailable for at least seven to 10 days. New Jersey Transit has also suspended operations. The authority’s two tunnels, the Brooklyn-Battery and Queens-Midtown, remained closed through Tuesday afternoon, though most of the city’s other major crossings, including the Robert F. Kennedy, Verrazano-Narrows, Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, were reopened throughout the day. The Lincoln Tunnel was never closed. The subway shutdown, though, provided an extension of last year’s grim reminder during Tropical Storm Irene: the system, which runs 24 hours a day, can indeed go dark. Last summer, the transportation authority undertook a systemwide shutdown of the subways as the tropical storm approached. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. But while that shutdown began at noon on a Saturday, with service restoration beginning by early Monday, Hurricane Sandy’s sweep across the region has ensured that at least one business week, if not more, will be upended. Last year, riders could take comfort in knowing that the shutdown was voluntary. This storm prompted a willful suspension of service, but then ensured that the system would remain down well after it passed. On Monday, the authority said that pumping water out of flooded tunnels could take anywhere from 14 hours to more than 4 days. After that task is complete, the authority will still need to address any damage to its electronic signaling system or switches, which were susceptible to saltwater corrosion. Mr. Lhota said he was not aware of any permanent damage to the system. A team of specialists from the Army Corps of Engineers was summoned to clear the system. It is the first time that the team — based in Rock Island, Ill., and made up of two mechanical engineers and two hydrologists — has been asked to help clear water outside of New Orleans since it was created after Hurricane Katrina. At the Clark Street station in Brooklyn Heights, several transit workers said they had tried to walk through the No. 2 train tunnel to Wall Street in the early afternoon but had to turn back because it was still full of water. Residents in the neighborhood walked into the station periodically and asked police officers when the trains would be running. “They’re saying a week,” one of the officers told a man in sweat pants and a Windbreaker. “A week — oh, oh, oh!” said the man, Lee Breuer, one of the founders of the Mabou Mines theater company. He said he did not need to get anywhere immediately; his appointment at an unemployment office on Monday was canceled, and he was told to come back when the trains were running again.

Police say the post-storm changes in the crime level were to be expected. NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said the department has seen this before during major disasters and their aftermath. Advertisement "After a natural disaster or large-scale catastrophe like 9/11, we see conventional crime come down," Browne said. "A lot of people are indoors. Taverns are closed. You have less people out late at night and getting into disputes." Last year there were 267 burglaries in the five-day period, compared with 271 reported since Sandy - a 3% increase. "The fact that burglaries are up is not surprising," said Browne. "There are a lot of unlit areas." There have been a number of looting incidents in the city's hard-hit areas, including the Rockaways and Coney Island, but Browne said the Sandy-related looting pales in comparison to what occurred during the city's major blackouts of the past. There have been fewer than 10 arrests related to disputes at city gas stations, where anxious customers have been waiting for hours to fuel up due to a widespread storm-related shortage.

Kathy Culbertson, 51, of Ventnor Heights, stands, almost, in the ground floor of her house, which took in three feet of water during Sandy. Insurance wouldnât cover, and repairs paid for by a state grant rendered the former in-law suite useless. Sandy was the storm that landed in Brigantine, canceled Halloween 2012 in New Jersey, and sunk coastal residents into a nightmare of repetitive paperwork, confounding state bureaucracy, financial insecurity, and stress. Billions in disaster-relief aid â in grants administered by the state as well as flood insurance payouts â came to the state after the hurricane. But five years later, thousands are still out of their homes. Some are even living in their cars. So where did all that money go? Interviews with survivors, advocates, and government officials show the pattern: Settlements from the National Flood Insurance Program were far less than needed, rehabilitating or rebuilding homes was much more expensive than hoped, the bureaucracy was bewildering, unscrupulous contractors took advantage of peopleâs plight â and through it all they had to continue paying mortgages and rent. By now, the bulk of the 7,600 homeowners who received some of the $2.6 billion in public disaster rebuilding grants so far disbursed by New Jersey are taking elevators or climbing up to repaired and raised houses, state grants cashed, flood insurance premiums reduced. The state says 5,562 of the homeowners are all done; 1,200 are not back home. For others, like Kathy Culbertson Fisher, 51, of Ventnor, state-authorized repairs were head-scratching, rendering an entire floor of her house useless, dimensions skewed like a Dali painting. Sheâs waiting for final inspections to lower $3,000 flood premiums, and for final payments from the state. âWe started laughing a long time ago,â she said. âIf we donât, weâll go crazy.â Renters, in particular, are still saddled with difficulties, their belongings in storage, navigating rents that have spiked in Shore areas, bouncing around substandard units owned by difficult landlords. Sandy Relief Funds by Municipality Almost $5 billion in state and federal funds have been disbursed for Hurricane Sandy relief in New Jersey. Nearly $3.2 billion of that total have been sent to individual municipalities. The map shows municipalities that have received at least $100,000 in Sandy relief funds. Click on the map for totals by municipality. Note: Totals are comprised of funds from the following state and federal departments and agencies: âIâve been displaced,â said Candace McCray, 33, of Toms River, who was forced out of her rental home by mold. At a recent Sandy resource fair â the stateâs 13th such event â she was filling out affordable-housing applications. âIâve had a storage unit for over two years. Have you seen my car? Duffel bag, clothing. I stay where I can.â Sometimes, the only place she can stay is in that well-loaded car. Some are so frustrated, they plan to leave, if they ever get their homes ready for market. âThe grant is a joke and our mortgage company bought us flood insurance [that was] not FEMA-approved,â Patti Varallo, whose tidy Ventnor Heights home is still not finished, wrote on Facebook. Since this yearâs storms, battle-scarred Sandy groups are commiserating with Houstonites on the social-media site. âWhen I close the door here, I am never looking back!â Varallo vows. But from a policy perspective, not looking back is a luxury, especially as Houston, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands begin the recovery odyssey. What can be learned from the maddening maze that resulted after nearly $4.2 billion in federal funds was shoehorned into a state administrative model that dates to the Ford administration? And what about the lessons of a flood insurance program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency? That besieged program initially received $8.6 billion in claims from New Jersey residents, but left many without the resources to rebuild. As weather disasters increase nationwide, New Jerseyâs five-year-old storm stands as an example of just how perilous recovery can be â in so many ways. With all that disaster-relief money, why are people still living out of their cars? Critics say the stateâs early missteps hurt the most vulnerable, particularly renters and those already precarious financially. Legal settlements refocused state aid on Sandy-impacted areas and the needs of low-income people, and addressed bureaucratic snafus â but not until 2014. âThe delay has meant there are people who were basically permanently displaced,â said Adam Gordon, of the Cherry Hill-based Fair Share Housing Center, which won the landmark decision against the state. People canât wait years to make decisions on where their families would end up.â Those still in need now are grasping at diminishing resources. Janet Gattanella, who works in constituent services for the stateâs Department of Community Affairs, says her calls are more difficult than ever. âItâs become unmanageable,â she said. âThey need money to fill gaps that were unforeseen. We donât have any.â Contractor fraud, she said, derailed many in their recoveries. Michelle Griffith, 51, of Toms River, lost her footing after being forced from a Sandy-damaged rental in Queens, a small home seconds from the beach in Rockaway. She sought lower rents in Monmouth County, but a series of health setbacks and substandard apartments left the former executive secretary homeless for about three years, also living out of her car for a time. âI went into a depression,â she said, her constant companion Prince Milo, a 15-year-old Yorkshire terrier. Her current lease is up in December. âIâve been on waiting lists since 2014. The prices here are now like New York.â After several hours at the recent housing fair at Christ Episcopal Church in Toms River, she said she had good information, but ânot much hopeâ for assistance in the near future for a long-term solution. âStill hopefully looking,â she said. AMY S. ROSENBERG / Staff Michelle Griffith, 51, of Toms River, attends a state-sponsored housing fair for Sandy victims, nearly five years after the storm itself. She was a renter in Queens, became homeless, and lived out of her car for a time. What does the state say about its role in all this? It was the stateâs job to disburse the billions that flowed in from the federal government to those Sandy homeowners who needed help beyond their means and insurance. The state initially turned to a Louisiana company, Hammerman & Gainer Inc., awarding a $68 million contract that was terminated in early 2014 amid massive complaints about endless hoops, lost paperwork, and delays. Lisa Ryan, spokeswoman for the state Department of Community Affairs, says New Jersey âcompares favorablyâ to New York in the pace of spending. âRecovering from a storm as destructive as Superstorm Sandy â¦ takes time,â she wrote in an emailed response to questions. âCongress recognized this when it gave New Jersey and other states battered by Sandy until 2022 to spend [Community Development Block Grant] Disaster Recovery funds.â In the stateâs signature â and stress-inducing â Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Elevation, and Mitigation (RREM) program, nearly $925 million, about 92 percent, of allocated grants have been disbursed, she says. In addition to the 5,562 completed reconstructions, 840 homes are occupied while repairs are finished. Of the rest, she says about 900 of the 1,200 âanticipate completing construction by early 2018.â What about people who had insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program? Between the bureaucracy, the fly-by-night contractors, changing regulations, and, ultimately, much lower payouts than they expected, numerous survivors who thought their flood insurance would protect them are suffering from what they call Sandy Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The recovery process has left many of them emotionally drained, with pensions tapped and savings gone. They have lost money, peace of mind, sleep, and, at least in one case, a marriage. Some say they are better off now than before the storm â proud owners of flood-resistant homes that literally stand tall in their communities. But getting to that point was not something many would want to repeat. Amanda Devecke-Rinear, an author of the recent report by the New Jersey Resource Project, estimates up to 2,400 homeowners could still be out of their houses â despite having flood insurance. So what was the hang-up with FEMAâs role in flood insurance? FEMA administers the flood insurance program, though policies are sold through private companies. Initially, the federal agency received $8.6 billion in Sandy claims from New Jersey policyholders. But so many complained about getting lowball payments that FEMA notified all 144,400 flood insurance claimants that it would open a review for anyone who wanted it. As of Monday, FEMA had settled 17,212 of those claims. About 84 percent of homeowners received additional payments. About 16 percent received none. In all, FEMA has proposed $240 million in additional payouts to New Jersey policyholders. But others are still waiting â and frustrated. Kevin Sullivan, a FEMA spokesman, said the review was âan extraordinary effortâ and voluntarily initiated by the agency. It even created a âthird partyâ neutral review by those who werenât satisfied. âWe recognize this process has taken a significant amount of time â itâs taken too long â and we are working diligently to resolve these claims,â Sullivan said, noting that one of the delays has been in getting policyholders to supply all missing information. Is money still available to residents? The nearly $2.6 billion that has been disbursed comes out of $4.2 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funds sent to New Jersey by Congress. A separate category for National Disaster Recovery Funds shows just $45,000 disbursed out of $15 million allocated for longer-term resiliency projects. Ryan defended the building pace of affordable multifamily rental projects: In four rounds of funding, the state has allocated over $650 million to 76 such projects, she said. There are 45 completed projects that created 3,381 mostly low-to-moderate rental units. Of the rest, 21 projects are under construction, she said, with 2,667 rental units in the pipeline. AMY S. ROSENBERG / Staff A multifamily rental housing development is being built on Tennessee Avenue in Atlantic City, with priority for Sandy-impacted people. She added that 2,326 homeowners who needed help with rentals during construction received a total of $27.6 million, first through a federal Social Services block grant, and in 2017, from Community Development grants worth $12.5 million. Jim Rutala, a grants consultant in Atlantic County, said some funding programs require municipalities to apply. He recently submitted a request for money to elevate flood-prone houses from FEMAâs annual Flood Mitigation Program on behalf of 47 families identified by Atlantic City, Ventnor, and Brigantine. âWhat we found is that there are a lot of buckets of money that are still funding improvements that are needed from Sandy,â he said. Gordon, of Fair Share Housing, says money was properly targeted only after the successful legal action. âInitially, the state put about $170 million into that fund that overwhelmingly went to areas not impacted by the storm,â he said. âPart of the fair housing settlement set up benchmarks: 52 percent has to go to Monmouth and Ocean; 20 percent to Atlantic. The vast majority of that money since then went to those three counties. âIf they had done the right thing from the start, more of that money would be spent.â Why should anyone care if a bunch of rich Shore homeowners got stuck with big bills? First off, most of the homeowners in the flood insurance program are not rich. Some of the hardest-hit homes during Sandy were modest structures in working-class communities along back bays and other tidal areas â not oceanfront. âThese are not wealthy people,â says John Spodofora, mayor of Stafford Township, where the majority of waterfront homes were severely damaged. âI am dealing with abandoned homes. Iâm dealing with blight.â Stafford includes Manahawkin and is a gateway to wealthier oceanfront communities. Spodofora says only 65 percent of his community has been rebuilt. Many people living in less well-to-do areas did not even have flood insurance. Since the storm, many Sandy survivors have had to rent or live with relatives. They say theyâve still had to pay mortgages on their uninhabitable properties â those who didnât get rental assistance had that expense, too. U.S. Rep Tom MacArthur, who represents parts of Ocean County, says âitâs atrociousâ homeowners are still fighting for money. âThese people have been suffering for five years.â Many Sandy survivors say they simply feel forgotten. What is most infuriating to survivors? Clawbacks. Priscilla Robinson of the New Jersey Organizing Project, an advocacy group organized by Sandy survivors, said some people with little means are now facing what the group calls âclawbacksâ â requests from the government to refund money it feels they were not due. The New Jersey Resource Project said in a report released this month that about 20 percent of people who received up to $150,000 from the stateâs RREM grants were told they owe the state an average of $30,000. Nearly 90 percent said they were unable to pay back the money. Ryan, the state spokeswoman, said the giveback is required by the terms of the federal funding. So far, 443 homeowners who completed final grant reconciliation were required to pay back a total of $8.1 million. Of these, 237 have made at least a partial payment; about $3.19 million has been recovered. âDCA is attempting to recover ONLY funds that were not required to rebuild the home, duplicated another benefit that was received, or were used for ineligible expenses,â she wrote in an email. Could anyone have done better than Gov. Christie? Christieâs presidential ambitions were in high gear when Sandy struck. These crosswinds fueled a narrative for the governor that included a bipartisan embrace of President Obama. But they also may have led to curious allocations of money, such as for an $18 million senior center to a favored developer in Belleville, Essex County, which suffered little Sandy impact. Christie hired two controversial contracting companies with ties to the Republican Governors Association, a launchpad for his presidential run. One, overseeing RREM, the stateâs main recovery grant program, was ultimately let go. âHe just used Sandy as a prop,â said Jim Keady, the Monmouth County activist and Sandy victim famously told by Christie during a Sandy second anniversary event in Belmar to âsit down and shut up,â after Keady stood up and shouted, âDo your job!â âAnd he didnât finish the job,â said Keady, now running for Congress in New Jerseyâs Fourth District. Rutala, the grant consultant who has secured millions for towns, said the process simply takes time â decades, even. He has been instrumental in resiliency planning for Atlantic City, scoring tens of millions to rebuild damaged sections of the Boardwalk and seawall, restore historic floodgates, and create a city micro-grid impervious to future storms. He thinks a more centralized recovery would help. âIâm suggesting redeveloping neighborhoods so that theyâre resilient, and doing it in a comprehensive way, instead of house by house,â he said. âThereâs just so much waste in that. â Holly Leight, a former HUD director for New York and New Jersey, said unrealistic expectations were rampant, often reinforced by officials. âLack of clarity is, unfortunately, a hallmark of the informational scrum that occurs in the days, weeks, and months following most disasters,â she wrote in a recent report. The reality is that a housing recovery program can take as long as 18 months just to be established. âWe must do better than this â 18 months is a laughable gold standard,â she wrote. AMY S. ROSENBERG / Staff On Fairmount Street in Atlantic City, where flooding is a chronic problem, one house is up while the other is not, typical of many Sandy-hit neighborhoods. Nearby, the city has rebuilt historic Baltic Avenue floodgates that should ease nuisance flooding.
Search Listings: The City and the Storm The calm before the storm was much too calm, which should have been a clue. Forecasters had been talking about a potential Halloween hurricane�the Frankenstorm was its �headline-ready name�for two weeks. They thought it might be bigger than the hurricane of 1938; its barometric pressure was already a few ticks lower. The twist about this one, endlessly dissected, was that it was actually going to be two storms: Sandy would head north and encounter another weather system coming down from the northeast, a bank shot that would send the storm directly at New Jersey and a surge straight into the harbor, which is a natural funnel�New York’s own perfect storm. The subway was shut down early on Sunday night, more than 24 hours before expected landfall, and Mayor Bloomberg, a reborn weather alarmist after the 2010 blizzard, canceled school and told people to read a good book. Monday felt like Sunday on Seconal. For entertainment, we had breathless newscasters standing in puddles in their wet-weather gear, heralding the Storm of the Century that no one believed would really happen. �What preparations are you making?� asked an out-of-towner. �We have a lot of tea lights!� said the New Yorker, suggesting that anything more might be overkill. Outside, there was a gusting breeze, pulsing sheets of blowing spray. Inside was a flashlight, maybe some tuna and sardines, a disaster pantry left over, unused, from Irene. And then it started. It hit New York first out in the boroughs, a fourteen-foot surge pushing into the swampy lowlands of Staten Island, floating houses off their foundations, flooding people’s cars before they realized they were in danger. At Breezy Point, a fire had started at seven with the tide rising. In Red Hook, the water had crested the bank that afternoon, making no exceptions, swamping the housing projects and the Fairway and the artisans’ studios with six feet of water. Finally, Manhattan itself began to be submerged. Water poured over the esplanades that are one of Bloomberg’s most impressive legacies, swamping bodegas on the East Side, lapping the High Line on the West Side. At ground zero, 30 feet of water poured into the famous bathtub�submerging our last disaster. But that was only the beginning. Because then, the lights went out. Well, some of the lights. The city was sharply divided, zones of dark and light, a whole new demarcation of haves and have-nots. The line ran diagonally across the city, from 39th Street on the East Side to roughly 26th on the West. North and South quickly became two separate cities, one rich in power, the other suddenly, stunningly impoverished. And within the lower half, there were further new divisions. Those with cars (and means) could leave, the rest were stuck; some had gas burners, the rest ate their food cold; those with water towers had at least a few days with running water, others had to make do with hydrants. The drama of unequal division uncannily defined the crisis, just as it had an election year that was finally coming to an end. While Manhattan seemed to occupy center stage for much of the time, Sandy’s real sufferers were in the boroughs and New Jersey�Breezy Point, Staten Island, City Island, the Rockaways, the kinds of blue-collar places where most of the first responders came from, too. This was one of the many ways in which the event couldn’t help but bring memories of 9/11 to mind. The first major symbol of the storm was the collapse of the crane atop One57, the very well-hyped 90-story tower that was poised to be the most expensive residential building in the city, with a $90 million penthouse. Comeuppance perhaps, but the omens were mixed. The generators at NYU’s hospital flooded and failed, leaving doctors and nurses to carry patients down the stairs in near darkness; but the Goldman Sachs tower was a supernatural beacon of light in the midst of the storm. Who did they have to pay? was the obvious thought. When power was restored, Manhattan got it first, leaving many of the city’s suburbs in the cold. And yet most of Kings County woke up after the storm to full power, and Internet and cell-phone service, where lower Manhattan would be dark for days, which was just another reminder of Brooklyn’s ascendancy. For those without power, the days after Sandy were a strange interregnum, a kind of shadow life. It turned out that what we were waiting for right before the storm was � waiting, which was its own special kind of suffering. It was the calm after the storm, and calm is not why New Yorkers live here. Without electricity, the whole point of New York seemed to fray, then disappear. New Yorkers live with the illusion that you can do anything in the world that you might possibly want to do, even if in fact you may pass out on your couch. For the abruptly powerless, this faith was shaken�if a cup of coffee was a struggle, what else could you aspire to? And the absence of phones and Internet further cut our ties. In New York, many of us live partly vicariously. We’re image processors, symbol manipulators. Things that happen elsewhere are evaluated and reworked and sent back out. After the gusts, there was a sense of airlessness, which was the absence of information. Cell phones drained to 45 percent, then 37, then 8, a metric that augured the end of connection itself. �It’s almost like you’re dead,� said a downtowner. �The people are trying to contact you, but you’re beyond all that now.� With nowhere to go, the pace slowed down. Downtown was populated by walkers in groups of two to three, ambling like hayseeds�or extras in The Walking Dead�looking for an open deli, of which there were only a few, to be browsed in the dark with a flashlight. Suddenly, downtown was not the place to be. Because life was going on elsewhere. Uptown, they had lights and cell phones and coffee and web service and delis and restaurants. They could live like New Yorkers, like human beings. Rumors filtered down from this paradise, rubbing it in. But making the trek uptown could be disappointing. The borderland is not the most appealing of neighborhoods in the best of circumstances. But at the dividing line between darkness and light, residents of SoPo (newly coined, for South of Power) engaged in a hellish 10 a.m. scramble for coffee and bagels, or queued up in long lines for Korean-deli steam tables, as the morning patrons of Muldoon’s on Third Avenue had their smokes and watched. The most desperate search, of course, was for outlets to charge cell phones. A couple of days in, the always trendy Ace Hotel took pity on these poor refugees and ran power strips onto the sidewalk�attracting a kind of information breadline. In the West Village, people lined up with their phones on the waterfront, trying to catch a signal from New Jersey. A bit gallingly, downtown’s most foresighted and well-heeled swells had already relocated uptown. Graydon Carter and Anna Wintour, among others, were said to have taken up residence at the Mark; a lot of the younger crowd, led by Emma Watson, were at the Carlyle. Uptown was the new downtown. On Halloween Night, Bemelmans was packed. Lower Manhattan, rather than the ultimate destination, became a place to go through to get somewhere else, as the enormous traffic jams attested. Downtown was driveover country. At night, it seemed to be a natural landscape, a dark canyonland, gorgeous and lonely. As in all New York disasters, New Yorkers weren’t strangers anymore. Out surveying the damage with flashlights, people stopped to talk in tones of hushed amazement. Neighbors needed food and news. Just as with 9/11, the community of New York, always present, was brought into the open. In some ways, Sandy confirmed our communitarian values, underlining the importance of a government that makes a point of helping out�and that global warming was a problem to be dealt with. (Chris Christie even precipitously switched presidential-candidate best friends.) But no New Yorker can stay a sentimentalist too long. It didn’t take much time before the complaints and bickering began, and everything turned darker as the real misery became more apparent. The death toll kept rising as searchers pushed into the worst-hit areas�it stood at 100 people as of Friday�and some lost everything, over 100 houses in Breezy Point alone. And the city was not exactly overwhelmed with rescue workers and Red Cross trucks. Fury mounted with every hour that electricity and heat and food failed to arrive. In Alphabet City, in Red Hook, out in Staten Island, there were people who needed to fill buckets from hydrants, or scrounge from Dumpsters. By the end of the week, it was clear who was suffering and who had been merely inconvenienced. The news from the outer-boroughs was especially grim; people were fighting over gasoline; scenes from The Road. The images of water pouring into subways and banks, cars submerged on Avenue A, escalators that needed to be ridden with scuba equipment, brought to mind an apocalypse of a specific kind, another lost city�Atlantis. Was this what New York could become? It’s hard to remember, a decade after 9/11, how fragile downtown seemed then, and how long it struggled. But one of the many differences between that event and this one is that, for all the struggle, no one doubted for a moment in the months after 9/11 that New York was at the center of the world, which was a consolation, reinforcing the amour-propre that is a city hallmark. Out-of-towners were solicitous for years afterward. Whereas by Thursday of last week, Los Angelenos were already complaining about not getting their calls returned. One of the ways to look at a natural disaster is as a test, a challenge to be met, and by these measures, New York City was succeeding. By week’s end, normalcy was being returned�if not yet those L.A. phone calls. The arguing over the marathon was a healthy sign: not could we, but should we? The world should have such troubles. But for hundreds of years, the harbor had given New York its power. In less than 24 hours, it took it away. As we are reminded more and more often these days, it doesn’t take long to turn everything on its head.
Looking for news you can trust?Subscribe to our free newsletters. Some are calling it a “Snoreastercane.” Others have dubbed it a “Frankenstorm.” Whatever its nickname, Hurricane Sandy is bringing gale-force winds, flooding, heavy rains, and possibly even snow to the Eastern seaboard. UPDATE 21, 5:30 p.m. EDT, Thursday, November 1: Limited bus and subway service returned to New York City Thursday morning, but cars remained one of the only options for moving between boroughs. As a result, the streets of Brooklyn—which normally depends heavily on public transit—were overwhelmed with drivers, and they were all looking for one thing: gas. But the city’s main artery for this staple, the Port of New York, was closed during Hurricane Sandy and only just re-opened, leading to massive shortages, closed stations, and excruciating—and tense—lines for the pump. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Rick Ostfield of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, NY expressed concern about how the historic flooding has likely displaced hundreds or possibly thousands of rats, which could lead to the spread of rat-borne diseases: “You get infected individuals mixing with uninfected individuals and that’s a recipe for an outbreak.” People continue to take to Twitter to document the aftermath of the storm: The US death toll from Hurricane Sandy has now climbed to at least 50, including numerous victims killed by falling trees. Millions are still without power up and down the Eastern seaboard, including 684,000 in Manhattan. Con Ed officials called Sandy the worst storm in the company’s history. An explosion at a substation on the east side of Manhattan on Monday night led to the outages in Manhattan south of midtown. John Miksad, Con Ed’s senior vice president of electric operations, told the Wall Street Journal that the equipment is under several feet of water and operators are in rowboats working to pump it out, and that it could take up to a week to restore power to parts of Manhattan. Con Ed customers outside the city who lost power due to downed lines and trees may be without power for up to two weeks. The industry forecasting firm IHS Global Insight is estimating that the superstorm could cost up to $50 billion in damages and lost business. In Brooklyn, pedestrians are steering clear of standing water for fear of toxic sludge that could contain heavy metals and human waste. An apiary at the Brooklyn Navy Yard was destroyed, and 1 million honeybees were lost. A representative of the Brooklyn Grange, which managed 25 of the hives each containing about 40,000 bees, called the loss catastrophic. During a press conference this morning, Gov. Cuomo directly linked Hurricane Sandy to climate change, saying, “There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a political statement, that is a factual statement. Anyone who says there is not a dramatic change in weather patterns I think is denying reality.” There are many crazy storm photos popping up online–some legit, some fakes. They seem to be confusing many people; a friend working abroad says her colleagues keep asking her if there are really sharks swimming in the NYC subway system. In service to the public, both Buzzfeed‘s Katie Notopoulos and The Atlantic‘s Alexis Madrigal have posted great real-time fact-checking on some of the most unbelievable photos. Please check these out before tweeting any wild photos: “The federal government’s response has been great. I was on the phone at midnight again last night with the President, personally, he has expedited the designation of New Jersey as a major disaster area,” Christie, a top surrogate for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said on NBC’s “Today.” He added, “The President has been outstanding in this and so have the folks at FEMA.” On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Christie was equally laudatory, saying “the President has been all over this and he deserves great credit.” Obama, he said, “told me to call him if I needed anything and he absolutely means it, and it’s been very good working with the President and his administration.” UPDATE 14, 6:58 a.m. EDT, Tuesday, October 30: President Obama has issued a disaster declaration for New York and surrounding counties, USA Today reports, making federal aid available for those areas. In Bergen County, New Jersey, emergency responders are battling a levee breach that has reportedly sent several feet of water into three towns, and in Breezy Point, Queens, a six-alarm fire has destroyed nearly 60 homes. Up to 7 million are now without power; you can check which areas are blacked out on the Google Maps team’s Sandy map. The storm is expected to keep battering the East Coast all the way into Ontario, but winds are predicted to weaken through the day. UPDATE 13, 1:45 a.m. EDT, Tuesday, October 30: CNN tallies at least 13 US deaths so far; the New York Times reports “once-in-a-generation flooding.” Several sources say that a New York City ConEd plant exploded earlier this evening, causing massive power outages in lower Manhattan. Outlets are also reporting a large fire in the Breezy Point section of Brooklyn. In a statement early Tuesday morning, MTA chairman Joe Lhota said, “The New York City subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night.” Meanwhile, the National Weather Service predicts continuing high winds in New York and New England, more heavy rain in the mid-Atlantic, and 2-3 feet of snow in the mountains of West Virginia. UPDATE 12, 8:30 p.m. EDT, Monday, October 29: The water is starting to recede at New York City’s Battery Park, but the worst dangers of the storm may still be ahead. New York University Hospital lost power and has had to begin evacuating patients. Since many patients at the hospital are in poor health and some are on ventilators, the evacuation is very dangerous. (WYNC’s Fred Mogul reported that the hospital’s backup generator failed.) The New York Fire Department has tweeted that firefighters are on the scene at Coney Island hospital and there is no fire, despite earlier reports. There are unconfirmed reports of trouble at other area hospitals. The Metropolitan Transit Authority has confirmed that there is water in the subway tunnels under the East River—an event that the New York Timesreported in September could be a $55 billion disaster. Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the MTA, told the Weather Channel on Monday night that it would take a “significant amount of time” to get subways running again. And Long Island is now completely cut off from the mainland: all bridges and tunnels are closed. Check out this time lapse video from the Climate Desk of the Manhattan skyline awaiting Sandy: Climate Desk’s James West took to his Brooklyn rooftop to talk with his home country’s national breakfast radio show to describe what he was seeing across the city, and how he was preparing for something that might last days and days. Listen here. People continue to take to Twitter and Instagram to document the storm. According to Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom, “There are now 10 pictures per second being posted with the #sandy – most are images of people prepping for the storm and images of scenes outdoors.” Reporting from Brooklyn, Climate Desk Producer James West and Climate Desk Fellow Tim McDonnell spoke with people who were planning on staying in areas like Red Hook that have mandatory evacuations, “recalling what they thought were over-hyped precautions during last year’s Hurricane Irene disaster.”In Red Hook, a neighborhood along New York Harbor featuring low-lying land and industrial piers, sandbags weren’t enough to prevent flooding, not just of seawater but also curious tourists, locals and television vans. James West UPDATE 10, 4:15 P.M. EDT, Monday, October 29: The Coast Guard today posted this video of the harrowing rescue of 14 people from life rafts from the sunken HMS Bounty, 90 miles off the coast of Hatteras, N.C. Two people remain missing. The HMS Bounty sent out a distress beacon early this morning. The 14 people were flown to Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., where they were met by awaiting emergency medical services personnel with no life threatening injuries. Coast Guard helicopters continue to search for the two missing crewmembers. A girl with “snazzy new rainboots” on the East River at 18th Street in Manhattan posted a video shot at 11 a.m. EST of the East River overflowing its bank as an NYPD officer announces over a bullhorn that the area is a mandatory evacuation zone. An ominous NASA video shows the storm gathering steam as it approaches New York City, displaying the massive scale of the storm which has already broken the record for being the largest storm in recorded Atlantic basin history. People all up and down the East Coast have been posting their photos (real and, uh, less real, like the one above) to Twitter of the flooding and storm surge encroaching upon the landscape. According to the National Weather Service, “Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph are expected by 8 am this morning, then increasing around noon to 35 to 45 mph with hurricane force wind gusts 60 to 70 mph lasting into early Tuesday morning.” The New York Times has created an interactive map to help New Yorkers figure out whether or not they need to evacuate. Mother Jones’ Adam Serwer analyzes how Hurricane Sandy could swing the 2012 election, concluding that if it “turns out to be as bad as the meteorologists fear, it could have a real impact.” Mike Ryan, senior writer at Huffington Post Entertainment, tweets out a photo of FDR Drive in New York underwater: UPDATE 7, 10:00 p.m. EDT, Sunday, October 28: Cities from Washington to Boston were ordering mass evacuations on Sunday night and public school was cancelled for all of New York City, Boston, Washington, Baltimore, and many of their suburbs. Airlines canceled more than 5,000 flights, and Amtrak began suspending train service across the Northeast. President Obama today reviewed emergency response plans with FEMA administrator Craig Fugate in advance of what the president has called a “serious and big storm.” He urged residents in the path of the storm to heed the warnings and directions of their local emergency officials and to leave their homes if evacuation is deemed necessary. A high-wind warning will go into effect Monday at 6 a.m. (EDT) for New York City, with gusts expected to reach 80 mph. People living in the strike zone, especially those in high rise buildings above the 10th floor, are warned to stay away from windows as flying debris could pose a threat. The National Guard has called upon 61,000 troops to prepare for storm response. UPDATE 6, 3:00 p.m. EDT, Sunday, October 28: Sandy is threatening to bring significant storm surge flooding to Long Island Sound and New York Harbor with winds near hurricane force at landfall, according to the Sunday afternoon bulletin from NOAA which was tracking the hurricane about 270 miles off the coat of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina. Heavy snow is also forecast in the Appalachian Mountains. The death toll in the Caribbean is up to 65. Already hundreds of flights have been canceled and mass transit systems are shutting down all along the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in advance of the storm which is supposed to make landfall in Southern New Jersey by late Monday or early Tuesday. With just over a week before the election, President Obama has scrapped campaign plans for Monday and Tuesday to focus on storm response, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney has been scrambling his schedule, canceling events in Virginia and joining running mate Paul Ryan in Ohio. For those in the path of the hurricane looking for infomation, the Red Cross has a Hurricane App which will allow users to monitor conditions in their area or throughout the storm track, prepare their family and home, find help and let others know they are safe even if the power is out. UPDATE 4, 1:00 p.m. EDT, Saturday, October 27: Early Saturday morning, Sandy was briefly downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, but hurricane strength winds were observed a few hours later. According to an update from NOAA at 11 am EST, tropical storm watches and warnings for the east coast of Florida have been discontinued, but they are in effect for areas in South and North Carolina, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph and the storm is expected to move parallel to the southeastern coast of the US throughout the weekend. Gale force winds, storm surge, and rainfall from four to eight inches are likely to reach the Mid-Atlantic coast by Sunday evening. Some are predicting that Sandy will make landfall in Delaware on Tuesday, and Maine, New Jersey, and Connecticut have joined North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, D.C., Pennsylvania and New York in declaring a state of emergency. According to the NY Daily News, city officials are considering evacuating 375,000 New Yorkers and three to six feet of water could be seen in subways in a worst cast scenario. AccuWeather senior meteorologist Henry Margusity warned MarketWatch, “There will be school closures, travel will be messed up for days and major airports will be closed. This could be a disaster of biblical proportions – a multi-billion dollar disaster.” UPDATE 2, 2:45 p.m. EDT, Friday, October 26: The latest weather models show Sandy on a collision course with the mid-Atlantic and Northeast with 50 million people in its projected path. The Capitol Weather Gang at the Washington Post is predicting a one-in-three chance of a direct hit on New York City, in which case city officials may call for evacuations as a storm surge could flood parts of Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Many are freaking out about this storm. On his blog, Accuweather meterologist Mike Smith quoted a “prominent National Weather Service meteorologist” as saying: I’ve never seen anything like this and I’m at a loss for expletives to describe what this storm could do. The National Hurricane Center says Sandy is moving slowly due north at about six mph with wind speeds of up to 80 mph and are calling the storm a hybrid with tropical characteristics. Eric Holthaus, contributing meteorologist at the Wall Street Journal, said a midwestern snow storm is currently generating over the Great Lakes and will pull the hurricane inland. The full moon on Monday could play a role in coastal flooding, bringing higher tides. He said a direct strike on New York City might actually be a better scenario than if the storm hits in Southern Jersey as it is currently forecasted to do. Coastal flooding could bring a storm surge between six to 10 feet in the city in a worst-case scenario, he said. The financial markets, utilities, and the tourism industry are also bracing for impact with storm damage estimates already predicted at upwards of $1 billion. UPDATE 1, 1:10 p.m. EDT Friday, October 26: During a teleconference call on Friday morning, James Franklin, branch chief of NOAA’s National Hurricane Center, predicted that the coastline from Florida up through through North Carolina will experience peripheral impacts from Sandy through Sunday, and that the storm will move north to Virginia through New England Monday through Wednesday. The expectation is that the storm will move slowly and there will be two or three days of impacts for many people. According to Dr. Louis Uccellini, director of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction, the West Virginia and Appalachian area could potentially get one to two feet of snow, and there is likely a risk of river flooding in Delaware and Pennsylvania. New York City may experience tropical storm force winds as well as flash flooding. “Someone is going to get a significant surge event out of this, much broader than Irene,” said Franklin. It’s possible, according to AccuWeather. They suspect that as the storm batters the east coast at the end of this week and into next week, early voting may seem less appealing to those planning on heading to the polls. Several of the states that might be hit by the storm, such as Florida, Maryland, D.C., Vermont, and Maine, allow for in-person early voting. According to AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno, “The worst case scenario is that if this storm does go up into New England…we could see lots of power outages, we could see flooding. That could have an impact even a week later, depending on how bad the storm is.” A recent survey conducted by the Weather Channel showed that 35 percent of undecided likely voters would be less inclined to head to the polls if there is bad weather on Election Day. Possibly. NOAA scientists have shied away from blaming human activities and climate change outright on the more active hurricane seasons in recent years. However, they do say that anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause hurricanes globally to be more intense on average.Forecasters have also said warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures and wind patterns that favor storm formation mean chances are higher for an above-normal season.

Site Mobile Navigation Recovery Is Slower in New York Suburbs Jessica Libert and her niece Madilynn Rice, 2, survey the flood damage on Croft Place in Staten Island.Credit Michael Kirby Smith for The New York Times Tropical Storm Irene swept through the desolate streets of New York on Sunday, flooding low-lying areas and leaving millions of homes without power along the Eastern Seaboard as it continued on to New England . Most New Yorkers emerged from their makeshift bunkers to find little of the widespread devastation the authorities had feared. But the aftermath of the storm, at least in New York and its suburbs, could be most felt on Monday in the early-morning commute -- which, for some people, was a nonstarter. Although most of the city subway’s 22 lines were running by 6 a.m. on Monday, the experience could not be more different outside the city, where fallen trees and downed wires caused problems throughout suburban New York and Connecticut. There was no service whatsoever on the Metro-North Railroad, and no commuter service into New York on New Jersey Transit. The Long Island Rail Road had extremely limited train service; Amtrak was not running any trains between Boston and Philadelphia, and service between New York and Albany was also stopped. PATH trains did resume on Monday; New Jersey Transit buses also were running on a truncated weekday schedule. But for many suburban commuters, getting to New York meant doing something out of their normal routine: taking ferries, commuter vans or finding instant car pool partners. The storm, which was downgraded from a hurricane shortly before it hit New York, attacked in a flurry of punches. A police station in Cranford, N.J., flooded and had to be evacuated. Firefighters paddling in boats rescued more than 60 people from five-foot floodwaters on Staten Island . New York’s major airports were closed, and at least five storm-related deaths were reported in New York State and New Jersey . But after wide-ranging precautionary measures by city officials that included shutting down New York’s mass-transit network, sandbagging storefronts on Fifth Avenue and issuing evacuation orders for 370,000 people across the city, Hurricane Irene is likely to be remembered by New Yorkers more for what did not happen than for what did. Windows in skyscrapers did not shatter. Subway tunnels did not flood. Power was not shut off pre-emptively. The water grid did not burst. There were no reported fatalities in the five boroughs. And the rivers flanking Manhattan did not overrun their banks . Still, when the center of the storm arrived over New York City , about 9 a.m., winds had reached 65 miles per hour, making Irene the largest storm to hit the city in more than 25 years, even as the bulk of the storm’s power was reserved for the suburbs. “All in all, we are in pretty good shape because of the exhaustive steps I think we took to prepare for whatever came our way,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. Before striking New York, the storm left a path of wreckage that killed at least 16 people in six states, paralyzed most modes of transportation across the Northeast and caused flooding in several states. “Many Americans are still at risk of power outages and flooding,” President Obama said, “which could get worse in the coming days as rivers swell past their banks.” New York’s economic costs have yet to be calculated, but with Broadway dark, storefronts covered in plywood and virtually the entire population shuttered indoors, the weekend’s lost sales and storm damage could end up costing the city about $6 billion, said Peter Morici, a business school professor at the University of Maryland . The total national cost could reach $40 billion, Mr. Morici added. Outside New York City, the storm’s wrath was stark. In New Jersey, more than 800,000 customers were without power on Sunday, and the state’s largest utility, Public Service Electric and Gas, estimated it could take a week to restore electricity to all of its customers. In Connecticut , 670,000 customers had lost power — roughly half the state — which surpassed power failures caused by Hurricane Gloria in 1985. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said more than 300 roadways were blocked, but he warned that dire problems were still to come, particularly along the Delaware , Ramapo and Passaic Rivers. “The real issue that we are going to have to deal with now is flooding,” Mr. Christie said. Flooding in Philadelphia reached levels that had not been seen in that city in more than 140 years. Vermont was also struck particularly hard; even as the worst of the winds had dissipated, flooding forced officials to evacuate parts of southern Vermont, and floods were expected in the northern portion of the state as late as Monday. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said it could take a week to fully restore power to the 750,000 customers without electricity. That included 457,000 on Long Island , 50,000 in Westchester County and 34,000 in Queens , officials said. Consolidated Edison said power was not cut in Manhattan. Mr. Obama said that though the storm had not proved as strong as many feared, the aftermath would be substantial. “The impacts of this storm will be felt for some time,” he said Sunday from the White House. “And the recovery effort will last for weeks or longer. I want people to understand that this is not over.” An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. But despite the lack of power, flooding and foiled weekend plans, the soggy Northeast’s collective mood shifted Sunday from dread to relief. In New York, joggers, not floodwaters, were spotted along the East River. Restaurants, bookstores and bars reopened. Traffic picked up, and officials at the United States Open announced that the tournament would begin on Monday after all. By 11 a.m., with the sun peeking out, tourists flocked to Central Park even though police officers shooed them away for fear of falling branches. “I slept like a baby,” said Steven Boone, a homeless man who rode out the storm in a shelter in the East Village. “Nowhere near as bad as I thought.” “I would make the same decisions again without hesitation,” he said. “We’re just not going to take any risk with people’s lives, and the best scenario possible is you take the precautions and it turns out they’re not needed.” The city lifted a highly unusual evacuation order of low-lying neighborhoods a day after residents of Zone A — including Coney Island, the Rockaways and Battery Park City — were ordered to leave for their own safety. (The city’s zoned labels showed signs of outlasting the storm’s more tangible effects. Viktoriya Gaponski, a fashion blogger, said on Twitter that she planned to “only date Zone B men from now on. Less dangerous than Zone A, but edgier than Zone C.”) The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reopened the city’s three major airports on Monday morning. The storm caused several deaths in the region, including at least three in New Jersey. Celena Sylvestri, 20, was driving to her boyfriend’s house when she was caught in flood waters in Salem County. Ms. Sylvestri called police to say she was trapped in water up to her neck, but by the time rescue workers found her, eight hours later, she was already dead inside her car. In Buena Vista, N.J., in Atlantic County, officials scrambled to evacuate three dozen elderly residents from trailer homes that were threatened by sudden flooding. The police also said a 39-year-old volunteer rescue worker for Princeton Township’s Rescue and First Aid squad was in critical condition on Sunday after he was injured while trying to make a rescue in swift-moving water at 4:30 a.m. There were close calls in New York City, as well. In the Bulls Head section of Staten Island, dozens of people stood on their nearly submerged porches to flag down firefighters who took them to safety in their rafts. The flood waters had swallowed rows of parked cars, angering at least one resident. In Brooklyn on Sunday afternoon, bars flung open their windows and sidewalk cafes set up outdoor tables as businesses and patrons looked to make up for a lost Saturday night. The Greenlight Bookstore in Fort Greene said it was packed less than 10 minutes after opening around 2:30 p.m. Across the street, Habana Outpost served margaritas and planned to play a movie outdoors as long as the weather cooperated. Others found poetry in the gales of wind and sheets of rain. “You may not see this again in your lifetime,” said Teddy Ferris, 55, an East Village resident who had refused to evacuate and had taken a seat along the East River on Sunday morning. “This is beautiful. This is nature at its best.” A version of this article appears in print on August 29, 2011, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: New York Spared Brunt of Storm; Suburbs Hit Hard.

Search form Main menu You are here Hurricane Sandy: DOT Year in Review In the year since Hurricane Sandy, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has been coordinating closely with its state and federal partners to speed the restoration of transportation systems in affected states, while working to ensure that the new infrastructure is built to withstand future storms. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, DOT, with its partners and other federal agencies, worked to ensure fast, efficient transport of power sources, fuel, and supplies to speed Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. Hurricane Sandy triggered one of the worst transportation disasters in U.S. history, but DOT continues to stand ready to help the region move forward to complete its recovery and strengthen its resiliency, so that taxpayers are not asked to repair the same infrastructure a second or third time. Under the direction of President Obama, the Administration has worked to cut red tape and build on lessons learned from previous disasters to help families get back in their homes; get small businesses back on their feet; and help communities rebuild their critical infrastructure. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx meeting with workers at a transit reconstruction site in Brooklyn. Immediate Response DOT played an instrumental role positioning assets leading up to the storm’s impact, and recovering immediately after. In the first days following the storm, DOT made available more than $29 million to impacted states and administered a host of waivers, special permits, and other regulatory flexibilities to speed the delivery of materials and rebuilding efforts. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved $29 million in emergency relief funds for states to use in rebuilding roads, bridges, seawalls and tunnels in the immediate days after the storm. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) worked closely with FEMA and GSA to secure as many as 350 buses to replace lost commuter rail and transit service in New Jersey. Within days of the storm hitting, FTA was on the ground with FEMA to assess damage to transit agencies and to determine what kinds of projects should be eligible for reimbursement. FTA quickly set up funding categories to help local transit agencies file for aid for eligible expenses. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and FHWA worked with the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHTO) to cut through red tape to expedite the permitting process for carriers moving temporary mobile housing units from Maryland and Alabama to New Jersey. FHWA worked with states to allow nighttime moves, which are normally prohibited. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) worked directly with Amtrak and freight rail carriers in the Northeast Corridor as they assessed damage, facilitated recovery efforts and planned to resume service. Four of the six tunnels that carry Amtrak trains under the East and Hudson Rivers were left flooded by Sandy- all four were reopened by November 9. Working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) provided FEMA with several nearby ships to provide lodging, food, and power for emergency response teams who had traveled to New York. The Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) helped speed the transport of hazardous materials, including much-needed fuel, to and from hurricane disaster areas with fast tracked emergency special permits. Recovery Funding In the past year, DOT has obligated $1.3 billion across four operating administrations to support recovery and resiliency projects. FTA has allocated $5.7 billion to all affected transit agencies for Sandy recovery activities and for anticipated resiliency projects. FTA also worked expediently to develop a new emergency relief program to facilitate federal assistance for public transportation systems. In New York, the Montague tunnel carries 65,000 customers each weekday on the R train and was flooded with more than 27 million gallons of salt water. FTA is covering 90% of the $262.4 million project cost, with $56.4 million dedicated to resiliency work. FHWA has provided $586 million in emergency relief funding to states and federal lands impacted by Sandy, including Liberty Island, which was open in time for Independence Day after crews worked tirelessly to replace the docks, all of which were destroyed by the storm. FRA provided $30.2 million to Amtrak to repair damage caused by Hurricane Sandy along its heavily-traveled Northeast Corridor. FAA has allocated $28.5 million in emergency relief funding to states impacted by Sandy to repair critical FAA infrastructure. Resiliency Projects FRA is providing $185 million in relief funding to the Hudson Yards Right-of-Way Preservation project to help pave the way for two flood-resistant tunnels under the Hudson River, between New York and New Jersey. The project will ensure greater resiliency against future super storms and disasters, as well as allow service in the nation’s busiest commuter corridor to continue uninterrupted while long-term repairs are completed on either of the existing century-old tunnels that now connect New York and New Jersey. Through FHWA’s Federal Lands Program, the replacement docks and boardwalks at Fire Island National Seashore and Gateway National Recreation Area were designed to tolerate being submerged by using stronger piles and hurricane ties. FTA has made available $1.3 billion to increase transit systems’ resiliency in the face of future disasters. In New York, storm drains were elevated to reduce the volume of water that pours into stations below street level, higher capacity water pumps and back-up sources of power for lighting, flood pumps and other necessities were installed. The hardest hit transit agencies in New York and New Jersey will use this funding to upsize pumps and raise interlocking signals in flood prone areas and develop infrastructure to allow additional drainage.
Christie Declares State Of Emergency; Orders Evacuations In Some Parts Of N.J. SEA BRIGHT, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has declared a state of emergency in advance of the Hurricane Sandy “Frankenstorm,” and has ordered evacuations for many areas. Christie said the Barrier Islands, from Sandy Hook South to Cape May, will be under a mandatory evacuation order by 4 p.m. Sunday. The Atlantic City casinos will also be under an evacuation order by no later than 4 p.m., and national parks must be evacuated by noon. Christie said no one should be “cynical” about the forecasts, and everyone should prepare for the worst. “We should not underestimate the impact of this storm, and we should not assume our predictions will be wrong,” Christie said. “I’m not trying to be an alarmist here. I want everyone to be ready. I want your families to be safe and I want us to be able to do our jobs the right way.” Evacuation centers will be open for all those in need, he said. Also, everyone around the state should prepare for power outages of up to 10 days, he said. Those on the shoreline who are not on the Barrier Islands should consider voluntary evacuation, Christie said. New Jersey state police Col. Rick Fuentes said tropical storm-force winds of 40 to 70 mph will blow statewide, and hurricane-force winds will be blowing along the shoreline. Fuentes reminded anyone subject to an evacuation order to obey. First responders will also be seeking shelter once tropical storm-force winds begin blowing, and may not be available for rescues. Once tropical storm-force winds are blowing, first responders will also be taking shelter, Fuentes said. “You should prepare for at least two to three days of harsh conditions starting overnight on Sunday,” Fuentes said. Eastern-bound roads to the Barrier Islands will be closed after 4 p.m. Sunday. While people are urged to stay off the roads, no other closures were planned as of midday Saturday, Christie said. Tolls will be suspended on the northbound side of the Garden State parkway and westbound Atlantic City Expressway starting at 6 a.m. on Sunday to facilitate the evacuation of coastal areas in advance of Hurricane Sandy. On Saturday afternoon, owners of many stores facing the ocean were already boarding up. Rachel at Adrenaline Fitness in Sea Bright said that business was closing down. “We’re going to close just to be safe Monday through Wednesday, unless the storm passes us, then we’ll be open.” During major storms, the ocean and the river meet and the entire town is left underwater, 1010 WINS’ Gary Baumgarten reported. In some areas, voluntary evacuations began ahead of time. As CBS 2’s Amy Dardashtian reported, the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy has the potential of decimating not only the Jersey Shore, but several low-lying areas that are prone to flooding are also at risk. Hurricane Sandy is expected to make landfall late Monday night, but violent winds and torrential rain could move in as soon as Sunday evening. Current models indicated Saturday morning that landfall would be close to Atlantic City, but it could be anywhere between the Virginia coastline and Long Island. Sea Bright councilman C. Reed Murphy, who works for the Office of Emergency Management, began tracking the storm at the beginning of the day Saturday. He said he expected the storm to be “extremely serious.” “I think you’re going to see high winds, extreme flooding, more than one tide,” Murphy said. “This is not like a hurricane. It’s going it be a sustained storm. It’s going to sit here for a little while.” Murphy has been tracking storms since the 1980s, but he expects the Hurricane Sandy Frankenstorm to be the worst since well before that. “This is only my opinion, but I think this is going to be worse than anything I’ve seen, and I’ve seen storms here back into the 60s,” he said. “We went through a chain of storms in the 80s and two in the 90s. Just the wind gradient — this is so large, and you’re going from a tropical situation joining up with a front that’s sitting to the west of here.” All morning in Sea Bright, crews were pushing up sand along the shoreline. But shopkeepers were taking no chances, choosing to board up their businesses. As Sandy approached, Sea Bright, resident Brian George was using lessons learned from Irene to safeguard his store, hauling sand from the beach to make sandbags to block the water. “Last time, it went up about 1 1/2 feet,” George said. He expects flooding from the ocean on one side, and from a river on the other. “When you move to Sea Bright, you know what you’ve got,” George said. While Saturday was shaping up to be labor-intensive for some, others were waiting to see the storm’s progression before getting worried. But even those who live on higher ground had a plan – be it backup batteries, extra water or a “go-bag.” Some had already begun evacuating voluntarily across the shore. But fisherman Steve Smith said he doesn’t plan to evacuate unless he absolutely has to, and said he finds the storm exciting. “We like to watch the waves and the ocean,” he said. But officials warn it can be serious and dangerous, and people along the Jersey Shore know that feeling well. “Once the river starts to go, this brook here will fill, and when that fills, we’re in trouble,” one resident said. The devastating effects of Hurricane Irene left a lasting impression on the Jersey Shore. Jersey Central Power & Light, which was criticized for its response to Irene, notified employees to be ready for extended shifts. Public Service Electric and Gas was monitoring Sandy and stepping up emergency preparations. The utility requested more than 1,300 linemen and 600 tree contractors from utilities in other states for assistance. Officials in Belmar were pumping water into the ocean from Silver Lake and Lake Como, a move residents like Ann Murphy hope will save their homes if Hurricane Sandy comes close. In low-lying Little Falls, N.J., the Passaic River was a concern. Officials warned that if evacuations were ordered, residents abide by them or it may be hard to get out afterwards. In other parts of New Jersey flooding from a reservoir was a major concern. Pompton Lakes residents told CBS 2’d Derricke Dennis that they were moving furniture off of the first floor of their home to save it from being ruined. “I’m hoping it’s all for naught, but no sense taking a chance,” said Jerry DeMarsico. Transportation hubs such as Newark Penn Station expect delays and cancellations come Monday. “What we would encourage our customers to do is to, number one, have a plan think ahead, to see what would happen if there was an interruption, number two, to monitor news outlets,” said NJ TRANSIT spokesman John Durso Jr. Officials are advising area residents to stock up about 10 days of supplies, and to heed evacuation warnings.
Hoboken After Hurricane Sandy HOBOKEN, N.J. — New Jersey was reeling on Wednesday from the impact of Hurricane Sandy, which has caused catastrophic flooding here in Hoboken and in other New York City suburbs, destroyed entire neighborhoods across the state and wiped out iconic boardwalks in shore towns that had enchanted generations of vacationgoers. Though the storm raged up the East Coast, it has become increasingly apparent that New Jersey took the brunt of it. Officials estimated that the state suffered many billions of dollars in property damage. More than two million customers remained without power on Wednesday, about half of those in the state. More than 6,000 people were still in shelters, state emergency officials said. At least eight people died, and officials expressed deep concerns that the toll would rise as more searches of homes were carried out. On Wednesday, President Obama visited the state and viewed the destruction with Gov. Chris Christie. “The entire country has been watching what’s been happening,” Mr. Obama said at a stop in Atlantic County at the Brigantine Beach Community Center in Brigantine. “Everybody knows how hard Jersey has been hit.” Perhaps as startling as the sheer toll was the devastation to some of the state’s well-known locales. Boardwalks along the beach in Seaside Heights, Belmar and other towns on the Jersey Shore were blown away. Amusement parks, arcades and restaurants all but vanished. Bridges to barrier islands buckled, preventing residents from even inspecting the damage to their property. Localities across New Jersey imposed curfews to prevent looting. In Monmouth, Ocean and other counties, people waited for hours for gasoline at the few stations that had electricity. Supermarket shelves were stripped bare. Photo People used improvised plastic bags to navigate flood waters in Hoboken.Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times Two days after Hurricane Sandy struck, such distress was not limited to New Jersey. Others parts of the Northeast, including Long Island, also suffered significant losses. Over all, the death toll from the storm passed 60, officials said Wednesday, and about six million people did not have power. One of the most pressing crises was unfolding here in Hoboken, a city of 50,000 that is directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan. “This is flooding like we’ve never seen,” said Mayor Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, where National Guard troops on Wednesday were trying to rescue thousands of residents trapped by sewage-laced floodwaters. “It filled the city like a bathtub,” she said. When the storm surge hit on Monday night, the Hudson overcame the sea wall at the north and south ends of the city in a devastating westward torrent that made an island of the slightly higher, eastern half of the city. After Ms. Zimmer appealed for aid on Tuesday, saying that as many as 20,000 people could be stuck in their homes, the first National Guard trucks arrived just before midnight. Overnight, they responded to emergency messages to find people and transport them to dry ground. On the city’s Facebook page, officials called on residents in need to listen for the trucks’ approach. By midday on Wednesday, 12 National Guard trucks and two Humvee vehicles were in Hoboken for the rescue effort. City officials have not reported any fatalities in Hoboken so far. Photo An aerial view of storm damage on the Atlantic coast.Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Among the first to be rescued during the night were two babies, one 5 days old and another 3 weeks old. By midday Wednesday, the trucks at the unloading point by City Hall were bringing older people, including several in wheelchairs, and many families with babies and small children. Robyn Pecarsky, who was eight months pregnant, was helped down from the back of a truck with her two children, who are 5 and 8. “We saw the National Guard, and I sent my husband to tell them he had to get his pregnant wife out,” Ms. Pecarsky said. She said the family lived in a third-floor apartment on Jackson Street that was not damaged, but as of this morning the water remained at thigh-high level on the ground floor of the building. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. She said that the children had been in the house under the curfew since Monday, and that nerves were raw. When she heard that power, which remained out in much of Hoboken, might not return for days, she decided that the family had to leave. City officials were worried because the floodwaters are a brew of rain and river water mixed with sewage, Ms. Zimmer said. A sewage plant on the west side of the city had been overwhelmed in the flood, she said. Many power lines were down on the largely residential west side. Although power remained out in many parts of the city, there was concern that some fallen wires might remain active. Photo Nick Parise, from Edgewater, N.J., gave a lift to Carley Keefe, front, and Caitlin Schell in Hoboken, N.J.Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times The PATH train station, on the south end of the city, remained closed after water from the Hudson rushed in Monday night. Port Authority officials said the PATH tunnel under the river was filled with water. Many commuters use the system to get to work in Manhattan. Interviewed in the basement of City Hall, where rescue officials in a makeshift operations center were down to one working phone line on Tuesday, the mayor said the city had only a single pump station on the south end of town to drain its streets and, eventually, its basements. In Sayreville, across Raritan Bay from Staten Island, the foundations of several homes were washed away, following the rush of a five-foot surge that had marooned some 200 people who were rescued, mostly by boat. Mr. Christie visited the area, and several women cried in his arms as they told him how much they had lost. The governor alternatively embraced them, put his hands on both shoulders and spoke softly with an arm around their backs. “I don’t feel safe in my house and I don’t know what to do,” said one of them, Elaine Konopka. As the governor walked down the street, he approached several people who wanted to show him their homes. “Please help us,” Theresa Mills said. “That’s what I’m here to do,” he responded. Correction: November 2, 2012 Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the devastation in New Jersey caused by Hurricane Sandy misstated the extent of power failures. Officials said more than two million customers — not people — lost power in the storm. (That total is about half the number of customers in the state.) An accompanying picture caption repeated the error and also misidentified the flooded area shown. The destruction was in Mantoloking, N.J., not in Seaside Heights.

How Hurricanes Damage the Economy Why Harvey, Irma, Maria and Other Hurricanes Are So Destructive ••• Andrew White (L) helps a neighbor down a street after rescuing her from her home in his boat in the upscale River Oaks neighborhood after it was inundated with flooding from Hurricane Harvey on August 27, 2017 in Houston, Texas. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Hurricanes are the most damaging natural disasters. They are perilous for the people living in their paths and for the national economy. A Category 4 or 5 hurricane can lower U.S. production and increase unemployment. It can raise gas prices to $5 a gallon. It can also depress the stock market and other financial markets. That includes 72 of its ports, 27 percent of its major roads, and 9 percent of its rail lines. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 1.2 million Americans live in coastal areas at risk of “substantial damage” from hurricanes. The CBO defines that as damage of at least 5 percent of average income. Most of this densely populated area lies less than 10 feet above sea level, according to the National Hurricane Center. The federal government pays for 60 percent of hurricane damage. Most of that comes from three agencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency pays almost two-thirds of the government's bill. The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pay a little more than a third. State and local governments, insurance, and private individuals pay the rest. 2018 Hurricane Season The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration said the 2018 season could be worse than average. It predicted a 70 percent likelihood there may be 10 to 16 named storms. Five to nine of them could become hurricanes. One to four of those could turn into major hurricanes of Category 3 or above. Most homes in the hurricanes' paths are still underinsured. 2017 Hurricane Season The 2017 hurricane season was particularly harsh. A high pressure system kept the northeast in summery temperatures through September. It also kept cooler winds from Canada out of the region. Those winds usually drive hurricanes out to sea. Another high pressure system developed around Bermuda. That sent hurricanes right into Florida and the U.S. east coast. Hurricane Irma was the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. Damage was $50 billion. Accuweather estimated total cost to the economy at $100 billion. It was a Category 5 storm when it made landfall on Barbuda on September 6, 2017. Its winds were 185 miles per hour for 37 hours, a new record. It was downgraded to a Category 4 before it hit the Florida Keys on September 10. That was the first time in 100 years that two storms Category 4 or larger hit the U.S. mainland in the same year. President Trump declared emergencies in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Congress appropriated $35.5 billion in emergency funding. Of that, $16 billion is debt forgiveness for the National Flood Insurance Program. Harvey damaged 200,000 homes, of which 12,700 were destroyed. More than 500,000 people asked for federal assistance. The storm forced 5 percent of the nation's oil and gas production to shut down. Gas prices rose from $2.35 a gallon before Harvey hit to $2.49 a gallon. How Hurricanes Cause Damage Hurricane damage occurs from seven sources. First is high winds. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale puts wind speeds, damage inflicted, and power outages into five categories. Category Wind Speed Surge in Feet Damage Home Damage Tree Damage Power Outages 1 74-95 mph 4-5 Some Some Branches Days 2 96-110 mph 6-8 Extensive Major Snapped Weeks 3 111-129 mph 9-12 Devastating Major Snapped Weeks 4 130-156 mph 13-18 Catastrophic Severe Toppled Months 5 157+ mph 19+ Catastrophic Destroyed Toppled Months Second is storm surge. That's the rise in water above normal high tide. The hurricane's high winds pushes the water up onto the shore. When the storm surge coincides with high tide, you get storm tide. That unusual occurrence created the devastation during Hurricane Sandy. Water weighs 1,700 pounds per cubic yard. The force of the storm and the weight of the water combined is very damaging. A 23-foot storm surge would flood 67 percent of U.S. interstates, including 57 percent of arterial highways. It would cover almost half of rail miles, 29 airports and almost all ports in the Gulf Coast area. Third is extreme rainfall. Hurricanes can drop up to six inches of rain per hour. Hurricane Harvey dumped 51.88 inches in Cedar Bayou on August 26, 2017. That’s a record for a single storm in the continental United States. These down-bursts create flash floods. Flooding accounts for 59 percent of deaths. It also ruins equipment, automobiles and homes. Fourth is location. Most U.S. hurricanes form in the Gulf and Caribbean. Hurricanes only form over oceans near the equator. As warm moist air rises, cool dry air rushes in to replace it. If this cycle intensifies enough, it creates a hurricane. Once these storms make landfall, they lose power without the warm moist ocean air to feed them. Fifth is the time of the year. Hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30. The most dangerous time is between mid-August and mid-October. That's because it's the least windy time of year. High winds destroy hurricanes before they have a chance to form. Sixth is preparedness. Cities that evacuate their population have fewer deaths and human destruction. But evacuations don't prevent property damage. Most hurricanes enter the home through the garage. The most-storm resistant are windowless garage doors less than nine feet wide that can withstand 50 or more pounds of pressure. Homeowners should fortify their roofs with hurricane clips. Many builders are using insulating concrete forms instead of timber construction. They also anchor the home to the foundation. A seventh and recent cause is global warming. Between 1956-2005, the Earth's average temperature rose .13°C each decade. This might not seem like much, but that's double the rate for the 100 years between 1906 and 2005. Antarctic glaciers are losing mass at an "unusually rapid" rate. That increases sea levels which worsen storm surges. Climate change may also cause hurricanes to remain in place longer. A 2018 study found hurricanes have slowed by 10 percent since 1949. The steering winds that push them are slowing down. These winds draw power from the temperature differences between the tropics and the poles. But climate change has raised pole temperatures. That lessens the temperature difference, weakening the winds that now move hurricanes more slowly. Which Hurricanes Caused the Most Damage Hurricane Katrina was the most damaging hurricane by far. University of North Texas Professor Bernard Weinstein put the total economic impact at $250 billion. It damaged 19 percent of U.S. oil production, causing gas prices to rise to almost $5 a gallon. As a result, economic growth slowed to 1.3 percent in the quarter after Katrina. That's down from the 3.8 percent growth before the storm. The National Hurricane Center estimated direct damage at $125 billion. Half of these losses were a result of flooding in New Orleans. Katrina hit Louisiana on August 29, 2005. It left 1,836 people dead. It was a Category 3 when it made landfall. Katrina had been a Category 5 when it was still out to sea. The second most damaging was Hurricane Harvey. This Category 4 storm cost $180 billion. It hit Texas on August 25, 2017. Hurricane Irma was the third worst. The Category 5 storm cost $100 billion. It hit Puerto Rico on September 7, 2017, and Florida on September 10, 2017. Hurricane Sandy caused $71.4 billion in damage. It hit New Jersey on October 29, 2012. It combined a 990-foot wide hurricane, a cold front and storm tides worsened by a full moon. It damaged 650,000 homes. Eight million customers lost power. Sandy was responsible for 159 deaths. Hurricane Ike cost $29.5 billion. It hit Galveston Island, Texas, on September 13, 2008. It destroyed 10 Gulf offshore oil rigs. All 22 Texas land-based oil refineries were shut down. Gas prices spiked to $5.00/gallon. Ike was a Category 4 at its peak. It calmed down to a Category 2 when it hit Texas. The area had just been devastated by Hurricane Gustav. It hit Louisiana two weeks earlier. Gustav cost $4.6 billion. It had been a Category 4 at its peak, but calmed down to a Category 2 by landfall. Hurricane Andrew comes next. It was a Category 5 storm that hit Florida in 1992. It destroyed $26.5 billion in property. It hurled a 16.9-foot storm tide into Biscayne Bay, a record for the southeast Florida peninsula. A storm tide is the sum of the storm surge and high tide. Next was Hurricane Wilma. This Category 3 storm did $20.6 billion in damage. It pummeled Florida in 2005 with winds as high as 120 miles per hour. Hurricane Irene came next. It was a Category 2 storm when it hit North Carolina on August 26, 2011. It had lost a lot of power as it traveled over land toward New York and Boston. Many people only experienced a bad storm. But it killed at least 20 people and left 4.5 million people without power. Storm surges in Manhattan were 9 feet high. Property damage was $15.6 billion. Economic impact was $45 billion. (Source: "Economist: Financial Hit From Hurricane Irene Could Top $45 Billion," Fox News Insider, August 29, 2001. "Hurricane Irene's Economic Impact," NPR Nightly Business Report, August 24, 2011.) The deadliest U.S. hurricane was in 1900. It affected between 8,000 to 12,000 people in Galveston, Texas. That storm killed 129 people and caused $1.7 billion in damage ($13 billion in today’s dollars) in June 1972. In October 1954, Hurricane Hazel killed 95 Americans and 81 Canadians. It was a Category 4 hurricane. (Source: "The Thirty Costliest U.S. Tropical Cyclones," Not adjusted for inflation. NOAA Technical Memorandum, August 2013.) Top 20 Hurricanes Here are the 20 most destructive storms to hit the United States. Notice that 17 of them have occurred since 2000. That's further proof of the worsening impact of climate change.

Read More NOAA Forms Hurricane Sandy Review Team, Again By Andrew Freedman Published: December 11th, 2012 , Last Updated: December 11th, 2012 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the formation of an interagency review team to study the National Weather Service’s (NWS) performance leading up to and during Hurricane Sandy. According to a statement from David Titley, the NOAA deputy undersecretary for operations, the team will be led by a scientist with NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, and will include two social scientists and 10 experts from NWS, FEMA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, none of whom helped forecast the course of the deadly storm.

Credit: New York Port Authority. This is the second time in as many months that the agency has organized a Hurricane Sandy review team. The last one was abruptly terminated in mid-November, just one week after beginning its work. The NWS gave different accounts for why the initial review was scuttled, first saying that it had never been formally approved at the highest levels of the agency, and then citing compliance problems with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which sets rules regarding the participation on such panels of non-federal employees. The initial team was to be headed by a weather expert from outside the agency, Mike Smith of the private sector forecasting firm AccuWeather, but the new team features only federal government experts. However, the team will be consulting outside partners, such as the emergency management community, about the Weather Service's performance. Smith said the composition of the panel calls its work into question. “The idea that all government employees allows for an "impartial and unbiased" review is ridiculous. All will have the perspective of government employees. There is nothing wrong with that provided it is complemented by "outside the box" thinking that non-government employees can provide. This especially true since many of the members of the team depend on NOAA for a paycheck,” he wrote on his blog. Smith also criticized NOAA for selecting a fisheries agency employee to lead the review of a major weather event. “The major issues surrounding Sandy are meteorological. It is disappointing that the head of the assessment will not have a meteorological background and, perhaps, not know which rocks to turn over.” Hurricane Sandy presented the NWS with a set of unprecedented challenges, since it was a hurricane that also took on characteristics more closely associated with cold season storms as it roared up the heavily populated eastern seaboard. NWS opted not to issue hurricane warnings for any locations north of North Carolina, despite the fact that many coastal locations experienced hurricane force winds of greater than 74 mph while the storm was officially classified as a hurricane. The decision not to issue such warnings was made in order to avoid having to drop the warnings if the storm completed its transition to a hybrid, or post-tropical, cyclone, according to Rick Knabb, the director of the National Hurricane Center.

Many prominent meteorologists, including on-air experts at The Weather Channel, have criticized this decision, noting that hurricane warnings might have saved lives by spurring people to action, instead of the “high wind warnings” and other advisories that local NWS offices issued, which can be more difficult to interpret. Specifically, the lack of a hurricane warning seemed to influence New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s decision to downplay the storm during a news conference and not to order the evacuation of low-lying portions of the city until just 24-hours remained before the storms arrival. “It was the worst communication debacle that I can remember from the National Weather Service,” wrote Weather Channel meteorologist Bryan Norcross on his blog, referring to the lack of hurricane warnings. The decision not to issue hurricane warnings for New York and New Jersey is among the issues the review committee will look into, said NWS spokesman Chris Vaccaro. The NWS is in the process of revising its storm warning policies to give it added flexibility should it ever face a massive, transitioning storm such as Sandy again, although this too has been shrouded in some mystery, after a senior forecaster at the Hurricane Center told AccuWeather that such a change had already been agreed to, but NOAA headquarters described it as a draft proposal. According to Titley, the team of 12 experts chosen to be on the review team did not forecast Sandy. “This allows for an impartial and unbiased review,” he said. “The team will focus on three main areas: the philosophies and policies behind the forecast and the weather watch and warning products and how they are communicated; how storm surge products are produced and issued from multiple NOAA Line Offices; and the web presence as a tool for communicating with the public.” The team will start its work this month, with an interim report due to NOAA leadership in the spring. The agency hopes to implement some of the necessary policy changes before the start of the 2013 hurricane season on June 1. “I look forward to the findings and any recommended ways the National Weather Service can do an even better job to protect life and property through timely and accurate forecasts,” Titley said. Hurricane Sandy caused at least $100 billion in damage, and killed at least 125 people in the U.S., many of them from the storm's powerful storm surge that destroyed low-lying areas of New Jersey, New York, and other states.
Rihanna brings star power to New York Daily News' Hurricane Sandy relief effort Rihanna arrives at The 40/40 Club on Friday, Nov. 9, 2012 in New York, NY Rihanna donated 1,000 sleeping bags to the Daily News’ Hurricane Sandy relief effort, and transformed Friday’s release party at The 40/40 Club for her next album into a rally to collect more material for the needy.

Vicious Superstorm Sandy Smashes U.S. Northeast Cities NEW YORK, New York, October 29, 2012 (ENS) – After claiming 69 lives in the Caribbean countries it ravaged last week, Hurricane Sandy struck land near Atlantic City, New Jersey about 8 pm Monday night. Four hours later, 11 more people have lost their lives to the howling winds and flooding rains of the enormous storm. Stretching nearly 1,000 miles along the Atlantic coast, the winds from Hurricane Sandy blew down power lines and trees, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. Crews cannot get to the stricken lines in the dark along flooded streets and roadways. Hurricane Sandy walloped New York City with wind and rain, October 29, 2012 (Photo by elkquakes) The big cities of the Northeast, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, all endured torrential rainfall and winds gusting to more than 85 mph. As Sandy turned northwestward over land, it met a cold-weather system from the north that turned it into an unprecedented superstorm, dumping up to three feet of snow in West Virginia and the central Appalachians. Now classified as a post-tropical cyclone, Sandy is still packing hurricane-force winds, although it is weakening slightly as it moves north across New England. Packing 80 mph winds, the storm hit Battery Park at the tip of Manhattan with a record 13-foot surge of seawater due in part to the full moon high tide. Subway tunnels and stations are flooded, the Metro Transit Authority says, and Con Edison will be struggling for days to repair damages to the power system that have darkened much of Lower Manhattan, including Wall Street. On the east side of Manhattan Monday night, 19 workers were trapped inside a Consolidated Edison power station by rising floodwaters, according to a Reuters news witness. A rescue worker, who asked not to be named, said the station had suffered an explosion inside. Con Edison deliberately shut off power to Manhattan below 39th Street and parts of Brooklyn, a move “that will protect both company and customer equipment, and allow for quicker restoration after Hurricane Sandy passes,” the company said in a statement Monday night. “Sea water from Hurricane Sandy’s storm surge threatened to flood the underground electrical delivery system, prompting the shutdown.” The company says some 250,000 customers in Manhattan and Westchester County are without power. Thousands of company employees and field crews are working around the clock to restore power joined by 500 outside utility contractors who are here to assist with storm restoration. Winds gusting over 90 mph blew an unsecured crane off its tower at a 57th Street building (Photo by inferno10) On 57th Street at Sixth Avenue, an unsecured crane atop a tall building was blown off its moorings at the One57 Building, a luxury 90-story apartment tower under construction. It remains there, dangling 74 floors above the street. The city of New York is at a standstill with all public transportation systems shut down until further notice and authorities asking that people not drive to leave the roads clear for emergency vehicles. All three major airports in the New York-New Jersey area are closed due to the storm as are airports in Atlantic City and New Haven, Connecticut – nearly 12,000 flights have been canceled. Philadelphia’s public transportation system was shut down just after midnight Monday and will not be moving passengers on Tuesday, officials said. “We’re working around the clock, and we’ve arranged for more than 1,600 additional outside personnel who will help with damage assessment and outage restoration. Nearly all of those additional workers are already here, with more on the way,” said David Bonenberger, vice president of Distribution Operations ⁬with PPL Electric Utilities. “They are coming from states as far away as North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Missouri and we’re glad to have them.” All utilities are issuing similar warnings. In the worlds of Con Edison, “If you see downed electrical wires, do not go near them. Treat all downed wires as if they are live. Never attempt to move or touch them with any object. Be mindful that downed wires can be hidden from view by tree limbs, leaves or water. Report all downed wires to Con Edison and your local police department immediately.” In Massachusetts damaging winds are forecast to persist on Tuesday with associated widespread power outages. The south-facing coastline is experiencing major coastal flooding overnight. Boston’s transport system has been shut down but some lines will be open on Tuesday as MBTA crews work to clear downed trees, power lines, and storm-related debris. President Barack Obama and Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, canceled all campaign appearances, with just a week to do before Election Day. Sandy’s high winds stretched for nearly 1,000 miles along the Atlantic coast of the United States, The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite on the Suomi NPP satellite acquired this natural-color image of Hurricane Sandy at 1:50 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, October 28, 2012. (NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen) The President has authorized emergency declarations for Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The declarations authorize FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts for required emergency measures to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety. The President is directing FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate to ensure that federal partners continue to bring all available resources to bear to support state, tribal, and local responders. Currently, more than 1,500 FEMA personnel are positioned along the East Coast working to support disaster preparedness and response operations, including search and rescue, situational awareness, communications and logistical support. In addition, 28 teams comprised of 294 FEMA Corps members are pre-staged to support Sandy responders. Three federal urban search and rescue task forces are positioned in the Mid-Atlantic and ready to deploy as needed. To the south across the Caribbean, people are cleaning up and mourning their dead. The worst of Sandy’s damage happened in Haiti, where 52 people are dead as a result of heavy flooding and strong winds that blew from Wednesday through Friday. Most of the deaths occurred in southern Haiti and in Port-au-Prince, where many residents still live in makeshift shelters after the 2010 earthquake. On the other side of the island in the Dominican Republic, two men drowned while trying to cross rivers in separate incidents, while rains and wind damaged nearly 3,500 homes and more than 18,000 people were evacuated by the government, the AP reported. On Thursday, Sandy struck Cuba as a Category 2 hurricane, killing 11 people in the provinces of Santiago and Guantanamo. In the Bahamas on Friday, two people were killed, including a British banker who fell from his roof as he tried to repair a window shutter. In Puerto Rico, one man was drowned in a flooded river, and more than 100 families were forced to evacuate.
Hurricane Sandy Hurricane Sandy track Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. Classified as the eighteenth named storm, tenth hurricane and second major hurricane of the year, Sandy was a Category 3 storm at its peak intensity when it made landfall in Cuba. While it was a Category 2 storm off the coast of the Northeastern United States, the storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record (as measured by diameter, with winds spanning 1,100 miles (1,800 km)). At least 285 people were killed along the path of the storm in seven countries. Sandy developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, quickly strengthened, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sandy six hours later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles and gradually intensified. On October 24, Sandy became a hurricane, made landfall near Kingston, Jamaica, a few hours later, re-emerged into the Caribbean Sea and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. The Government of Cuba posted a hurricane watch for the cuban provinces of Camaguey, Granma, Guantanamo, Holguin, Las Tunas and Santiago de Cuba at 1500 UTC on October 23rd. Only three hours later, the hurricane watch was switched to a hurricane warning. At least 55,000 people had been evacuated principally because of expected flooding before the hurricane impact. On October 25, Sandy hit Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane. Sandy made landfall just west of Santiago de Cuba, the country's second-largest city, as a strong Category 2 hurricane, with the strong eastern eyewall passing directly over the city. The eye of the storm came ashore just west of the city with waves up to 29 feet (9 meters) and a six-foot (2 meter) storm surge that caused extensive coastal flooding. Reports from the area after the passage of Sandy spoke of widespread damage, particularly to Santiago de Cuba. Throughout the province, 132,733 homes were damaged, of which 15,322 were destroyed and 43,426 lost their roof. Electricity and water services had been knocked out, and most of the trees in the city had either been ripped off their roots or had lost all their leaves. Several Cuban provinces promised to send brigades to help Santiago recover, although officials gave a long list of other towns that suffered devastation. Guantanamo City followed a similar fate to Santiago, with television showing telephone poles and cables down across the city. Several historic buildings in the centre of town were reportedly damaged. Total losses throughout Santiago de Cuba province reached 50mil GBP. State media has said at least 11 people in Cuba were killed as a result of the storm, and president Raul Castro planned to visit Santiago de Cuba in the coming days. Most of the victims were trapped in destroyed houses. This makes Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit Cuba since 2005, when Hurricane Dennis killed 16 people. The province of Santiago de Cuba was practically devastated after the passing of Hurricane Sandy. Preliminarily it was stated that the nine municipalities of the territory suffered the terrible consequences of Sandy although the biggest losses were reported in Santiago de Cuba city, Palma Soriano, San Luis and Guama. In Santiago de Cuba city thousands of trees were knocked down, the blocked roads, and caused severe disruptions in electrical networks. Strong, hurricane winds caused damages to 109 grocery shops, 90 bakeries and 43 food markets. Many chicken and pig farms were effected too, while 26.6 tons of food were destroyed. In a preliminary evalutation, in 8 of the nine municipalities of the region (excluding Santiago de Cuba city) there are 4249 houses coming under total destruction and 34.000 partially damaged. In agriculture, more than 2600 hectares of bananas were swept out as well as coffee plantations in mountainous areas. Etecsa (national phone company) reported that there are 8 base stations out of service and the television system is down in the southeastern parts because of damage to the radio relay of the Gran Piedra. Currently, Guama does not have basic telephony services, mobile network and TV. Some of the Santiago de Cuba municipalities reported cut off areas caused by overflow of rivers, especially in the regions of Guama and Segundo y Tercer Frente. The authorities urged people to excercise extreme measures for the protection of human life. The motorway that leads to Chivirico (head of the municipality of Guama) is destroyed Damages in Guantanamo In the easternmost province of the country, preliminary reports shows damages in the housing and government institutions, mainly the loss of the roofs, and the partial collapse of several buildings. The damages are substantial in agriculture, in greenhouses, seedlings, roads and other. Electrical and telephone networks were affected by the strong winds of 140 KmPH and measures are taken to restore them. In Im�as, the optical fibre suffered fractures that affected communications. The same happened in Bayate, Limonar, La Escondida and Costa Rica. The losses have been reported in the coffee harvest in Maisi town and viands plantations in Chutines, a place located on the highway to Caimanera. Damages in Holguin The preliminary reports show hundreds of homes with loss of roofs, partial and total collapse of some buildings and significant interruptions of electricity supply. Damages in other regions Sandy Hurricane caused less severe damages in Granma province. More than 170.000 people were evacuated in this regions with 4.000 of them placed in the shelters. The greatest damage caused by the hurricane were reported in the electricity service, especially in the municipalities of Guisa, Cauto Cristo Jiguan�, Pilon, Bartolome Maso, Media Luna and Bayamo. At the moment it was estimated that more than half of the population lacked electricity. In Las Tunas province a partial damages to houses, groceries and schools were reported. Some villages road are cut off due to the flooding caused by Sandy. Eleven people died as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba, state media reported. Nine deaths occurred in Santiago de Cuba province and two bodies were recovered in Guantanamo state, national media reported, citing civil defense authorities. 2012-10-23 09.00 GMT –CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY...THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA HAS CHANGED THE HURRICANE WATCH TO A HURRICANE WARNING FOR THE CUBAN PROVINCES OF CAMAGUEY...LAS TUNAS...GRANMA...SANTIAGO DE CUBA...HOLGUIN...AND GUANTANAMO. 2012-10-23 06.00 GMT – GOVERNMENT OF CUBA ISSUES A HURRICANE WATCH FOR PROVINCES OF CAMAGUEY, LAS TUNAS, SANTIAGO DE CUBA, HOLGUIN AND GUANTANAMO. 2012-10-22 07.00 GMT – OFFICIALS IN EASTERN CUBA AND THE BAHAMAS MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF SANDY.
Frankenstorm: Why Hurricane Sandy Could Be the Perfect Storm, Part II You can call it the Frankenstorm, or the Snowicane, or the Snow'easter or just plain old Sandy. But whatever you name it, the mega-storm that now seems likely to blast much of the East Coast next week could be a natural disaster for the record books. You can call it the Frankenstorm, or the Snowicane, or the Snow’easter, or just plain old Sandy. But whatever you name it, the megastorm that now seems likely to blast much of the East Coast next week could be a natural disaster for the record books. The rare mix is the result of Hurricane Sandy, a Category 2 storm now hitting the Caribbean, an unusually early winter storm coming from the West and a fierce Arctic air coming from the North. Those air masses are now predicted to combine with each other — right over the country’s most populated and developed stretch of real estate, including New York City. That would make it, well, this: Seriously, though, this storm is no joke. The perfect storm of 1991 — the one that caused the events in the book and movie of the same name — had a similar makeup but did only about $200 million in damages, largely because its worst effects were felt in comparatively less populated parts of New England. But if, as early forecasts are suggesting, the new storm hits New York and New Jersey, the effects could be worse than last year’s Hurricane Irene. This could be a $1 billion storm at minimum if the hurricane follows the right path. The storm is likely to hit first this Sunday, but its effects could easily stretch through Halloween, as government forecaster Jim Cisco told the AP’s Seth Borenstein: It’s almost a weeklong, five-day, six-day event. It’s going to be a widespread serious storm. We don’t have many modern precedents for what the models are suggesting. As if this isn’t bad enough, the storm will also hit during a full moon, when tides will be at their highest. That increases the chance of major coastal flooding, as does the fact that the slow-moving storm is expected to dump several inches of rain onto the New York area. New York City just missed a direct hit from Irene; a little more coastal flooding during that storm, and the damage to infrastructure like commuter railways and the subway could have been catastrophic. New York may not be so lucky this time, as this storm tracker from the Weather Channel shows. In this scenario, Sandy would be able to bring sustained winds near hurricane force over a wide stretch of heavily populated coast, causing massive power outages, as trees still in leaf fall and take out power lines. Sandy is expected to have tropical storm-force winds that extend out more than 300 miles from the center, which will drive a much larger storm surge than its winds would ordinarily suggest. The full moon is on Monday, which means astronomical tides will be at their peak for the month, increasing potential storm surge flooding. Fresh water flooding from heavy rains would also be a huge concern. It’s important to remember that even though Irene didn’t turn out to be the Day After Tomorrow catastrophe that some were forecasting, it still did plenty of damage with its prolonged rains and winds that submerged even inland towns. Even though New York City itself was largely spared, damages were still over $15 billion. The danger a storm or any other natural disaster poses isn’t primarily a matter of a strength; it’s a matter of where it hits. The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season has been a very active one, with 19 named tropical storms and 10 hurricanes, the latest being Sandy. Most of those storms never made landfall, though, instead spinning back out harmlessly to the ocean. But Sandy, like Irene a year ago, seems to be headed straight for some very expensive and well-populated real estate. That’s a formula for a very bumpy — and wet — week for a whole lot of people. And maybe something worse.
Hurricanes Are Lingering Longer. That Makes Them More Dangerous. Hurricane Harvey over the Gulf of Mexico in August 2017. The storm stalled over Texas and dropped nearly 50 inches of rain in some places.CreditNOAA/NASA GOES Project With wind speeds that can top 180 miles per hour, hurricanes are not usually thought of as slow. Yet tropical cyclones, which include hurricanes, have grown more sluggish since the mid-20th century, researchers say. That may mean bad news for people residing in their path. A study published Wednesday in the journal Nature focuses on what is known as translation speed, which measures how quickly a storm is moving over an area, say, from Miami to the Florida Panhandle. Between 1949 and 2016, tropical cyclone translation speeds declined 10 percent worldwide, the study says. The storms, in effect, are sticking around places for a longer period of time. Lingering hurricanes can be a problem, as Texans learned last year when Hurricane Harvey stalled over the state, causing devastating flooding and billions of dollars of damage. The storm dropped more than 30 inches of rain in two days and nearly 50 inches over four days in some places . A report released this month by Harris County, which includes Houston, found that Harvey’s rainfall exceeded every known flooding event in American history since 1899. “The really, really high rainfall totals were because the storm moved so slowly,” said Deanna Hence, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was not involved in the new research. “The large amount of rain that is going to come out of a tropical storm or hurricane anyway fell in the same place over a long period of time.” To analyze the changes in translation speeds, James Kossin, a climate scientist with the National Centers for Environmental Information at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, tapped into a global data set on past tropical storms. The data include estimates of the latitude and longitude of each named storm’s center at six-hour intervals. By comparing a given storm’s positions over time, Dr. Kossin was able to measure how quickly it had moved across the landscape. He then calculated the average speeds of the storms from year to year, and found that tropical cyclones had been slowing over time. There are limitations to the analysis, said Dr. Hence. The study does not say how much of the extra rainfall produced by a storm like Harvey was caused by the storm staying in one place, as compared to other contributing factors, like the unusually warm ocean waters that fueled the hurricane. There is also the question of what is causing the slowdown. The new paper is a study based on analysis of observations, so it does not answer that question directly. But broader evidence suggests that climate change is playing a role. Belts of wind known as steering winds are responsible for moving hurricanes along their paths. “Hurricanes are carried passively by the winds that they’re sitting in,” Dr. Kossin said. “It’s not quite like a cork in a stream, but not too different, either.” The steering winds draw power from the temperature differences between the tropics and the poles. But because of climate change, that temperature difference is declining, weakening the winds. The slower steering winds move hurricanes more slowly. Adding to the evidence, researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research compared computer simulations of 22 past storms with simulations of those same storms based on future climate conditions. They found that average hurricane translation speeds slowed in the future simulations. The Journal of Climate published their conclusions this year. A growing body of research is showing that hurricanes are becoming more dangerous. A recent analysis by noted climate scientists, though not a peer-reviewed study, suggested that even as the winds that move hurricanes along are getting weaker, the winds inside hurricanes are getting stronger. The threats aren’t limited to those who live along coastlines. “Freshwater flooding is particularly dangerous because that happens inland and people don’t typically evacuate,” Dr. Kossin said. “If you live in a place with any sort of mountainous area — or any topography at all, really — then you have that compound danger of mudslides. As it’s turning out, it’s the freshwater flooding that poses the highest mortality risk nowadays in certain regions.” Kendra Pierre-Louis is a reporter on the climate team.

Read More East Coast Facing Major Threat From Hurricane Sandy By Andrew Freedman Published: October 25th, 2012 After undergoing a period of rapid intensification on Wednesday, Hurricane Sandy is now approaching the Bahamas as a Category 2 storm, with tropical storm force winds and battering surf spreading to the east coast of Florida. While there remains a lot of uncertainty about its path, computer-model projections continue to show that the storm will likely make a feared turn into the densely populated Northeast coastline early next week as a hurricane, or hurricane-like storm system. That encompasses nearly 50 million people from the Washington, D.C.-Boston corridor, and a roughly 600-mile stretch from Norfolk to Boston.

Since Wednesday, the threat of Sandy making landfall along the Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia coast has heightened, as more computer-model simulations have been projecting that scenario. If that happens, it could bring major impacts to vulnerable low lying areas, including Norfolk, Va., Rehobeth, Del., and even Washington, D.C. Those impacts could include major coastal flooding associated with onshore winds driving a storm surge on top of astronomical high tides, prolonged periods of damaging winds, heavy rains that would lead to inland flooding, and even heavy snowfall in higher elevations. Widespread power outages would also be likely, and the storm would bring an abrupt end to the fall leaf-peeping season, not to mention ruin Halloween for thousands. Additionally, if damage is severe enough, it could even affect Election Day. Other models take Sandy further north, making landfall near New York City, which would put Long Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts in the area of strongest winds and most significant flooding. However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the storm’s path, strength, and even its structure and as it moves northward near the East Coast. The bottom line is that people in areas from the Carolinas northward to Maine, but most especially from Norfolk, Va., to Boston need to begin making preparations as directed by local weather and emergency management officials. In a briefing for emergency managers, the National Weather Service forecast office in Philadelphia warned of the potential for "record coastal flooding," "record river flooding," and winds of 70 mph or higher in the event that the storm storm makes landfall near southern New Jersey and Delaware. The coastal flooding threat is perhaps the biggest concern, since the storm will have a large wind field and will affect the East Coast during a full moon, when tides are at their highest for the month. In addition, the storm will be a slow-mover, meaning that battering waves and storm surge may coincide with multiple high-tide cycles. Notably, this storm is coming almost exactly a year after the “Snowtober” storm that struck the Northeast in 2011, and 21 years after the “Perfect Storm” sunk ships and flooded coastal communities.

Credit: Weatherbell Analytics. The forecast track for Sandy that the models are showing would be extremely rare, if not unprecedented. As The Weather Channel reported on Thursday, only six hurricanes with surface pressures as low as Sandy is projected to have (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm) have moved within 200 nautical miles of the East Coast north of Virginia Beach and then made landfall. The most recent of those storms were Irene in 2011, Hurricane Bob in 1991, and Hurricane Gloria in 1985. None of those storms struck during late October, however, and the Perfect Storm was not quite as strong, judging by its lowest surface pressure, as Sandy is projected to be when it nears the Northeast. Forecasting the intensity of Sandy as it moves northward is a particular challenge, because the storm will be interacting with powerful jet stream winds aloft that are associated with an outbreak of Arctic air that has brought snow to many Western states, resulting in Denver’s first snowfall of the season on Wednesday. Typically, such a jet stream setup would help sweep a tropical storm or hurricane out to sea before it could threaten the U.S. However, in this case, the weather pattern across the Atlantic is boxing Sandy in as if it were facing a giant sea of bumper cars. A massive dome of high pressure near the Canadian Maritimes and Greenland, along with a storm in the Central Atlantic, are likely to combine to deflect Sandy back toward the U.S., according to most computer-model simulations run during the past 24 hours. Recent studies have shown that blocking patterns have appeared with greater frequency and intensity in recent years, which some scientists think may be related to the loss of Arctic sea ice as a result of global warming. The 2012 sea ice melt season, which just ended one month ago, was extreme, with sea ice extent, volume, and other measures all hitting record lows. The loss of sea ice opens large expanses of open water, which absorbs more of the incoming solar radiation and adds heat and moisture to the atmosphere, thereby helping to alter weather patterns. Exactly how weather patterns are changing as a result, however, is a subject of active research. The official "cone of uncertainty" track forecast from the National Hurricane Center.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NOAA/NHC. While it is not unusual to have a high pressure area near Greenland, its intensity is striking for this time of year. As Jason Samenow of the Capital Weather Gang wrote on Wednesday, the North Atlantic Oscillation, which helps measure this blocking flow, "is forecast to be three standard deviations from the average — meaning this is an exceptional situation." Hurricane Sandy may be an example of what can happen when a blocking pattern that may have been supercharged by sea ice loss occurs at just the wrong time — when a hurricane happens to be moving up the Eastern Seaboard. A Hurricane or Hurricane-like Hybrid? One of the many forecasting challenges is the likelihood that as Sandy moves northward, it will interact with strong jet stream winds that will add energy to the storm, but could also disrupt some of the thunderstorms near its core. The National Hurricane Center is predicting that Sandy will undergo a transition to a post-tropical cyclone, as it draws more of its energy from the dip in the jet stream rather than from the warm ocean waters. However, computer models tend to do a poor job of simulating such transition phases, which adds more wrinkles to the forecast. It is a safe bet, though, that Sandy’s wind field will spread significantly as it nears the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, which increases the threat of coastal flooding. Because of the combination of factors that will make Sandy a hybrid storm, the National Weather Service referred to the upcoming event as "Frankenstorm" in an online discussion on Thursday morning. Weather Channel hurricane expert Bryan Norcross said the interaction between Sandy and the jet stream is a major wild card in the forecast. “. . . the energy from the jet-stream can begin the transition of Sandy to a hybrid type of storm with a large center and strong winds spread out over a much larger area,” he wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “These large-diameter storms, whether they are tropical like Ike or Irene, or nor'easters like a big northeast blizzard, produce storm surge and other effects a long way from the center. In fact, the weather near the center is often not significant at all.”

Read More Hurricane Season Ends; Sandy Will Long be Remembered By Andrew Freedman Published: November 30th, 2012 The 2012 Atlantic Hurricane season officially came to a close on Friday, after four land-falling storms left coastal communities in tatters from Louisiana to New York. For the third straight season there were 19 named storms in the Atlantic, which is the third-highest level of storm activity observed since 1851. Ten of those storms went on to become hurricanes, only one of which, Hurricane Isaac, made landfall. But 2012 will long be remembered as the season of Hurricane Sandy. While it was officially classified as a post-tropical cyclone when it plowed into the New Jersey coastline on Oct. 28, it was by far the deadliest and most damaging storm of the season. Chart showing the path and strength of the 2012 Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NWS/NHC. Since 1851, only two hurricane seasons — 2005 and 1933 — have been busier than 2010, 2011, and 2012. The Atlantic has been in a period of active hurricane activity since 1995, which is thought to be related to a naturally varying climate cycle involving warmer Atlantic sea surface temperatures, among other factors. According to NOAA, such periods of high activity typically last between 25 to 40 years. Manmade global warming may also be having some small effects on tropical storms and hurricanes, but due to changes in hurricane observations since the 19th century, detecting such changes is extremely difficult. By using satellites and aircraft reconnaissance, scientists are now much more capable of spotting the short-lived, weaker storms that used to be missed by observation systems that were dependent on ship and coastal weather reports, for example. Computer modeling studies have shown that hurricanes in the North Atlantic Basin may become stronger as the oceans and atmosphere continue warming, but that there may be fewer such storms. Despite the unusually high number of storms in recent years, the U.S. has now gone a record seven years since the last major hurricane of Category 3 intensity or above on the Saffir-Simpson Scale made landfall. The last major hurricane to strike the U.S. was Hurricane Wilma, which struck Florida on Oct. 24, 2005. For the millions on the East Coast impacted by Sandy, though, its technical classification provided no relief. Because of its enormous size — its breadth of tropical storm force winds were the largest of any Atlantic hurricane on record, at about 900 miles across — Hurricane Sandy brought a storm surge that was more characteristic of a major hurricane when it plowed into the Northeast. Sandy’s price tag — currently approaching $100 billion and rising — is going to rival Hurricane Katrina’s, a 2005 storm that struck the Gulf Coast at Category 3 intensity. Hurricane Sandy killed at least 125 people in the U.S. Hurricane Isaac also brought a damaging storm surge to coastal Louisiana when it made landfall in late August. Both storms are spurring NOAA to rethink its issuance of hurricane watches and warnings, and consider adding a separate storm surge warning to the agency’s products. Currently, the Saffir-Simpson categories do not consider storm surge. “This year proved that it’s wrong to think that only major hurricanes can ruin lives and impact local economies,” said Laura Furgione, acting director of the National Weather Service, in a press release. “Mother Nature reminded us again this year of how important it is to be prepared and vigilant.” Image of Hurricane Sandy approaching the U.S. coastline on Oct. 29, 2012. This was taken from the NOAA/NASA Suomi NPP satellite.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NOAA. An average Atlantic Hurricane season has 12 named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. This season was busier than the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had predicted, largely because an El Niño event in the Pacific, which would have held storm activity down in the Atlantic, never fully materialized. Although it was an above-average season, there was only one major hurricane in the Atlantic, Hurricane Michael, and that storm remained over the open ocean. “Never in known history has the U.S. been so fortunate in avoiding the devastation brought on by category 3-5 hurricane landfalls,” wrote hurricane expert Brian McNoldy on the Capital Weather Gang blog. “One doesn’t need to be a fortune teller to predict that such a streak will end eventually, and hopefully this long vacation that we’ve enjoyed hasn’t made us complacent.” One other noteworthy aspect of the 2012 season is that there were several early-season storms. Two tropical storms, Alberto and Beryl, formed in May, before the June 1 kickoff of the official season. Beryl, which made landfall near Jacksonville, Fla., was the strongest pre-season storm to strike the U.S. in recorded history, according to McNoldy. And while Friday marked the "close" of the season, it does not mean hurricanes can't or won't form after this date. Since 1851, 20 named storms have formed or persisted into in the month of December, and four of them have occurred just in the past decade, most recently in 2005.
Tag: 2012 Atlantic Hurricane Season A cold front moved off the United States East coast on Tuesday. This front quickly weakened as it entered the extreme western Atlantic; lingering over the Southeastern United States. A wave of low pressure developed along the front in Georgia and has since pushed the front further off shore. With the front stalled to the west of Bermuda for so long, deep tropical moisture on a southerly flow has moved into the area around the western flanks of the Bermuda-Azores ridge of high pressure, with dew points reaching the mid-upper 60s. The low should continue moving eastward, towards Bermuda, but not deepen too significantly. Strong, gusty southerly and southwesterly winds ahead of the front are already moving into Bermuda’s western marine area. The actual front should cross the island in the early morning hours on Friday. Some thunderstorm activity is possible ahead of and along the front, these thunderstorms may contain gusty winds and heavy downpours. After the front passes, much less humid and slightly cooler air will start to filter in on moderate to strong northerly winds. See this page for any official advisories, watches, or warnings from the Bermuda Weather Service.High pressure will begin to move in and keep the weather relatively settled for the weekend. Interesting low pressure area in the Central Atlantic, worth keeping an eye on for Sub-tropical development. Elsewhere, in the Atlantic, there is a surface low developing as it interacts with an upper level low east-northeast of the Virgin Islands. This may need to be monitored for possible sub-tropical development down the road. However, it probably will not affect any land directly should it develop into a sub-tropical cyclone. The next name on the 2012 Atlantic Hurricane Season names list is Valerie. In the Southwest Pacific, Severe Tropical Cyclone Evan is completing a loop through Samoa as a category three equivalent cyclone with 115mph (1-minute) sustained winds. Serious damage has been reported in Samoa after the storm made landfall, reportedly produced a 10-15′ storm surge. Tidal gauge at The Battery showing the storm surge (green) lining up perfectly with the high tide (blue) to produce a massive storm tide (red) – National Data Buoy Center, NOAA. Also note that pressure bottomed out just above 960mb. A site at Sandy Hook, NJ stopped reporting before the peak storm surge/tide. Heavy rain combined with the storm tide on the Chesapeake and Delaware bays caused flooding in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The storm tide travelled up the Hudson river leading to record levels at Poughkeepsie. Rivers are still rising in response to the heavy rains from the storm still flowing into them. Heavy snow and (near) blizzard conditions are occurring the central Appalachian mountains and Ohio. Storm conditions are still occurring on the Great Lakes leading to very rough lake conditions and coastal flooding where onshore winds are producing 1-3ft water level rises. Damages from this hurricane will likely be astronomical in expense, mainly from the coastal flooding and power outages. In these coastal areas, many trees still had their leaves and so tree damage, power outages, and damage to homes from falling trees was the primary form of wind damage. Tree damage, power line damage, and roof damage from the weight of the snow, which was of a high water content, were the most common form of damage where feet of snow have fallen in the mountains. Meteorologically, this storm was significant because of its rare form of interaction with an extra-tropical system, its trajectory, its record breaking low landfall pressure of 946mb, and its size. A storm like this has immense potential to cause death and destruction and that it has indeed lived up to its potential. The name Sandy will likely be retired. A far reaching outer band of Hurricane Sandy produced scattered showers, some of which moved across the island and produced a tornado in Sandy’s parish. The tornado damaged homes and businesses, blowing in doors and windows, knocking over walls and ripping up a section of roofing. Squally showers are in the forecast until Sandy pulls further away from the island. Hurricane Sandy has top winds of 75mph, and although Sandy is expected to pass more than 300miles away from Bermuda, its extreme outer bands may produce tropical storm force winds, downpours, and tornadoes. The Bermuda Weather Service today investigated the damage and determined that it was indeed a tornado and that it was an F1 tornado on the Fujita Scale. An F1 tornado has winds between 73 and 112mph and produces minor damage. Tornadoes are not uncommon in tropical cyclones, especially to the right of the track. Tornadoes are not unheard of in Bermuda including ones that formed in Hurricanes. To understand why Bermuda sees so few tornadoes, think of Bermuda as a small target, and a tornado as an even smaller projectile – its gonna be hard for one to hit Bermuda. Tropical storm conditions are possible tonight and tropical storm warnings are in effect. Remember, tornadoes are always possible in tropical cyclones and so the threat for more will be there until Hurricane Sandy pulls away sometime around Monday evening. Sandy’s forecast track has changed little over the last day. The hurricane is expected to continue northeast or north-northeastwards today. A turn to the north should commence this evening or tonight, and a turn to the northwest tomorrow morning. Landfall is expected in New Jersey Monday night. Further deepening of this system has occurred with pressures falling to 951mb. Sandy could either hold its own, or continue to deepen up until landfall. Impacts:Heavy Rain – Widespread areas of 3-8″ of rain with localized areas of >12″ of rain are likely along and to the left of this storm’s track as Sandy moves inland. This could lead to moderate-major river flooding in the Mid-Atlantic states. Near-coastal river flooding may be exacerbated by elevated tides. High Wind – Tropical Storm conditions have been reported in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and gusts over tropical storm force have been reported in Virginia. Damaging winds to hurricane force are expected to occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland to near coastal cities. Tropical Storm force/gale force winds (>39mph) are expected to occur well inland with damaging gusts over 50mph common. This could cause severe tree damage or defoliation and lead to power outages or even structural damage as far inland as southern Ontario and Quebec. Storm Surge – A storm surge of 2-5ft is occurring along the North Carolina, Virginia, and Delmarva coasts, this could increase further as Hurricane Sandy continues an onshore flow in this area. Sound-side flooding is likely also occurring in Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. In Long Island sound and in New York Harbor, expect peak storm surges of 6-11ft. Anywhere else with onshore gale force winds can expect storm surges between 4 and 8ft. These are very serious heights above mean tide level and if combined with a high tide cycle, could produce disastrous coastal flooding and damage in a highly populated area. This storm surge will be accompanied by large battering waves that could produce erosion and additional structural damage. Records for storm surge values in this region could be threatened and the infrastructure in place put to the test. On the Great Lakes, the prospect of lake length winds on Lake Michigan have prompted lake shore flood watches to be posted in Illinois and Indiana. High surf and onshore gale force winds there could cause localized lake shore flooding there, a similar threat exists for Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Heavy Snow – In the middle Appalachians in West Virginia, a combination of tropical moisture, up sloping winds, and cold air filtering in on the west side of Sandy will mix to dump heavy wet snow and bring gusty winds. Near blizzard conditions are possible here and winter storm watches are in effect calling for 1-2 feet of snow in the highest elevations above 3000feet in altitude. 2-6″ are possible below 2000feet in altitude in West Virginia. In areas where deciduous trees still have leaves, the combination of snow and winds will produce significant tree damage that could lead to power outages, the weight of the snow may even lead to some roof damage. Bermuda Weather Service radar image of a squally shower of the west end of the island that possibly produced a tornado at around 9am local time. Bermuda: Bands of showers are expected to move through tonight and tomorrow. Squally showers in these bands could contain tropical storm force winds and tornadic activity is a distinct threat here. The Bermuda Weather Service expects 35-40mph southwesterly winds with gusts to 65mph late tonight – but this could be confined to the western marine area. Elevated surf along the south shore will produce dangerous rip currents and significant beach erosion, while making it hazardous to be out on the water. Why no tropical storm/hurricane warnings for the Northeast/New England? Hurricane Sandy could transition into a post-tropical storm as it approaches. If the storm is no longer tropical, tropical storm and hurricane warnings cannot be in effect for it. In the event this happens, all warnings would have to be switched to those used for mid-latitude extra-tropical storms which could lead to confusion among the public. So to avoid confusion, they are starting warnings off as those for extra-tropical storms. Hurricane Sandy over the Northwestern Bahamas with 80mph winds, the cloud pattern shows a highly sheared storm – and one that is transitioning to something more of a hybrid between tropical and extra-tropical. GOES-14 high resolution 1-minute rapid scan satellite imagery. around 12pm October 26th 2012. Hurricane Sandy has been blasting through the Bahamas with some of the Central and Northwestern islands seeing a direct hit from Sandy and hurricane conditions as a result. Overnight, high southerly and south-southwesterly wind shear commenced over the center of Sandy. This has disrupted the core structure of the hurricane and injected dry air near the center – starting its transition into a more extra-tropical structure. Meanwhile, the cleanup begins in the Caribbean islands already affected and, unfortunately, reports of death and destruction have come in from Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In total, more than 20 people have reportedly died as a result of the storm. Forecast Track… Sandy made the turn to the Northwest yesterday that had it skirt the northern Bahamas delivering hurricane conditions there. This morning, its forward speed has slowed and it has turned back to the North. Tonight, Sandy should turn more to the northeast and pick up speed in response to an approaching trough currently over the Mississippi valley. By Monday, Sandy is expected to be at the latitude of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the trough has since stalled over the interior Northeast and a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along it. This wave of low pressure will turn Sandy back to the northwest, towards the Mid-Atlantic/New England coast for a potential landfall Wednesday morning. Sandy will not be fully tropical by this time, so it will have a broad wind field and the exact location of landfall becomes less important as effects spread over three hundred miles from that point. Official National Hurricane Center Hurricane Sandy track as of 11am Eastern time October 26th 2012. Forecast Impacts… The Bahamas…Hurricane conditions will subside in the northernmost islands of the Bahamas this afternoon, and tropical storm conditions should subside by Saturday afternoon. Storm surges of 3-5feet are occurring in areas of onshore winds while rainfall totals of 1-4″ are expected. Winds have likely reached near 80mph on eastern parts of Grand Bahama island and most of Little Abaco. Hurricane warnings are in effect for these islands and tropical storm warnings are in effect for the rest of the Northwest Bahamas. Florida…Tropical storm warnings are in effect along much of the East coast of Florida. Tropical storm conditions are occurring along the immediate coast in parts of Florida along with squally showers associated with Sandy. These winds are kicking up very high surf and are generating storm surges of about 1-3ft. Rainfall totals here should be around 2″. Tropical storm conditions should subside from south to north along the East Coast of Florida today and tomorrow as Sandy moves northwards and north-northeastwards. Bermuda… Tropical Storm conditions are possible on Sunday here as the wind field of this cyclone expands. A tropical storm watch is in effect as a result. Squally showers with (near) tropical storm conditions and large southwesterly swells are to be expected to start the work week here. The fact that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda and along the US East coast simultaneously suggests a storm more than 600miles in diameter. US East Coast… *Saturday morning – Monday morning: South Carolina and North Carolina (to Wilmington) will see offshore winds as Sandy passes well to the east this weekend. Tropical Storm conditions are possible mainly in the offshore marine areas here, but unlikely on land. Some showers may develop to produce some gusty winds however. Tropical storm watches are in effect along the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. There may be an area of onshore winds in the Outer Banks for a time that could produce some coastal flooding, and sound-side flooding will remain a threat for much of the storm’s passage. *Monday morning – Wednesday night: Outer Banks, NC northwards to Maine: Sandy is expected to make landfall in Southern New Jersey, near the mouth of Delaware Bay according to the National Hurricane Center’s most recent forecast. The entire New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts coasts could see: tropical storm conditions with hurricane force gusts possible, heavy rain that may lead to some inland flooding, and severe coastal flooding from a large storm tide. Meanwhile, areas inland and to the south may still see tropical storm force winds (or at least gusts to that strength), heavy potentially flooding rains, and even some snow farther inland; this could extend as far inland as Ontario and Quebec. Off shore winds, to the south of Sandy, may allow for hazardously low water levels, or coastal flooding from an unusual direction in Chesapeake Bay and the Outer Banks. Specifics of this forecast will be refined as the storm gets closer. Pay attention to emergency management messages and products/warnings from local and regional officials. Hurricane Sandy at landfall in Cuba around 1:30am Eastern Time October 25th. GOES imagery. Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba around 1:30am this morning. According to the National Hurricane Center, Sandy had 110mph winds and a minimum central pressure near 957mb at landfall. The storm came ashore just to the west of the city of Santiago de Cuba where sustained winds of 78mph gusting to 114mph with a pressure of 960mb was reported before the station stopped reporting so conditions were likely worse than this at the height of the storm. A storm surge between 4 and 7 feet likely occurred near this city. Yesterday evening, Sandy exited the coast of Jamaica and underwent rapid intensification where the central pressure fell from 970mb to 954mb in six hours before its Cuba landfall. Sandy has since emerged from Cuba and has weakened slightly to a 100mph, 967mb storm. Some re-strengthening is already occurring as the storm heads northwards in an area that appears to be favorable for tropical cyclone development. The Bahamas are going to get the worst of Sandy today as this dangerous storm moves through the islands into the West Atlantic. As of 11am, Sandy had 105mph sustained winds and a minimum central pressure of 964mb. Forecast track… Sandy is expected to move northwards through the central Bahamas today and northwestwards into Northwestern Bahamas this evening, nearing the Florida coast in response to an approaching trough over the central US. From there, Sandy should be turned back towards the north-northeast as the trough starts to move off the East coast of the US, without a Florida landfall, and start to move into the Western Atlantic near the US East coast. On Sunday, Sandy is expected to turn back to the north and approach New England as it gets absorbed into/absorbs the trough over the Northeastern States. What to expect… Caribbean: Tropical storm conditions are starting to subside in Cuba and Haiti so warnings have been discontinued there, but heavy rain lingers in Haiti and the Dominican Republic where total rainfall accumulations are expected to be 12-18inches with isolated areas of 20inches in the mountains – life threatening flash flooding and mudslides may result, especially on Hispaniola. Bahamas: Hurricane conditions will be occurring in some of the islands of the central and northwestern Bahamas today and into tomorrow morning as Sandy moves through the island chain, Hurricane Warnings are in effect there. Storm surges up to 8 feet are possible in the Bahamas where onshore eyewall winds occur. Heavy rain of 3-6 inches is expected to cause some localized flooding in combination with storm surges. Florida: Late tonight and on Friday, tropical storm conditions may occur on the east coast of Florida where Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings are in effect from the Florida Keys to north of Melbourne. Up to three inches of rain are possible in Florida from the squally outer bands of Sandy. Some modest sea level rises and extremely rough surf will cause extensive beach erosion and very dangerous rip currents as the storm passes. Bermuda: Sandy may be large enough and head far enough eastwards to bring strong or even tropical storm force winds to Bermuda this weekend and into early next week along with some squally showers and very rough surf. New England: Early next week, after the Sandy moves away from the Bahamas, Florida, and Bermuda, it is expected to take aim on New England as it merges into a stalled trough that is expected to set up there. This is after day five in the forecast, so there is a very high degree of uncertainty in this track, but even more so because this situation is so delicate that any slight change in the trajectory after day five will send the storm into a different area of the coast. Regardless, expect a very severe Ocean Storm that may be comparable to the Perfect Storm in 1991, except expect Sandy to move inland and bring coastal flooding, tropical storm or hurricane force winds, heavy flooding rain, and as cold air from Canada associated with the trough moves in, some snow in the interior Northeast, especially in the Mountains. Hurricane Sandy on the southern coast of Jamaica. An eye is apparent on this RGB visible satellite image from NOAA’s GOES imager. Hurricane conditions could commence soon in Jamaica. Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Sandy this morning found that the storm has quickly strengthened into a category one hurricane with 80mph winds and 973mb central pressure. Some slight strengthening is possible just before a landfall occurs in Jamaica today where Hurricane Warnings are in effect. Heavy rains along with near tropical storm conditions are already occurring in coastal Jamaica; a gust to 51mph was recently observed in Kingston, Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center’s map of Tropical Storm and Hurricane advisories as of 11am Eastern. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for: * Haiti * The Central and Northwestern Bahamas A Hurricane Watch is in effect for: * The Central and Northwestern Bahamas A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for: * The Southeastern Bahamas * Florida East coast from the Volusia/Brevard county line to Ocean Reef, FL * Upper Florida Keys from Ocean Reef south to Craig Key, FL and Florida Bay Heavy rain of between 6 and 12 inches could trigger flash flooding and mudslides which will likely be the biggest threat to life in the Caribbean as Sandy exits to the north. Outer spiral bands extend far to the east of the storm and will likely produce heavy rains into Haiti and the Dominican Republic along with a chance for tornadoes and squally weather. Sandy is expected to continue northwards and make a second landfall in Eastern Cuba as a slightly weaker hurricane. But thereafter, Sandy is expected to begin to interact with a trough over the US East Coast and the forecast becomes increasingly uncertain. We are still unsure of how Sandy will interact with the trough, but it is looking increasingly like Sandy will become a powerful post-tropical storm that moves ashore somewhere from the Mid-Atlantic to Atlantic Canada that will cause severe impacts along the coast. This solution may involve the mixture of a tropical air mass and a polar air mass that could result in a heavy snow event for the interior Northeast. Depending on how far east Sandy goes, and how big the storm gets, Bermuda may see some strong winds- this solution is looking less likely today. Remember, the forecast after three days is still very uncertain but impacts to the US are becoming more likely according to the pattern that is unfolding. To make these forecasts more accurate, more weather balloons are being launched in the US, and hurricane hunters will continue to investigate the storm.

Read More Historic Sandy Poised to Blast Mid-Atlantic, Northeast By Andrew Freedman Published: October 26th, 2012 , Last Updated: October 26th, 2012 Hurricane Sandy is evolving into a potentially unprecedented storm, nicknamed “Frankenstorm,” and is headed for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where it threatens to cause widespread damage that will rival some of the biggest storms on record in the region. The storm, which has already killed at least 29 people in the Caribbean and Bahamas, will be part hurricane, part fearsome nor’easter, and is expected to bring tropical storm force winds to a wide swath of the coastline, from North Carolina northward to Maine. Although the exact point of landfall is still in question, computer models are converging on a most likely target from Norfolk, Va., to Atlantic City, N.J. on Tuesday into Wednesday, although the impacts from the storm may be felt in those areas as soon as Sunday. Track guidance from computer model runs on Friday morning, showing the expected turn into the Mid-Atlantic region.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NCAR. That track would bring the threat of major coastal flooding and very strong winds to the Boston to Washington corridor, home to about 50 million people, along with billions in expensive coastal property and infrastructure. About 66 million people live in the larger "Cone of Uncertainty" from the National Hurricane Center, which illustrates the storm's projected path. Hurricane Irene, which is not an ideal comparison because it affected a smaller area and was weakening as it approached New York City, caused $15.8 billion in insured losses alone, making it the costliest Category 1 hurricane on record. The biggest threat right now appears directed at the Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey coastlines, especially in terms of coastal flooding from the combination of astronomical high tides and wind-driven storm surge. Those threats also exist for New York City, and all the way up to Boston. The Weather Service is warning that winds of tropical storm force (sustained winds greater than 39 mph) to hurricane force (sustained winds greater than 74 mph) will lash the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states starting Sunday and lasting through Wednesday, bringing “potentially serious coastal erosion and coastal flooding.” The strong winds could spread as far inland as Ohio, depending on the exact storm track. “THE TIMING OF THE FULL MOON AND THE BUILD-UP OF TIDES OVER MULTIPLE TIDAL CYCLES SHOULD EXACERBATE THE SITUATION ALONG THE COAST, PARTICULARLY IN CORNERS SUCH AS THE NEW YORK BIGHT,” the Weather Service said. In fact, this storm has the potential to exceed the flooding seen in New York City from Hurricane Irene in 2011, when a storm surge came within mere inches of flooding the subway system in parts of Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. That flooding could have rendered some subway lines unusable for months. The large-scale weather pattern responsible for pinning Sandy along the East Coast.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: Remik Ziemlinski, Climate Central Heavy rains on the order of at least 5 to 10 inches are expected, particularly along the north of the storm’s track. Inland snow is also possible, with current projections calling for accumulating snow in western Pennsylvania and Southeastern Ohio. The storm is the result of a bizarre confluence of events, including a strong push of Arctic air moving southeastward from Canada and into the Midwest and Southeast, a powerful area of high pressure near Greenland, and storm systems out in the Atlantic. All of these factors are combining to pin the storm close to the East Coast, like a hapless football quarterback surrounded by onrushing defensive linemen. Atlantic Weather Pattern Is Stuck The upper air weather pattern that is steering Sandy, and helping it transition into a hybrid Frankenstorm, is relatively unusual, but not unheard of. The problem is that the pattern is occurring at precisely the wrong time — when a hurricane is moving out of the Caribbean. Weather Channel hurricane expert Bryan Norcross wrote about this on Friday. “The freak part is that a hurricane happens to be in the right place in the world to get sucked into this doubled-back channel of air and pulled inland from the coast,” he said. “And the double-freak part is that the upper-level wind, instead of weakening the storm and simply absorbing the moisture — which would be annoying enough — is merging with the tropical system to create a monstrous hybrid vortex. A combination of a hurricane and a nor’easter.” Recent studies have shown that blocking patterns such as the one that is currently over the Atlantic have appeared with greater frequency and intensity in recent years. Some scientists think that may be related to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which is one of the most visible consequences of manmade global warming. The 2012 sea ice melt season, which ended just one month ago, was extreme, with sea ice extent, volume, and other measures all hitting record lows. The loss of sea ice opens large expanses of open water, which then absorbs more of the incoming solar radiation and adds heat and moisture to the atmosphere, thereby helping to alter weather patterns. Exactly how weather patterns are changing as a result, however, is a subject of active research. Global warming is also expected to alter hurricane frequency and strength, making North Atlantic hurricanes slightly more powerful, while reducing the overall number of storms during the coming decades. Detecting such changes in the observational record is difficult, considering the varying ways people have kept tabs on hurricanes prior to the era of hurricane hunter aircraft flights. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that warmer sea surface temperatures are tied to an increase in stronger Atlantic hurricanes.

While it is not unusual to have a high pressure area near Greenland, its intensity is striking for this time of year. As Jason Samenow of the Capital Weather Gang wrote on Wednesday, the North Atlantic Oscillation, which helps measure this blocking flow, "is forecast to be three standard deviations from the average — meaning this is an exceptional situation." As Sandy transitions to a hybrid storm — a transition that appears to have already begun, based on the current satellite imagery, its wind field will expand, making the exact track of the storm’s center less relevant for the public to focus on. The storm may hold onto tropical characteristics near its core, since it will be traveling over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Sea surface temperatures off the East Coast are currently much warmer than average, as they were during the summer, when records were set off the New Jersey and New England coastlines. In official and unofficial forums, meteorologists are discussing the rare nature of this storm, given that computer model simulations show that it could intensify to a strength that has never been observed before in Southern New England or the Mid-Atlantic. In fact, experts at the National Weather Service’s Hydrometeorological Prediction Center in College Park, Md., who are responsible for forecasting the storm if and when it is no longer classified as a tropical storm or hurricane, are adjusting the computer model projections because they think they may be overdoing the strength of the storm. “[Computer model simulations] SHOW PRESSURE SOLUTIONS WELL BEYOND WHAT HAS EVER BEEN OBSERVED NEAR THE NEW JERSEY/NEW YORK COAST (EVEN EXCEEDING THE 1938 LONG ISLAND EXPRESS HURRICANE) EARLY IN THE MEDIUM RANGE PERIOD . . . EVEN THE PERFECT/HALLOWEEN STORM OF 1991 "ONLY" BOTTOMED OUT AT 972 HPA, AND THIS FORECAST WAS ALLOWED TO EXCEED THAT SYSTEM WITHOUT GOING OVERBOARD,” the center’s meteorologists said in a discussion posted online on Friday morning. In other words, this storm may still be of unprecedented intensity as judged by its minimum central air pressure, but it may not be the absolute horror show that is being projected by some of the computer models, which tend to overdo storm strength when hurricanes are transitioning into hybrid storms. Bob Henson of the University Center for Atmospheric Research wrote that the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region’s lowest measured surface air pressure on record occurred during the 1938 hurricane on Long Island, which was 946 hPa. Computer models have consistently been projected pressures down to between 935 to 950 hPa during this event. The minimum central pressure in a storm, be it a hurricane or a nor'easter, signifies how intense it is, and since wind results from differences in air pressure, it has a major impact on the strength of the winds around the storm center.
How Flickr Predicted Hurricane Sandy's Landfall Modern mega-events like natural disasters or public rallies are unlike their historic predecessors for one big reason that excites sociologists: Now these famous moments are insanely well-documented by the people who witness them. Take Hurricane Sandy. In addition to all that debris and damage, the storm left behind an extensive trail of tweets, Flickr photos, and even evolving Wikipedia edits. That data is now feeding the growing field of computation social science, more finely informing what we know about how vast groups of people behave during extraordinary situations. As another great example of this, researchers at the University of Warwick, the University College London, and Boston University just published some striking data on Flickr use during Sandy. In the journal Scientific Reports, they describe examining photos uploaded to Flickr between October 20th and November 20th of 2012, sorting for the words "Hurricane," "Sandy," or "Hurricane Sandy" somewhere in the tags, title, or description text. They tabulated the number of images by hour and found some startling symmetry between Flickr users and the behavior of the storm itself. The number of images increased as Sandy moved closer to the U.S. coast off of New Jersey. And then this happened: Hurricane Sandy's landfall is measured against the atmospheric pressure in New Jersey, recorded at 62 stations around the state that day (as the severity of a hurricane increases, atmospheric pressure drops). The greatest quantity of Sandy photos were taken in the very same hour as the storm's landfall. The implication? "We suggest," the researchers write, "that Flickr can be considered as a system of large scale real-time sensors documenting collective human attention." It makes sense that more people would turn their attention to a storm like this the closer it gets (or the worse it appears). The authors again, lead by the Warwick Business School's Tobias Preis: This would suggest that in cases where no external sensors were available, it may be possible to measure the number of Flickr photos relating to a topic to gauge the current level of this category of problems. A second alternative interpretation would be that users were well informed as to the expected time of landfall due to extensive media coverage, and that their attention to the problem increased as the anticipated climax of the disaster approached, leading to an increase in the numbers of photos taken. This would equally open the possibility that increases in Flickr photo counts with particular labels may reveal notable increases in attention to an issue, such that issues which have received less extensive media coverage but which may merit further investigation may be identified. We can also imagine that in those moments shortly after landfall, many people within photographing range of the storm suddenly had other, more pressings things to do than photograph it (like conserve their cell phone batteries). Of course, meteorologists and policy-makers don't need Flickr to tell them the extent and path of a catastrophic storm. But weather data can't necessarily tell us how people are responding to a disaster, or even whether most of them see it coming. About the Author Emily Badger is a former staff writer at CityLab.

Superstorm Sandy Superstorm Sandy, also called Hurricane Sandy or Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy, massive storm that brought significant wind and flooding damage to Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, and the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states in late October 2012. Flash flooding generated by the storm’s relentless rainfall, high winds, and coastal storm surges killed 147 people and produced widespread property damage in the areas in its path. The storm swept through the Caribbean as a tropical cyclone (hurricane), and, upon reaching the waters off the coast of New Jersey, it merged with a fast southeastward-moving cold air mass, which drew it westward over land. At its greatest extent, the storm measured more than 900 miles (about 1,450 km) in diameter. The storm caused more than $70 billion in damage in the United States and was among the most costly natural disasters in U.S. history. Origin and development of the hurricane Hurricane Sandy began as a tropical wave (a trough of low pressure) in the warm ocean waters of the central part of the tropical North Atlantic on October 19. The system traveled westward into the Caribbean Sea during the next few days, and it was classified as a tropical depression on October 22 in the waters south of Jamaica by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami. Absorbing energy as it moved northward, the depression grew into a tropical storm, and the NHC named the system Sandy. Superstorm SandyThe evolution of Superstorm Sandy, from its origin as a tropical depression in the Caribbean Sea and its transformation into a hurricane. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. On October 24, with sustained 80-mile- (about 130-km-) per-hour winds, Sandy became a category 1 hurricane in the waters just south of Jamaica. After its maximum sustained winds increased to more than 90 miles (144 km) per hour during the late evening, NHC officials reclassified the storm as a category 2 hurricane. Shortly after midnight on October 25, Sandy’s winds rose to 110 miles (177 km) per hour, and by dawn the eye had passed over eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba. Between October 25 and October 28, Sandy continued northward but declined in intensity, and it was reclassified as a category 1 hurricane and later as a tropical storm; after passing over The Bahamas and paralleling the coastline of the southeastern United States, the storm had again grown into a category 1 hurricane. On October 29 the storm curved westward toward the Mid-Atlantic states, and by 8:00 pm it made landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey, with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles (about 129 km) per hour. Origin and development of the superstorm Sandy was drawn westward by an unusual bend in the jet stream caused by the negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). When the NAO is in its positive mode, tropical cyclones and their remnants are caught up in the predominantly eastward flow of the jet stream and quickly thrust out over the cold water of the North Atlantic, where they dissipate. In the NAO’s negative mode, however, the jet stream bends northward over eastern North America. This change results from the presence of a strong high-pressure cell, called a blocking high, that stagnates over Greenland, and any eastward movement of storms behind the blocking high slows substantially. As the cold air mass—whose leading edge contained a small low-pressure centre—approached the hurricane’s warmer counterclockwise wind field on October 29th, winds circulating around the low-pressure centres of the cold air mass and of Hurricane Sandy began to mix. This interaction pulled part of the cold air mass to the south of the hurricane and turned the jet steam separating the two systems westward, which subsequently drew Hurricane Sandy sharply toward the New Jersey coast. Later that day, after the cold air had wrapped around and mixed with the warm air of the hurricane, both systems merged. This development effectively transformed the hurricane into a sprawling extratropical cyclone, which was renamed Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy by the NHC but was referred to as Superstorm Sandy by meteorologists and newscasters. Damage By early 2013, the official number of deaths from Hurricane Sandy, and its later evolution into Superstorm Sandy, was 147, with 72 reported in the Caribbean region, 72 in the continental United States, 2 deaths at sea in the Atlantic, and 1 death in Canada. In the Caribbean, Hurricane Sandy was responsible for approximately 54 deaths in Haiti, 11 deaths in Cuba, 3 deaths in the Dominican Republic, 2 deaths in The Bahamas and 1 death each in Jamaica and Puerto Rico. The high winds and torrential rains that buffeted parts of southern Haiti also destroyed crops and blew away or washed away thousands of tents and temporary structures that were being used to house refugees from the Haiti earthquake of 2010. The hurricane left an estimated 200,000 people without shelter. However, the bulk of storm-related deaths, injuries, and property damage occurred in the United States. An estimated 8.5 million people lost electrical service as a result of the storm. Several cities and towns along the Atlantic coast of New Jersey and New York were devastated, and the storm surge was made worse by high tides amplified by the full moon that occurred on October 29. Air, rail, and road transportation ground to a halt, with more than 20,000 flights canceled. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, property damage was estimated at between $30 billion and $50 billion; however, this estimate had grown to $71.4 billion by 2014. In New York City a storm surge measuring nearly 14 feet (about 4.3 metres) combined with heavy rains to cause the Hudson River, New York Harbor, and the East River to flood the streets and tunnels of Lower Manhattan. Parts of subway lines were inundated along with the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Flooding and power outages nearby forced the closure of the New York Stock Exchange, the longest weather-related closure of the exchange since 1888. Along the coastline of New Jersey, damage was extensive. Part of Atlantic City’s world-famous Boardwalk was destroyed, and many of the city’s homes and businesses that were not protected by seawalls were also heavily damaged or destroyed by the storm surge. The boardwalks of Seaside Heights and Belmar were also destroyed, along with many coastal developments along New Jersey’s shoreline. During the storm, water from the Hudson River overtopped the seawall protecting Hoboken and flooded much of the city, isolating an estimated 20,000 residents in their homes.

Rainfall records were broken throughout the affected area, and roughly 3 feet (about 1 metre) of snow fell in mountainous parts of West Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and western Maryland. Wind and rain disrupted electricity service from parts of Quebec to North Carolina and as far west as Indiana and Illinois.
On The Five Year Anniversary Of Hurricane Sandy, Is NYC Ready For The Next One? When Hurricane Sandy hit five years ago, on October 29th 2012, New York got a wake-up call. The unprecedented storm surge and subsequent flooding leveled coastal communities like Breezy Point and Midland Beach, while public housing residents, many of them elderly and infirm, were trapped without heat or electricity. Forty three people died in the storm in New York City, including two toddlers who were swept away from their mother in Staten Island, and a 13-year-old girl who drowned in her Tottenville home with her father. In the years since, both the city and state have made sweeping efforts to protect NYC should it be hit by another storm of Sandy's strength—and research suggests that could happen with much greater frequency due, in part, to melting ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. Still, with this past hurricane season wreaking significant devastation across urban areas like Houston and in Puerto Rico, and with climate predictions showing more Hurricane Sandy-like storms on the way, are we really ready? The answer, it appears, is yes and no. "We are absolutely safer than we were when Sandy hit because of the upgrades we've made to emergency procedures and because of the infrastructure investments we've been making," Dan Zarrilli, Senior Director of Climate Policy and Programs for the de Blasio administration, told Gothamist. "And we'll have much more to do before we'll ever be satisfied." Climate experts and advocates agree. "The bottom line is, after Hurricane Sandy, New York really took the challenge of improving coastal resiliency seriously and a lot of great work has been done across the board," Jordan Levine, a spokesperson with the New York League of Conservation Voters, told Gothamist. "New York is much better prepared for the next storm, and I think New York is significantly better prepared than a lot of other coastal cities around the country." But Levine cautions that "no city is fully ready for the next big storm. There's still a lot more work that needs to be done." According to the Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency, the city cobbled together $20 billion (a mix of federal, local, and public-private partnerships) to climate resiliency projects, and has thus far added 4.2 million cubic yards of sand and 9.8 miles of dunes to vulnerable coastlines in Coney Island, on the Rockaways, and in Staten Island, in addition to adding bulkheads to low-lying waterfront zones. The city rebuilt the Rockaway Boardwalk, transforming it into a flood barrier between the beach and its neighboring residential areas. It has set up flood protections and coastal storm risk reductions in neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sea Gate, and invested in resiliency programs on the Lower East Side, Midland Beach, Two Bridges, and Hunts Point, to name a few. Other efforts to bolster city infrastructure include funding future upgrades for NYCHA buildings, incorporating more flood and other climate protections into the building and zoning codes, securing FEMA funds for city hospitals, (some of which lost backup generators during Sandy), restoring wetlands in Staten Island, repairing and upgrading flooded subway tunnels, and rehabbing the water tunnel between Brooklyn and Staten Island, which was damaged in the storm surge. "These projects are going to be what we're talking about for the next several years, and we're working to integrate into our entire capital program, and really the entire city, build it into our DNA that we're building more climate resilience," Zarrilli, says. "We're doing that with our building code, we're doing it with our zoning code, we're adopting more design guidelines for our entire capital budget span for the city." "I think people are looking for single, big fix solutions, which people often like to have when they're faced with big problems, and we haven't really decided on building some kind of massive gates the way that London and Rotterdam have," says Ben Orlove, a senior research scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society and a professor at the Columbia School of International Public Affairs. "That's probably good, because I think any kind of major defensive work would create bigger problems in some areas, even if it would defend, say, New York City itself." Orlove says the city and state have done a good job of building up the city's gray infrastructure—non-natural additions like bulkheads, boardwalks and sea walls—in the wake of Sandy, but it still might not be enough. "There are larger areas of infrastructure that are hard to know what to do with, like the airports. What if they flood, not for an hour or two but for a few days?" Orlove said. "And I think there are other pieces of infrastructure that remain unknown. Lower Manhattan, there's some discussion of building a wall around a part of it." The wall refers to a Danish company's proposal to build a protective flood wall from West 57th Street down to the Battery; the city plans to incorporate some of that proposal as part of its Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency project. Orlove added, "It's very hard to imagine a high wall curving around the Hudson and the Battery and up the East River, but there'll be more flooding unless something is done, or there's some kind of relocation." Marshes help protect coastlines from storms like Sandy. (Courtesy the Nature Conservancy) Bill Ulfelder, executive director of the Nature Conservancy, says one of the best ways to combat coming natural disasters is to make significant investments in natural defenses. "I think the thing that people need to remember is that we can make really smart multi-benefit investments in things like nature, wetlands, forest, dunes, oyster reefs, mussel beds," Ulfelder told Gothamist. "Ultimately, the natural defenses of the green infrastructure produces a lot of benefits. It gives us wildlife habitat, recreational places, it helps clean our water. It itself can help absorb carbon and mitigate the causes of climate change." The city has worked with the Nature Conservancy to come up with a hybrid gray/green infrastructure approach, combining efforts to pair bulkheads and sea walls with green projects like marsh island restoration and oyster reef breakwaters in Jamaica Bay, and natural drainage corridors, called Bluebelts, in Staten Island. "There's a lot of investment going into green infrastructure," Zarrilli told Gothamist. "In fact, the amount of damage from Sandy was some hundred million dollars less because of the wetlands and marshes that were in place before Sandy." Some have voiced concern over the real estate boom along the city's waterfront over the last decade, even with the added flood risk. The Sierra Club, which is participating in a Hurricane Sandy Anniversary rally on October 28th, has called for "a moratorium on new real estate developments in flood-prone coastal areas," in addition to ramping up the city's transition to renewable energy sources, Lisa DiCaprio, Sierra Club NYC Group's Conservation Chair, told Gothamist in a statement. In response to the concerns about waterfront development, Zarrilli says, "I don't think we want to discourage that right now." "The turnover of older building stock into newer building stock means safer buildings," he added, a stance echoed by architects who are incorporating climate resiliency into their design. There is also the issue of relocation, which some experts say should be one of the key components in the city and state's efforts to shore up its coastline, both to prevent waterfront residences from getting destroyed and to replenish natural protections that have been lost to overdevelopment. Orlove pointed to a 2009 buyout program in Fargo, North Dakota, that purchased homes located near the Red River and turned the empty plots into a city park. "Having people being willing to move out of flood-prone areas does work," Orlove said. "It can be done, and I think we should look at that." Ulfelder called buyouts "a really smart investment in adaptation...This idea that you can not only move people out of harms way and thus avoid having to pay to rebuild, over and over, their homes, businesses, so you avoid those future cost but you also, in places allow nature to come back." There have been efforts to relocate residents in flood zones in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, and in 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a home buyout program to purchase and demolish homes destroyed in the storm, then preserve the land plots to protect the coastline. The program has been fairly successful in parts of Staten Island. The city has also been acquiring and moving and/or upgrading homes as part of the aforementioned Build it Back program. "We've been acquiring homes, some of which are going be redeveloped into safer and more resilient homes, and some of which are just going to be returned to nature because of our Bluebelts, or because they're adjacent to parkland," Zarrilli said. "There's definitely been some targeted work by the city already to consider ways to eliminate and reduce the density in some of our coastal areas." It's harder to address population-dense waterfront areas like Red Hook, Coney Island and the South Bronx. The city secured a $3 billion grant to upgrade multifamily NYCHA housing in coastal areas to mitigate the effects of a storm like Sandy, but as Zarrilli pointed out, it's a complicated issue. "That's what's been driving our land use analysis in coastal areas, to see what we need to do about density in those areas," Zarrilli said. "It's complicated for sure. It's not just a binary, you know, either buy out or not. In different areas I think the solutions are different." "You have 400,000 people in New York who live in the floodplain. Many of them live in public housing, they're very vulnerable communities," Levine, the NYLCV spokesman said. "They built their families, they built their lives there, and they're an important part of the fabric of the city, both culturally and economically. It's really challenging to tell people to pick up and leave." A woman lights a cigarette in the pitch black hallway of a housing project in Coney Island just a few days after Sandy. (Matt Richter) Still, Levine noted, no matter what, there are some parts of the city that can't handle development. "On some places you're not going to be able to build. Buying back those properties is smart policy, even if it is a very difficult one for those families who are currently there," he said. And though the climate change-combatting efforts are, of course, expensive—the city says it's spent $5 billion on resiliency projects over the last five years—the money we spend now prevents shelling out for damages in the future. "To truly be prepared, it's capital intensive. I think it's just hard for a lot of folks to recognize the level of commitment needs to be made to be ready for the future," Ulfelder said. "By some estimates there's going to be an average of $5 billion a year in damage to New York City related to sea level rise and climate change. That is staggering, but it's hard to invest the money today to get ready for something that's out there and that of course is the collateral challenge that climate change represents." Climate change can be mitigated, but at this point it probably can't be stopped. "This is just going to be a reality of the coming decades and centuries as the combination of storm surges and sea level rise makes these storms both more common and more catastrophic," Levine said.

Marie Colborne, 66, loaded her ailing 89-year-old husband into their 2010 Lincoln SUV as the storm swept in Monday night. The vehicle was found the next day just a couple blocks from their Harbour Ct. home, filled with water. The gears were still in drive with the keys still in the ignition. The couple's bodies were found nearby two days later hidden under a power boat that had washed ashore. Marie Colborne's daughter had urged her mom to get out. "I was like, ' Mom, get out of there - this one is not a little storm," Jeanne Mikkelsen told the News. "She said, 'Nope, we're staying.'" "She was a very strong-willed woman," added Mikkelsen , 47, a human resources consultant in Florida. Marie Colborne refused to evacuate because her husband, Walter Colborne, didn't feel well enough to travel, Mikkelsen said. Walter Colborne ran a successful Staten Island BMW dealership before selling the business about 20 years ago. "He was very elderly and frail and he said, 'I'm not leaving,'" Mikkelsen said. Mikkelsen was flying to Paradise Island with her mother 27 years ago when her mom first met Walter Colborne by chance on the flight. The strangers immediately hit it off, and Mikkelsen barely spent time with her mother the rest of the trip. "They've been inseparable ever since - including in death," Mikkelsen said. The couple drowned to death, autopsies found. Mikkelsen believes if they'd stayed put once the storm hit they may have survived. "I can't understand why she left when they they did," she said. "She ran out of there real quick. She left the garage door open."

Presidential race grinds to a halt as Hurricane Sandy approaches A windblown Mitt Romney greeted U.S. Rep. Connie Mack of Florida as he stepped off his campaign plane on Saturday in Pensacola. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The presidential race has ground to a halt as a massive hurricane churns toward the East Coast with just over a week until Election Day. The storm has scuttled campaign rallies and complicated get-out-the-vote efforts, particularly in the key states of Virginia and New Hampshire, as polls show the candidates locked in a dead heat. Advertisement President Obama left the campaign trail to return to Washington as the storm worsened Monday morning – skipping a planned appearance with former President Bill Clinton in Orlando. He is also missing a planned stop in Youngstown, Ohio. After Obama arrived back in Washington for a Situation Room storm briefing, campaign aides told Politico that the Republican candidate and his running mate Paul Ryan would cancel their own events on Monday evening and through Tuesday, "out of sensitivity for the millions of Americans in the path of Hurricane Sandy." "Governor Romney believes this is a time for the nation and its leaders to come together to focus on those Americans who are in harm's way," said the campaign statement provided to Politico. The storm is not without its benefits for President Obama, who is given the chance to demonstrate some presidential leadership just before Election Day. On Sunday, the president met with FEMA officials for a briefing about the storm after speaking by phone with the governors of affected states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and Romney supporter, praised Obama over Twitter, in fact, for his "leadership" in calling him directly. "My main message to everybody involved is that we have to take this seriously," Obama told reporters after his meeting with FEMA. "The federal government is working effectively with the state and local governments. It's going to be very important that populations in all the impacted states take this seriously, listen to your state and local elected officials." "This is an example, yet again, of the President having to put his responsibilities as commander-in-chief and as leader of the country first," said deputy press secretary Josh Earnest. Obama delivered a statement following the Situation Room meeting, where he said there has been "extraordinarily close coordination between state, federal, and local governments" to prepare for the storm. When asked about the potential impact on his presidential campaign, Obama claimed that he is "not worried at this point about the impact on the election." "I'm worried about the impact on families, and I'm worried about the impact on our first responders," he added. "I'm worried about the impact on our economy and on transportation. The election will take care of itself next week." Advertisement FEMA head Craig Fugate told reporters later, however, that his agency was preparing for the possibility that disruptions from Sandy could linger into next week and Election Day. "Our chief counsel's been working on making sure that we have the proper guidance," he said, according to Politico. "We're going through the regulatory policy and making sure all that's in place and we can support it." Another consequence of the storm: after millions of dollars spent by both campaigns on last-minute television ads, it's possible that they'll go unseen by residents of storm-affected areas left in the dark by Sandy. The Obama campaign also faces the danger that his administration will take some heat if its response to the storm is slower than expected. There is also the threat that either candidate could be accused of trying to politicize a natural disaster. Romney spokesperson Andrea Saul would not discuss the political ramifications of Sandy with Politico. “Governor Romney’s concern is the safety and well-being of those in the path of this storm, not political considerations,” Saul said. Romney had been expected to rally supporters in Wisconsin on Monday night. He was also scheduled to appear on Tuesday in New Hampshire, a state that will potentially take a beating from Sandy. The GOP candidate had also been forced to scrap a day of campaign rallies in Virginia this weekend. At a rally in Ohio before leaving the campaign trail, Romney called on his supporters to donate to hurricane relief efforts. "On the eastern coast of our nation, a lot of people are enduring some very difficult times, and our hearts and our prayers go to them as we think about how tough it's going to be there," Romney told the Ohio voters, according to video obtained by Buzzfeed. "I'd like to ask you who are here today to think about making a contribution to the Red Cross or to another relief agency, to be of help if you possibly can in any way you can imagine to help those who are in harm's way," he added. President Bill Clinton, who was scheduled to co-headline the Orlando rally with Obama, hosted the rally alone. The former President then traveled to Youngtown, where Vice President Joe Biden filled in for Obama. Biden, who earlier canceled a planned event in New Hampshire, announced late Monday afternoon that he would also scratch events in Ohio and Pennsylvania on Tuesday "out of an abundance of caution" so local law enforcement could focus on the storm. First Lady Michelle Obama was speaking at grassroots events in Iowa on Monday. As she kicked off an event in Iowa City, the first lady said the president has "made this storm his priority:" "I do want to take a moment to just say that our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by Hurricane Sandy," she said. "And Barack has assured state and local authorities that he is going to cut through red tape and be there to assist with whatever resources and support that are going to be needed over these next few days." A U.S. official told Reuters that the storm could postpone the Friday publication of October's jobs report, which could provide Romney with more ammunition against the president -- or give Obama more evidence that the economy is on the path to recovery. Advertisement "We will assess the situation when the weather emergency is over and notify the press and public of any changes at that time," Bureau of Labor Statistics spokesman Gary Steinberg told Reuters.
Tag: 2012 Atlantic Hurricane Center East Coast view of Hurricane Sandy, GOES Imagery from NOAA. October 27th 2012. Sandy has become so large that typical floater imagery doesn’t capture the entire storm. As of 11am eastern from the National Hurricane Center: Maximum sustained winds are near 75mph Minimum central pressure is near 958mb Sandy is moving North-Northeast at about 9mph. Sandy is doing a balancing act north of the Bahamas where it is trying to deepen (lower its central pressure) and expand its wind field at the same time. Fluctuations in its maximum wind speeds have been the result, and Sandy will likely continue to be at borderline hurricane status until Sunday night when it will try to strengthen as it gets energized by its merger with the trough over the interior Eastern United States. Hurricane Sandy’s pressure fell from 969mb at 11pm last night to 958mb at 11am this morning indicating deepening. While its maximum radius of tropical storm force winds expanded from 275miles at 5pm yesterday, to 450miles at 5am this morning. All Hurricane Warnings have been discontinued for now, but tropical storm conditions are still occurring in the northernmost Bahamas, offshore of Florida and North and South Carolina where tropical storm warnings are in effect. Further advisories, watches, and warnings will be needed as Sandy approaches, potentially from North Carolina to Maine. East coast states have already declared states of emergency and some evacuation notices have been posted in advance of Sandy’s landfall which is forecast to be somewhere in New Jersey or the Delmarva peninsula. Official National Hurricane Center track for Hurricane Sandy as of 11am Eastern Time. Tropical Storm Warnings for parts of North and South Carolina and the Bahamas in blue, and Tropical Storm Watches in yellow for parts of South Carolina and Bermuda. Impacts…Heavy flooding rain over 6″ in areas is likely near the storm’s path. Areas where both storm surge and flooding rains are a threat may have the flooding exacerbated by the unusually high tides down stream. Heavy wet snow is a distinct possibility in the higher elevations of Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Significant coastal flooding is also likely in areas of onshore winds and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where storm surges are forecast to reach up to 8feet and storm tides may be extreme due to the large changes between low and high tide and the astronomical high tide with the full moon on Monday. Damaging winds (30-60mph) could extend far inland causing tree damage and potentially some power outages. Structurally damaging winds (50-75mph) could occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland. Keep in mind that tropical storm force winds (sustained at >39mph) have been observed more than 400miles from the center of this storm – so even though the storm may make landfall in New Jersey, areas as far north as Maine and as far inland as Ontario and Quebec (including Lakes Erie and Ontario) could see tropical storm conditions. Areas to the south will have offshore winds, and tropical storm force winds will extend less far from the center and will be gustier in nature. In these areas, hazardously low water levels may be observed, especially at low tide. Meanwhile, there could be a period of tropical storm conditions in Bermuda (Tropical Storm Watch) sometime between tonight and Monday night as Sandy continues to expand and passes to the distant west. Squally showers will be the theme here during that period.
Field Observations and Measurements of Coastal Change - Fire Island, New York As Hurricane Sandy moved up the eastern U.S. coast and the forecasts were predicting significant impacts to the south shore of Long Island, a field team went to Fire Island on the south shore of Long Island, NY, to survey the beach, dunes and shoreline. The pre-storm survey was conducted on October 28, 2012. Following the storm, surveys were conducted over several days (November 1 and 2, 2012) to measure beach and dune erosion. The impacts to the island were extensive. The majority of oceanfront homes in the communities within Fire Island National Seashore were damaged or destroyed. Enormous volumes of sand were carried from the beach and dunes to the central portion of the island, forming large overwash deposits, and the island was breached in 3 locations. With few exceptions, lower-relief dunes were overwashed and flattened. High dunes, which are more commonly found within undeveloped portions of the island, experienced severe erosion and overwash. The elevation of the beach was lowered and the dunes form vertical scarps where they survived. Oceanfront homes were destroyed in the community of Davis Park. [larger version] More damage of oceanfront houses along western Fire Island. [larger version] Dunes were severely eroded and the beach elevation lowered during the storm. [larger version] Some key findings of the field data collection effort indicate that: 50% of the dunes on Fire Island were overwashed during the storm, carrying large volumes of material to the interior portion of the island In locations where the dunes remained intact, they eroded an average of 22m in cross-beach position Dune elevation losses were as high as 5m and the berm of the beach was lowered by as much as 3m The USGS worked closely with personnel from the National Park Service (NPS) to gain access to the island, and to survey and measure the dramatic changes to the barrier system. The post-storm data was used to help the NPS assess the areas of the coast that were most vulnerable to a nor'easter that impacted the coast a week after Sandy.

Wednesday's release of a scientific study concluding that the United States is experiencing an unprecedented drought in the number of major hurricanes, Category 3 and above, prompted an interesting exchange among scientists on Twitter on Thursday morning (April 30). The study published Wednesday in Geophysical Research Letters found that there have been nine years of no major hurricanes with winds... The United States is experiencing an unprecedented drought in the number of major hurricanes, Category 3 and above, with none having crossed the nation's shoreline since Category 5 Hurricane Wilma hit south Florida in October 2005, according to a new study published Wednesday (April 29) in Geophysical Research Letters. That's nine years of no major hurricanes packing winds of 111 mph or... As to natural catastrophes, the report said FEMA should take a bigger responsibility in leading a coordinated response, setting clear minimum standards for agencies and collecting regular status reports. It's a shocker many home and business owners in south Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast know all to well - getting slapped with a huge increase for their flood insurance. But for one couple in New Jersey it's gone a step farther: Their flood insurance premium jumped from less than $600 to $33,000, a story on NJ.com reports. Richard... After Hurricane Sandy, which ripped through New York City two years ago this week, the city continues to grapple with how to live with water and build back stronger, The New York Times reports. But post-storm construction projects "will most likely take years and billions of dollars to complete, if indeed that is ever achieved," the New York Times... Nine years after levee failures flooded New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and two years after Hurricane Sandy devastated the East Coast, the nation has failed to determine the flooding risks faced by communities across the United States, the American Society of Civil Engineers said in a new report.

I think the people who forecast weather really deserve a huge thank you. So, Thank you! I live in Florida and we often joke about how Hurricanes are overrated, and to some extent the wind part is in my humble opinion; we had over 100mph winds near Orlando with Charley and it was bad we were out of power for almost a week but we are used to that and plan for it. I don't think people from the NE plan for living without stores being open, gas stations being open, etc., for a week. The storm surge, that scares me and if I lived at near sea-level I'd be gone. Mike and others were dead-on, or slightly conservative with the forecast and had they not been so accurate there would have been may more deaths. Many more!

Search Listings: The City and the Storm The calm before the storm was much too calm, which should have been a clue. Forecasters had been talking about a potential Halloween hurricaneâthe Frankenstorm was its Â­headline-ready nameâfor two weeks. They thought it might be bigger than the hurricane of 1938; its barometric pressure was already a few ticks lower. The twist about this one, endlessly dissected, was that it was actually going to be two storms: Sandy would head north and encounter another weather system coming down from the northeast, a bank shot that would send the storm directly at New Jersey and a surge straight into the harbor, which is a natural funnelâNew Yorkâs own perfect storm. The subway was shut down early on Sunday night, more than 24 hours before expected landfall, and Mayor Bloomberg, a reborn weather alarmist after the 2010 blizzard, canceled school and told people to read a good book. Monday felt like Sunday on Seconal. For entertainment, we had breathless newscasters standing in puddles in their wet-weather gear, heralding the Storm of the Century that no one believed would really happen. âWhat preparations are you making?â asked an out-of-towner. âWe have a lot of tea lights!â said the New Yorker, suggesting that anything more might be overkill. Outside, there was a gusting breeze, pulsing sheets of blowing spray. Inside was a flashlight, maybe some tuna and sardines, a disaster pantry left over, unused, from Irene. And then it started. It hit New York first out in the boroughs, a fourteen-foot surge pushing into the swampy lowlands of Staten Island, floating houses off their foundations, flooding peopleâs cars before they realized they were in danger. At Breezy Point, a fire had started at seven with the tide rising. In Red Hook, the water had crested the bank that afternoon, making no exceptions, swamping the housing projects and the Fairway and the artisansâ studios with six feet of water. Finally, Manhattan itself began to be submerged. Water poured over the esplanades that are one of Bloombergâs most impressive legacies, swamping bodegas on the East Side, lapping the High Line on the West Side. At ground zero, 30 feet of water poured into the famous bathtubâsubmerging our last disaster. But that was only the beginning. Because then, the lights went out. Well, some of the lights. The city was sharply divided, zones of dark and light, a whole new demarcation of haves and have-nots. The line ran diagonally across the city, from 39th Street on the East Side to roughly 26th on the West. North and South quickly became two separate cities, one rich in power, the other suddenly, stunningly impoverished. And within the lower half, there were further new divisions. Those with cars (and means) could leave, the rest were stuck; some had gas burners, the rest ate their food cold; those with water towers had at least a few days with running water, others had to make do with hydrants. The drama of unequal division uncannily defined the crisis, just as it had an election year that was finally coming to an end. While Manhattan seemed to occupy center stage for much of the time, Sandyâs real sufferers were in the boroughs and New JerseyâBreezy Point, Staten Island, City Island, the Rockaways, the kinds of blue-collar places where most of the first responders came from, too. This was one of the many ways in which the event couldnât help but bring memories of 9/11 to mind. The first major symbol of the storm was the collapse of the crane atop One57, the very well-hyped 90-story tower that was poised to be the most expensive residential building in the city, with a $90 million penthouse. Comeuppance perhaps, but the omens were mixed. The generators at NYUâs hospital flooded and failed, leaving doctors and nurses to carry patients down the stairs in near darkness; but the Goldman Sachs tower was a supernatural beacon of light in the midst of the storm. Who did they have to pay? was the obvious thought. When power was restored, Manhattan got it first, leaving many of the cityâs suburbs in the cold. And yet most of Kings County woke up after the storm to full power, and Internet and cell-phone service, where lower Manhattan would be dark for days, which was just another reminder of Brooklynâs ascendancy. For those without power, the days after Sandy were a strange interregnum, a kind of shadow life. It turned out that what we were waiting for right before the storm was â¦ waiting, which was its own special kind of suffering. It was the calm after the storm, and calm is not why New Yorkers live here. Without electricity, the whole point of New York seemed to fray, then disappear. New Yorkers live with the illusion that you can do anything in the world that you might possibly want to do, even if in fact you may pass out on your couch. For the abruptly powerless, this faith was shakenâif a cup of coffee was a struggle, what else could you aspire to? And the absence of phones and Internet further cut our ties. In New York, many of us live partly vicariously. Weâre image processors, symbol manipulators. Things that happen elsewhere are evaluated and reworked and sent back out. After the gusts, there was a sense of airlessness, which was the absence of information. Cell phones drained to 45 percent, then 37, then 8, a metric that augured the end of connection itself. âItâs almost like youâre dead,â said a downtowner. âThe people are trying to contact you, but youâre beyond all that now.â With nowhere to go, the pace slowed down. Downtown was populated by walkers in groups of two to three, ambling like hayseedsâor extras in The Walking Deadâlooking for an open deli, of which there were only a few, to be browsed in the dark with a flashlight. Suddenly, downtown was not the place to be. Because life was going on elsewhere. Uptown, they had lights and cell phones and coffee and web service and delis and restaurants. They could live like New Yorkers, like human beings. Rumors filtered down from this paradise, rubbing it in. But making the trek uptown could be disappointing. The borderland is not the most appealing of neighborhoods in the best of circumstances. But at the dividing line between darkness and light, residents of SoPo (newly coined, for South of Power) engaged in a hellish 10 a.m. scramble for coffee and bagels, or queued up in long lines for Korean-deli steam tables, as the morning patrons of Muldoonâs on Third Avenue had their smokes and watched. The most desperate search, of course, was for outlets to charge cell phones. A couple of days in, the always trendy Ace Hotel took pity on these poor refugees and ran power strips onto the sidewalkâattracting a kind of information breadline. In the West Village, people lined up with their phones on the waterfront, trying to catch a signal from New Jersey. A bit gallingly, downtownâs most foresighted and well-heeled swells had already relocated uptown. Graydon Carter and Anna Wintour, among others, were said to have taken up residence at the Mark; a lot of the younger crowd, led by Emma Watson, were at the Carlyle. Uptown was the new downtown. On Halloween Night, Bemelmans was packed. Lower Manhattan, rather than the ultimate destination, became a place to go through to get somewhere else, as the enormous traffic jams attested. Downtown was driveover country. At night, it seemed to be a natural landscape, a dark canyonland, gorgeous and lonely. As in all New York disasters, New Yorkers werenât strangers anymore. Out surveying the damage with flashlights, people stopped to talk in tones of hushed amazement. Neighbors needed food and news. Just as with 9/11, the community of New York, always present, was brought into the open. In some ways, Sandy confirmed our communitarian values, underlining the importance of a government that makes a point of helping outâand that global warming was a problem to be dealt with. (Chris Christie even precipitously switched presidential-candidate best friends.) But no New Yorker can stay a sentimentalist too long. It didnât take much time before the complaints and bickering began, and everything turned darker as the real misery became more apparent. The death toll kept rising as searchers pushed into the worst-hit areasâit stood at 100 people as of Fridayâand some lost everything, over 100 houses in Breezy Point alone. And the city was not exactly overwhelmed with rescue workers and Red Cross trucks. Fury mounted with every hour that electricity and heat and food failed to arrive. In Alphabet City, in Red Hook, out in Staten Island, there were people who needed to fill buckets from hydrants, or scrounge from Dumpsters. By the end of the week, it was clear who was suffering and who had been merely inconvenienced. The news from the outer-boroughs was especially grim; people were fighting over gasoline; scenes from The Road. The images of water pouring into subways and banks, cars submerged on Avenue A, escalators that needed to be ridden with scuba equipment, brought to mind an apocalypse of a specific kind, another lost cityâAtlantis. Was this what New York could become? Itâs hard to remember, a decade after 9/11, how fragile downtown seemed then, and how long it struggled. But one of the many differences between that event and this one is that, for all the struggle, no one doubted for a moment in the months after 9/11 that New York was at the center of the world, which was a consolation, reinforcing the amour-propre that is a city hallmark. Out-of-towners were solicitous for years afterward. Whereas by Thursday of last week, Los Angelenos were already complaining about not getting their calls returned. One of the ways to look at a natural disaster is as a test, a challenge to be met, and by these measures, New York City was succeeding. By weekâs end, normalcy was being returnedâif not yet those L.A. phone calls. The arguing over the marathon was a healthy sign: not could we, but should we? The world should have such troubles. But for hundreds of years, the harbor had given New York its power. In less than 24 hours, it took it away. As we are reminded more and more often these days, it doesnât take long to turn everything on its head.

Millions of people could face flooding and power outages due to the storm Washington's Metro joins New York and Philadelphia in suspending subway runs "It could be bad, or it could be devastation," a Coast Guard official says (CNN) -- Pelting rains, whipping winds, mass evacuations: There is no doubt that Hurricane Sandy, by Sunday, had already made a mammoth impact on the U.S. East Coast. And it should only get worse. That's the consensus view, among forecasters and officials, as the Category 1 storm continued to chug northeastward parallel to the shore. Even with its eye still hundreds of miles away, those on the North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland coasts felt its wrath Sunday. But if, as expected, it turns toward the United States early Monday morning, Sandy will have an even more direct -- and potentially calamitous -- effect on millions. Forecasters warn it will likely collide with a cold front from the West to spawn a "superstorm" that could slog along the Eastern Seaboard for days -- meaning even more wind, flooding, power outages and, with that all, potential danger. "I'm expecting it to be really bad," Paul DiCristina Jr. told CNN affiliate NY1, after prepping his Coney Island restaurant ahead of Sandy. "We're evacuating, we know that for sure, but I'm just hoping there's a restaurant here Wednesday or Thursday." He's not alone in his fears. The National Hurricane Center is warning of no less than a "life-threatening storm surge flooding the Mid-Atlantic coast, including Long Island and New York Harbor," all in addition to sustained winds in excess of 70 mph and even stronger gusts -- conditions that will affect millions of people. "Sandy has a tremendous amount of energy," U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Ratti told CNN. "It could be bad, or it could be devastation." On Sunday alone, power was knocked out in places such as Hampton Roads, Virginia, as rough waves crashed along the coast, said Penelope Penn. Another CNN iReporter, Elizabeth Switzer, reported waves topping 12 feet further south along Carolina Beach outside Wilmington, North Carolina. And by late afternoon, floodwaters washed over roads between Dewey and Bethany beaches in Delaware, said Gov. Jack Markell, adding even more urgency for people to get out before they get trapped. "We're seeing more flooding than you normally do, and particularly since the storm's not here," Markell said around 5 p.m. Sandy took a toll well before its U.S. arrival, causing at least 67 deaths -- including 51 in Haiti -- as it rumbled through the Caribbean. As of 11 p.m. Sunday, Sandy still hadn't veered toward the United States, though the National Hurricane Center said that should happen "during the next several hours." Centered 470 miles south-southeast of New York, the hurricane should make landfall late Monday in southern New Jersey and the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes Delaware and parts of Maryland and Virginia, according to the CNN Weather Unit. One thing that makes this storm unique is not so much its 75 mph sustained winds, but the fact such hurricane-force winds extend 175 miles out from its eye. That portends to affect hundreds of miles of territory, on both sides of Sandy's eye, hit hard by destructive winds, with an even bigger swath getting tropical force-level gusts and drenching rains. Sandy prompted evacuation orders on New Jersey's barrier islands,in downtown Ocean City, Maryland, and in flood-prone coastal communities in southern Delaware. Low-lying areas of New York City, including Coney Island and parts of Manhattan, are being cleared out as well. Jim Brady was among those who heeded the call, leaving his Cape May home about three blocks from the Atlantic and heading 85 miles north to his sister-in-law's house in Toms River. Packing what they can and stashing bigger valuables as high as possible, what happens next is now out of their hands as it may take days before they find out if they've skirted disaster. Across the bay from Brooklyn in Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro pleaded on the plywood that covered up her burger restaurant, "Be kind to us Sandy." The seaside area largely dodged last year's Hurricane Irene, and Cafaro is hoping for -- but not expecting -- any more reprieves. "Everything that we've been watching on the news looks like this one will really get us," she said. "We're definitely worried about it ... Hopefully, she'll spare us." After filling his trunk with sandbags Sunday in Cranston, Rhode Island, resident Steve Pacheco said he has done what he can by clearing Halloween decorations and other items from his yard. Still, for all his preparation, he admits Sandy makes him nervous. Officials from North Carolina to Maine have been raising alarms, and taking preventive steps like the subway shut-downs, for days. By Sunday evening, officials already had canceled classes Monday for well over 2 million public school students in districts such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Baltimore, while numerous universities as well as federal government offices in Washington and government offices in states like New Jersey were preemptively closed. Sandy has even managed to put the presidential election on the back burner, turning campaign plans upside down. Then there are the travel nightmares that the storm has already, and will continue, to cause with thousands of flights called off, Amtrak train runs scuttled, and hundreds of roads and highways expected to flood. A full moon, which always brings out higher than normal tides, should exacerbate storm surge problems on Monday in coastal areas. In addition to one 12 hours earlier, high tide is scheduled for around 8:30 p.m. -- meaning parts of Delaware and New Jersey, for instance, could see significant flooding then even if Sandy has come ashore by then. Irrespective of the tides, the National Weather Service is forecasting potentially harmful storm surges of between 6 to 11 feet in New York Harbor and Long Island Sound. "This is not a typical storm. It could very well be historic in nature and in scope and in magnitude because of the widespread anticipated power outages, flooding and potential major wind damage," Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said, speaking of his state but just as well about many others in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. A mother learns that her newborn is part of a hospital evacuation.

Read More Experts Say Sandy Showed Limits of an Accurate Forecast By Andrew Freedman Published: October 28th, 2013 , Last Updated: October 24th, 2013 Thanks to a vast network of data-gathering instruments on the ground, attached to balloons launched twice daily across the U.S., and orbiting satellites higher in space, along with the sophisticated computer models that run on supercomputers of ever-increasing speed, weather forecasts are more accurate than they have ever been, as was demonstrated with Hurricane Sandy. A week before the “superstorm” devastated the East Coast, the models available to the National Weather Service showed that Hurricane Sandy was going to do something that no storm had ever done — slam into the New Jersey coastline at a nearly 90-degree angle, going from east to west. That track would bring a massive storm surge into New York City, New Jersey, and Long Island, a nearly perfect storm or worst-case scenario. In this 3-D map of potential temperature, relatively cool air wraps around Sandy's core near the surface (purple and blue colors), while air parcels gain heat from moisture condensing into clouds and precipitation as they ascend through the storm’s core. Credit: UCAR. Yet Sandy also demonstrated the frustrating limitations of an accurate forecast. Despite the advanced notice and the huge threat it posed everywhere from Massachusetts to Maryland, the storm still killed 159 people, including 44 within New York City alone. Most of the New York victims drowned from coastal flooding. Even now, nearly a year after Sandy helped reshape the weather enterprise in the U.S., a gap is growing between the capabilities of weather forecasters and the state of risk communications and emergency preparedness in the country. The growing disconnect between what forecasters can do — predict a storm’s path and intensity well in advance — and how the public and officials use that information was driven home by Gary Szatkowski, a meteorologist-in-charge of the NWS’ forecast office outside of Philadelphia, which handles forecasting for the Jersey Shore. More than any other forecaster, Szatkowski sounded the alarm for New Jersey residents in particular, gaining national recognition for his clear, consistent warnings and use of social media to reach the public. At one point prior to the storm, Szatkowski took the extraordinary step of sharing his cell phone number in a public briefing, inviting people to call him directly to complain if Sandy failed to live up to its billing (as Tropical Storm Irene had a year earlier) and they had evacuated their homes, rather than ignoring evacuation orders and risking their lives. "If you think the storm is overhyped and exaggerated, please err on the side of caution," he wrote. "You can call me on Friday and yell at me all you want . . . I will be very happy that you are alive & well, no matter how much you yell at me." Szatkowski said Sandy proved that an accurate forecast is not enough to avoid loss of life and massive damage from an extreme weather event. “I do think Sandy raised the bar regarding weather forecasts and warnings, and more importantly, opened the door to some new questions,” Szatkowski said in an email to Climate Central. “I’ve been drawing the contrast between how accurate the forecast was and how the information was utilized (in some cases, not so well).” In two well-documented gaffes, New Jersey Transit parked dozens of train cars and expensive engines in a low-lying lot in Hoboken that was forecast to flood, ultimately causing more than $120 million in damage. And in New York, officials had to hastily evacuate patients from Coney Island Hospital, Bellevue Hospital, and NYU Langone Medical Center, among other facilities, including patients in critical condition and more than 15 infants in neo-natal intensive care. Bellevue Hospital and NYU Langone Medical Center lost power when floodwaters from the East River breached an electrical substation. “The best technical forecast won’t achieve the desired results if the threat is not understood or not prioritized correctly,” Szatkowski said. “Everywhere it flooded during Sandy was forecast to flood.” “I find our risk assessment as a society is quite interesting,” Szatkowski said. “As a society, we are comfortable with recalling large quantities of food if something inappropriate is found in a bottle or jar. As a society, we are comfortable with closing down a bus or train terminal if an unattended bag or parcel is found. Yet as a society, with a killer hurricane coming up the East Coast, we struggle with evacuation decisions, and protection of expensive infrastructure.” Post-Sandy Focus Is On New Warnings, Communications Hurricane Sandy prompted a number of changes throughout the different corners of the weather community, including the public and private sectors. New emphasis has been placed on improving how severe weather warnings are communicated, and rolling out new forecast products to help the public better understand threats. In addition, more funding has been secured to help shore up weaknesses in U.S. computer modeling and satellite development. If ever there were a weather event designed to be a forecasting success but a communications failure, it was Hurricane Sandy. The storm was complex, owing part of its DNA to a hurricane and part to an extra-tropical nor’easter, and its track had no previous analog that could be compared. It produced up to 3 feet of snow in West Virginia at the same time as it was flooding Lower Manhattan. Plus, it struck just 1 year after the underwhelming Tropical Storm Irene passed over Manhattan, leading people to be more skeptical than usual about the dire forecasts.

On that day, he downplayed the threat posed by the potential storm surge, and did not order large-scale mandatory evacuations. Credit: NYC Mayor's Office. Take the storm surge forecasts, for example. They were accurate, yet they were delivered in a text-based format that made it nearly impossible for most people to understand their implications. The format of the surge forecasts is suspected as being one of the reasons why so many New Yorkers and Jersey Shore residents were caught off guard by the height and force of the storm surge. At The Battery in Lower Manhattan, Hurricane Sandy's storm surge of 9.4 feet contributed to a 13.88 foot storm tide above the normal low tide level. That resulted in an inundation of between 4 to 9 feet above ground level, enough to flood all of the subway tunnels between Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, wipe out homes in Staten Island, and flood neighborhoods like Red Hook in Brooklyn and the Rockaways in Queens. Although the NWS accurately forecast the storm surge magnitude and timing, the agency provided little in the way of graphical guidance for people to envision the impact of storm surge on their neighborhoods. Sans that visual aid, most coastal residents had no way to understand what a particular storm surge height would mean for their homes. “There are ways of getting this mapped more explicitly,” Louis Uccellini, director of the NWS, said in an interview. “We’ve got to get it down to the street level.” Despite the communications shortcomings, Uccellini said the agency's forecasts and warnings saved countless lives. “We also feel that our forecasts and our messaging saved lives. That there were evacuations in areas that if they weren’t evacuated… there would have been many more lives lost.” A post-Sandy federal review of the NWS’ performance found that the forecasts the agency issued, including the surge forecasts, were remarkably accurate, but they were not communicated in ways that made it easy for officials and the public to understand. The confusing surge forecasts may have been partly to blame for why New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg downplayed the storm’s threat on Oct. 27, with less than 48 hours to go until landfall. "It is not expected to be a tropical storm or hurricane-type surge," Bloomberg said at a press conference. "With this storm we're likely to see a slow pileup of water rather than a sudden surge, which is what you would expect from a hurricane and which we saw with Irene 14 months ago, so it will be less dangerous, but make no mistake about it there will be a lot of water and low-lying areas will experience flooding." Spurred by Sandy as well as Hurricane Isaac, which struck Louisiana in 2012, the NWS is developing storm surge warnings as well as mapping tools that will allow forecasters to bring the threat closer to home for the public.

Jamie Rhome, the storm surge lead for the NWS, said that Congress appropriated funds for storm surge forecasting improvements in the wake of Sandy, but that much of the work had already begun before the storm. The $10 million in post-Sandy funds devoted to storm surge modeling will accelerate the development of these warnings and enable the NWS to deliver this nationally earlier than expected. The NWS is also working to roll out experimental inundation graphics in 2014 and storm surge warnings in 2015. These warnings, and the maps used to convey them, are being designed collaboratively between forecasters and risk communication experts. While the NWS and weather community more broadly work to develop better computer models and satellite systems, along with more effective storm warnings, the central lesson from Sandy may not concern any one particular technology or forecast product, or even a single satellite. Rather, as David Bernard, chief meteorologist at CBS’s Miami affiliate, told Climate Central, the problem that forecasters face in future storms is that more progress needs to be made in improving risk communication and threat response. “The meteorology is moving along but our ability to react and prepare is not,” Bernard said. In other words, forecasters are already bumping up against diminishing returns, with improvements failing to translate directly into lives and property saved. Before Sandy, the NWS was already beginning to work with social scientists to help redesign its forecast products and warnings. Post-Sandy, the agency has accelerated such efforts. “(It’s) not just physical science anymore,” Uccellini said of the job of severe weather forecasting at the NWS. “It’s physical science plus social science, if in fact we want people to take the response that we expect when we make the forecast.” “Sandy has gotten academia, the private sector, and federal government to move beyond ‘lip service’ on social science, communications, and related research,” Marshall Shepherd, a professor at the University of Georgia and the president of the American Meteorological Society, said. So far, though, the NWS has not hired any social scientists to work full-time alongside its meteorologists. Instead, the agency is training certain field experts, known as warning coordination meteorologists, to make them aware of the insights that social science research can provide regarding the weather warnings process. “This is going to become an increasingly important part of their job description,” Uccellini said. In addition, storm surge specialists like Rhome are working closely with communications experts to design the storm surge warning products. Bryan Norcross, the senior hurricane specialist at The Weather Channel who was on air throughout Hurricane Sandy, told Climate Central that the meteorological community needs to come to grips with what he says is the sorry state of risk management in the U.S. “It has become frighteningly predictable what the research is going to say after every big storm: most people did not understand the threat. They knew the storm was coming, but they could not translate the avalanche of bulletins, advisories, watches, warnings, and opinions into a clear understanding of the threat to their home and their family,” he said. Shoring Up Critical Weather Infrastructure Before the Next Sandy By ripping apart pieces of the East Coast and causing billions of dollars of damage, Sandy moved the needle on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) funding requests for both computer modeling improvements and satellite development. The storm hit the U.S. at a critical time for the public and private weather sector. A successful weather forecast relies on products from observational systems, like satellites and weather balloons, as well as tools that scoop up that data and make sense of it, feeding it into sophisticated computer models that assist human forecasters in making a prediction. Life cycle of Hurricane Sandy: Surface Wind Speeds. Credit: UCAR. If any one of these three critical areas — observations, data assimilation, and computing capacity — are lagging, then forecasts could suffer, Uccellini said. Before Sandy hit, NOAA was growing increasingly concerned about its declining computing capacity relative to other nations, as well as its troubled satellite development program. The agency faced a political climate that was toxic to any requests for funding increases, especially for programs that could be spun as “climate-related,” which earned the suspicion of many Members of Congress who are skeptical of the existence of manmade global warming. Sandy provided NOAA with a powerful argument to use on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers had been harshly critical of the agency’s mismanagement of the satellite program, in particular, and largely unaware of the supercomputing lead other nations were opening over the U.S. As they had done after previous major storms, NOAA officials went before lawmakers and showed them how much less accurate the forecast would have been had the computer models been deprived of satellite data. Kathryn Sullivan, the NOAA administrator, touted a study from meteorologists at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England, in which they re-ran their computer model after depriving it of the data that comes from the current fleet of polar-orbiting satellites, and found the forecast would have been hundreds of miles off course. The Hurricane Sandy forecast from ECMWF with and without the polar-orbiting satellite data.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NOAA The test was done because cost overruns, launch setbacks, and bureaucratic delays in the U.S. satellite program threaten to cause a gap of a year or more between when one of the current polar-orbiting satellites — known as the Suomi NPP — reaches the end of its design lifetime in 2016, and when the next polar-orbiting satellite is ready for launch in 2017, at the earliest. Partly as a result of that lobbying push, the continuing resolutions that provided funding for reopening the government following the 16-day shutdown included a provision for keeping satellite funding at levels that would prevent any launch dates from slipping further behind, and there was a similar provision in a bill that funded the government through Fiscal Year 2013. The storm also publicly demonstrated the shortcomings of the premier U.S. forecasting model, known as the Global Forecast System, or GFS, compared to the European’s medium-range model. Meteorologists had known for years that the Euro model often outperformed the GFS, particularly several days in advance of a weather event, but lawmakers and the public were largely unaware. The Euro model picked up the scent of Sandy’s track, including its bizarre left hook into New Jersey, sooner than the GFS model did, providing earlier warning to public officials. It is no accident that Congress has since provided critical support for boosting the agency’s computing capabilities. The NWS is using $25.2 of the $48 million allocated to the NWS in the Sandy relief legislation, along with funds called for in President Obama’s fiscal year 2014 budget proposal, to bring about unprecedented computing upgrades. “We just tripled the size of our operational computer,” Uccellini said, adding that in a year and a half, the agency will add another 10 times the current amount of capacity. “The Sandy supplemental allowed us to break through the glass ceiling,” Uccellini said of the NWS’ computing capabilities. “I thank the Hill every time I get the chance for supporting that.” The new money will allow the NWS to go from an operational computing capacity of 213 peak teraflops at the end of the current fiscal year, to 1,950 peak teraflops by the end of fiscal year 2015. A teraflop is a measure of how many calculations a computer can make per second, and indicates that a computer can make one trillion “floating point calculations” in just one second. But as Sandy sadly showed, all that computing power doesn’t mean anything if the message isn’t communicated well and heeded by public officials and the people in harms’ way.

Hurricane Sandy exits the Caribbean Hurricane Sandy at landfall in Cuba around 1:30am Eastern Time October 25th. GOES imagery. Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba around 1:30am this morning. According to the National Hurricane Center, Sandy had 110mph winds and a minimum central pressure near 957mb at landfall. The storm came ashore just to the west of the city of Santiago de Cuba where sustained winds of 78mph gusting to 114mph with a pressure of 960mb was reported before the station stopped reporting so conditions were likely worse than this at the height of the storm. A storm surge between 4 and 7 feet likely occurred near this city. Yesterday evening, Sandy exited the coast of Jamaica and underwent rapid intensification where the central pressure fell from 970mb to 954mb in six hours before its Cuba landfall. Sandy has since emerged from Cuba and has weakened slightly to a 100mph, 967mb storm. Some re-strengthening is already occurring as the storm heads northwards in an area that appears to be favorable for tropical cyclone development. The Bahamas are going to get the worst of Sandy today as this dangerous storm moves through the islands into the West Atlantic. As of 11am, Sandy had 105mph sustained winds and a minimum central pressure of 964mb. Forecast track… Sandy is expected to move northwards through the central Bahamas today and northwestwards into Northwestern Bahamas this evening, nearing the Florida coast in response to an approaching trough over the central US. From there, Sandy should be turned back towards the north-northeast as the trough starts to move off the East coast of the US, without a Florida landfall, and start to move into the Western Atlantic near the US East coast. On Sunday, Sandy is expected to turn back to the north and approach New England as it gets absorbed into/absorbs the trough over the Northeastern States. What to expect… Caribbean: Tropical storm conditions are starting to subside in Cuba and Haiti so warnings have been discontinued there, but heavy rain lingers in Haiti and the Dominican Republic where total rainfall accumulations are expected to be 12-18inches with isolated areas of 20inches in the mountains – life threatening flash flooding and mudslides may result, especially on Hispaniola. Bahamas: Hurricane conditions will be occurring in some of the islands of the central and northwestern Bahamas today and into tomorrow morning as Sandy moves through the island chain, Hurricane Warnings are in effect there. Storm surges up to 8 feet are possible in the Bahamas where onshore eyewall winds occur. Heavy rain of 3-6 inches is expected to cause some localized flooding in combination with storm surges. Florida: Late tonight and on Friday, tropical storm conditions may occur on the east coast of Florida where Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings are in effect from the Florida Keys to north of Melbourne. Up to three inches of rain are possible in Florida from the squally outer bands of Sandy. Some modest sea level rises and extremely rough surf will cause extensive beach erosion and very dangerous rip currents as the storm passes. Bermuda: Sandy may be large enough and head far enough eastwards to bring strong or even tropical storm force winds to Bermuda this weekend and into early next week along with some squally showers and very rough surf. New England: Early next week, after the Sandy moves away from the Bahamas, Florida, and Bermuda, it is expected to take aim on New England as it merges into a stalled trough that is expected to set up there. This is after day five in the forecast, so there is a very high degree of uncertainty in this track, but even more so because this situation is so delicate that any slight change in the trajectory after day five will send the storm into a different area of the coast. Regardless, expect a very severe Ocean Storm that may be comparable to the Perfect Storm in 1991, except expect Sandy to move inland and bring coastal flooding, tropical storm or hurricane force winds, heavy flooding rain, and as cold air from Canada associated with the trough moves in, some snow in the interior Northeast, especially in the Mountains.

Read More Stunning NASA Visualizations: Sandy vs. Katrina By Andrew Freedman Published: November 6th, 2012 , Last Updated: November 6th, 2012 Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall near Atlantic City on Oct. 29, brought tropical storm force winds to a vast area that stretched nearly 1,000 miles across. The size of the storm enabled it to drive a record high storm surge into the New Jersey coast, New York City, and parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island. At The Battery in Lower Manhattan, the water reached a record 13.88 feet above the average low tide, which included a 9.23-foot storm surge. At the time of landfall, Sandy was completing its transition from a purely tropical system, fed by warm ocean waters, to what is known as an extratropical cyclone — a low-pressure area fueled by temperature contrasts between warm and cool air masses. The transition stretched Sandy into more of a comma shape than a round shape, bringing the storm's impacts to a broader area than a typical hurricane. NASA put together two visualizations to show how Hurricane Sandy — which is likely to go down in history as one of the costliest hurricanes to strike the U.S. — compared to the storm that currently occupies the top spot on that list, Hurricane Katrina. According to NASA: "The map of Sandy’s winds (top), produced with data from a radar scatterometer on the Indian Space Research Organization’s (ISRO) Oceansat-2, shows the strength and direction of Sandy’s ocean surface winds on October 28. The map of Hurricane Katrina’s winds was made from similar data acquired on Aug. 28, 2005, by a radar scatterometer on NASA’s retired QuickSCAT satellite. In both maps, wind speeds above 40 mph are yellow; above 50 mph are orange; and above 60 mph are dark red." The visualizations show that both the extent and location of the strongest winds differed greatly between these two damaging storms. In the case of Katrina, tropical storm force winds stretched "about 300 miles from edge to edge," and the strongest winds were located within a circle of towering thunderstorms surrounding the storm center, known as the eyewall. But with Sandy, tropical storm force winds extended a whopping 900 miles away from the storm, and the most intense winds were located well away from the storm's center.
Recovery Remains Spotty 3 Months After Hurricane A stretch of Front Street in the South Street Seaport area, a part of Lower Manhattan that continues to suffer from the effects of Hurricane Sandy.Credit Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York and New Jersey nearly three months ago, and the grueling recovery effort continues with work being done to repair, rebuild and reopen shattered homes and businesses. But the process has been uneven, and there is ample evidence that many people are still struggling in the aftermath of one of the most vicious storms to hit the region. Following are snapshots of how some people and places are faring on the road back. LOWER MANHATTAN Headaches Persist in Lower Manhattan After Hurricane Lower Manhattan enjoyed one of the shortest recovery times in the region, with electricity returning to most of the area less than a week after Hurricane Sandy flooded streets from the financial district to Greenwich Village. Seawater crippled utility systems in many basements, keeping both businesses and residents from returning to buildings that lacked power, water, heat or other basic services several weeks after the hurricane. But most of those buildings were able to reopen by the beginning of January, said Liz Berger, president of the Downtown Alliance. Community leaders say most small businesses are open again, with the prominent exception of South Street Seaport, where the retail area known as Pier 17 and the South Street Seaport Museum are back in business but much of the district is still shuttered. And it has been nearly three months since residents of 2 Gold and its neighbor, 201 Pearl Street, have lived in their own apartments; the buildings’ owners said recently that they hoped to move people back in by March 1 after rebuilding the basement electrical systems and boiler. Smaller headaches linger, a daily reminder of the way the hurricane paralyzed life here: the South Ferry subway station was so damaged that it has been closed indefinitely, a few businesses are still cash-only as they await the return of their credit lines, and some still lack phone service. Such problems have prompted Verizon to replace all of its underground copper wiring, ruined by the floodwaters, with modern fiber-optic cables, a process it has told downtown leaders will be nearly done by the end of the month. Glance down the main strip in Hoboken, N.J., and Hurricane Sandy might seem a distant memory. Businesses are open along Washington Street. The movie theater reopened in late December. So did the PATH station, after two months in which commuters struggled to find other ways to work and, with fewer people walking to the trains, stores and restaurants lost about 70 percent of their business. But if the storm’s devastation here is not as obvious as it is in beach towns, it still runs deep. The floodwaters spared the waterfront and Washington Street, but came rushing over the north and south ends of the city, overwhelming neighborhoods that on a map might look landlocked and less vulnerable. Along inland streets, many stores and restaurants remain closed, and contractors’ trucks remove debris from homes and businesses that had to be gutted after the storm flooded them with several feet of water and sewage. The biggest problems remain for about 1,700 businesses and homes in what real estate agents delicately call garden-level units. Flood insurance policies consider them basements and cover damage only to things like boilers and water heaters, even if the basement happens to be a primary residence, as it is for many here. These units’ owners are left to apply for grants to get a piece of the aid package Congress passed. But the grants are unlikely to cover all their costs. “It’s an unfair system,” Mayor Dawn Zimmer said. “People are feeling like, ‘Why am I forced to pay for flood insurance that won’t give me coverage?’ ” It is up to Congress, she said, to change the rules for flood insurance so basement apartments and homes have the same coverage. Photo Many businesses and homeowners in Hoboken, N.J., are struggling to obtain compensation for damage caused by the storm.Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times — KATE ZERNIKE • STATEN ISLAND Slow Recovery From Hurricane for Some Staten Island Residents Recovery on Staten Island, which suffered extensive damage to its beach communities, has been quick for some residents of the hardest-hit areas but slow for many others. New York City officials estimated that nearly 6,000 buildings in the borough sustained damage or disruption to utility services, driving occupants to seek temporary lodging elsewhere. Since then, tons of debris have been cleared from the borough’s streets. power and heat have been restored to most properties, and a majority of homes damaged by the storm have been reoccupied. But hundreds of families are still struggling. In the Midland Beach neighborhood, residents have moved back into most of the newer multilevel homes, which were spared the worst of the storm surge, while many of the low-slung single-story bungalows remain dark. Contractors have completed repairs on more than half of the 2,400 or so structures in the borough registered for the city’s Rapid Repairs program, said Peter Spencer, spokesman for the mayor’s Office of Housing Recovery, but work has yet to begin on more than one-fourth of them. City officials also estimate that about 300 buildings are still without power or heat. Another 200 are uninhabitable because they were destroyed or rendered structurally unsound. Mr. Spencer said the planned demolition of about 100 structures on the island began last week and was expected to continue at a pace of about a dozen a day. In an effort to assess residents’ needs, a coalition of more than 50 religious groups was dispatching volunteers to go door-to-door in the borough’s beach communities and conduct “a three-month, where-are-we” survey, said the Rev. Terry Troia, executive director of Project Hospitality, an interfaith organization on Staten Island. “There’s one little old lady who’s living in mold and won’t come out and has a sign on her door that says, ‘I’m O.K.,’ ” Ms. Troia said. “That person’s a cause for concern.” She added, “We want to find out how many other little old ladies there are.” — KIRK SEMPLE • GERRITSEN BEACH ‘More or Less Back to Normal’ George Broadhead, the head of the Gerrittsen Beach Property Owners Association in Brooklyn, got steam heat percolating in his house after New Year’s Day, having survived for two months on a space heater and sleepovers at friends. His status — improving, but not quite whole — is emblematic of the entire enclave of 2,300 closely packed, low-lying seaside bungalows that was swamped by Hurricane Sandy. Mr. Broadhead is pleased that the mounds of waterlogged furniture and wallboards are gone, that a bus dispatched by Coney Island Hospital outfitted with doctors and medical supplies is helping older people like himself nurse their colds and other ailments and that a hall run by the community’s volunteer firefighters is dispensing food to those who have not restored their stoves and refrigerators. Photo High school students from Westchester County, doing volunteer work on Sunday, gutted a damaged home in Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn.Credit Kirsten Luce for The New York Times But the flip side of all that help is that people are still hurting, so Mr. Broadhead’s tentative words to describe himself — “more or less back to normal” — fit the neighborhood. Jim Donovan, a contractor who is chairman of the private Cort Club, said “Gerritsen Beach is going great, but we still have a tremendous mold problem.” Perhaps 20 percent of the area’s homes are still unlivable, Mr. Donovan estimated. He has been promised money from organizations like Rebuilding Together NYC to help neighbors install walls and replace appliances, and is taking applications. Backed up toilets; weeks of no heat, running water, electricity or elevators; pitch-black hallways; elderly and infirm residents marooned on upper floors without food, water or means of egress — all counted among the miseries Hurricane Sandy brought to residents of seafront public housing buildings. The New York City Housing Authority came faced criticism, most recently at a City Council hearing, for being poorly prepared for the storm and its aftermath. In the days after the storm, many residents relied heavily, if not solely, on volunteers going door to door bearing meals, blankets, bottled water and medicine. Life has since returned to a dissatisfactory normal for most people living in public housing. Lights and heat are back on, though 10 buildings in Red Hook, Coney Island and the Rockaways still have mobile boilers, run by generators. “Sometimes you don’t have water for three days, sometimes it’s scalding hot,” said Miriam Williams, 47, whose mother lives in Red Hook Houses. Ann Valdez, who lives in Coney Island Houses, cited an influx of water bugs, cockroaches and mice. Vernell Robinson, 50, a health counselor who lives in Arverne and whose building lobby was filled with two feet of water, said, “You can imagine what Sandy brought along with it.” Many residents used their meager savings to replace spoiled food and in some cases find shelter. In Long Beach, N.Y., about 40 percent of the population has not returned after Hurricane Sandy, officials in this Long Island community said. There is little to come back to. Houses inundated by the storm surge are still waterlogged and molding. For those who remain, a kind of depressed insularity has set in, as if time froze as the floodwaters withdrew. “On the weekends I go out of town because it’s sad here,” said Carlos Ferreiro, an owner of a clothing store called NY Threads. Photo Anne Louis looked at clothes last week inside a community center in Long Beach, N.Y. The hurricane flooded her home.Credit Kirsten Luce for The New York Times “Outside people talk about gun control and the debt,” he added. “Here, people are all talking about the same thing” — meaning, the storm. Mr. Ferreiro’s house remains unlivable, and his business is on shaky ground. He said he would try to endure another three months and then reassess. Other business owners have given in and closed down, he said. “We decided to stick it out,” he said. “We’ll see what happens.” With their kitchens out of order and restaurants too expensive, many residents in the low-income North Park neighborhood still rely on warm meals provided by a local community center. Since the storm hit in late October, Thelma Graham, 67, has been having meals at the center with the 13-year-old granddaughter she cares for. She also acquired a winter coat and boots from donated clothing still piled on tables on the center’s basketball court. She said life was difficult but improving. After living in a rental apartment for months, she moved back into her newly refurbished home just before the new year. She still has no furniture in her living room, but said she did not mind that too much. “Thank God we have our lives,” she said. “The material stuff can be put back slowly.” — MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ • HOWARD BEACH Struggling to Return to Normal After Hurricane Sandy Most of the waterfront pizza parlors, nail salons and restaurants on Cross Bay Boulevard, a main thoroughfare in Howard Beach have reopened for business, despite extensive water damage and electrical repairs. Who in the southwest Queens neighborhood can forget the crowds that showed up at Gino’s, the first pizzeria to fuel up a generator the weekend after Hurricane Sandy brought a bay of water down area streets? The delight over the availability of hot Italian food and even catering hall space has been replaced with disappointment that many chain stores, including Duane Reade, 7-Eleven, Petco and Staples, largely have not scrambled with the same determined fervor to reopen. Sharon De Riso, a Howard Beach native who manages Clear Water Pools, said, “Many of the small business owners took a long time to reopen, because they also had destroyed homes they needed to tend to.” But Clear Water, which had its roof torn off, never closed and has served about 600 customers since the storm, she said. Ms. De Riso said she was thrilled to see that CVS finally opened on Wednesday. State Senator Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. said recovery in Howard Beach had been slow, and he estimated that about one-third of the area’s businesses were still closed. Duane Reade, he said, confirmed that it would not reopen, but promised to reassign the employees. (The company had already donated $25,000 to the local volunteer fire department.) “It’s important for these businesses to open, important for our community to regain a sense of normalcy and important for people’s jobs,” Mr. Addabbo said. — FRANCES ROBLES A version of this article appears in print on January 22, 2013, on Page A26 of the New York edition with the headline: Recovery Remains Spotty 3 Months After Hurricane.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Saturday, October 27, 2012 Hurricane Warnings Will NOT Be Issued for the Northeast I apologize for the confusion but here is the final word from Dennis Feltgen, head of public relations for the National Hurricane Center. Mike, We will put something on our website and FB page soon to explain this. But the bottom line is that a hurricane watch/warning for the coast cannot be issued if it is not a hurricane. It has to be handled by the other NWS watch/warnings products -Dennis Thanks, Dennis! That said, I strongly disagree with this decision for the reasons stated earlier. For the purposes of this blog, I will continue to refer to the swirl of clouds that is Hurricane Sandy as Hurricane Sandy. Addition: Here is the problem in a nutshell. This was just (2:17pm CDT) cut and pasted from the NWS. Note the (brown) high wind watch inland. But, there is no high wind watch or warning for Long Island or NYC!!! There is little QC or consistency between local NWS offices.
Millions of east coast residents were expected to wake up on Tuesday to power outages, flooded subways, blocked roads and fallen trees. Thousands of planes were grounded in the US. At least 45 UK flights to the east coast did not depart. While there were no immediate confirmations of casualties, one man was reportedly killed by falling trees in Queens, New York and another in rising floodwaters in neighbouring New Jersey. “Barriers had been blown away by #sandy,” he tweeted. “Cops not getting out of their cars.” ‘Steer clear of windows’ The hurricane strengthened as it headed for land with winds at 90 mph reaching as high as 110 mph. Battery Park in lower Manhattan was under about four inches of water early last night but there were predictions it would rise to at least a foot overnight. The situation was changing by the minute. “Stay away from windows and close the drapes if you haven’t already,” New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned residents. Some 47,000 Con Ed were without power in New York and the company warned they might shut down power in lower Manhattan to prevent damage to equipment. President Barack Obama urged people to listen to local officials. He suspended campaigning and returned to Washington to oversee the emergency response to the hurricane, which last night was downgraded to a tropical storm. Republican rival Mitt Romney curtailed political events to show respect for the storm’s potential victims. Manhattan hit hard Larger cities on the east coast appear to have been hard hid but with so many power cuts it was difficult to gather information. Ferocious winds and storms resulted in at least one building collapse in Chelsea, lower Manhattan. A crane was hanging perilously over a luxury building in mid-town early in the evening and a restaurant on the upper west side in the 90s collapsed, according to the New York Fire Department and local news. Entire towns next door in New Jersey were reportedly under water and some areas were unreachable. Police said they were pulling people from trucks and trying to find stragglers on the streets to bring them to safety. It was impossible to move in Atlantic City, New Jersey, a mecca for east coast gamblers and casinos. “There’s nowhere to go. You can’t get out of Atlantic City,” said Montgomery Dahm, owner of Tun Tavern. He said he planned to remain open to feed emergency workers and media crews looking for shelter. Widespread property damage There were reports of widespread destruction to properties along the east coast, including in Philadelphia, New York and Connecticut, some of the most expensive real estate in the US. Winds of 84 mph were reported in Connecticut. The state of Delaware, south of Atlantic City, reported seven inches of rain in one day. “Hurricane Sandy is phenomenally big,” Channel 4 News Weather Reporter Liam Dutton said last night on Twitter. He said hurricane-force and tropical storm-force winds stretched 175 miles and 485 miles from the centre respectively. State governors from Virginia to Massachusetts warned of the acute danger from the storm for residents in its path. At least 10 states had declared a state of emergency on Monday. US stock markets closed for the first time since the 11 September 2001 attacks when New York voluntarily shut down the NYSE. Schools were cancelled up and down the east coast. $45bn to rebuild Sandy was forecast to cause up to US$45 in losses and damage, and lost output from the region could cost up to $10bn a day, according to a Reuters report. Insurance companies were bracing to face their largest losses on record. Even with severe damage, the economic devastation was seen to be short-term, however. Gross domestic product in the region between New York and Washington amounts to some $2.5 trillion, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Economists say some of the impact caused by businesses closing will be offset by reconstruction efforts, and point to catastrophic storms like Katrina, which devastated New Orleans but did not deal lasting damage to the national economy. Damage caused by last year’s Hurricane Irene totalled as much as $20bn and damage from Katrina in 2005 exceeded $100bn by most accounts. A final figure was impossible to predict as the storm appeared to be moving from the US coast north to Ontario, Canada and into the east coast. The cost of a hurricane The trading floors at the New York Stock Exchange are eerily quiet, their first weather-related shutdown for 27 years, which will now last into tomorrow. Major business activities have also been disrupted as banks closed down and many companies told staff to work from home. The Department of Labour says it is working hard to make sure that the monthly jobs report comes out on time on Friday, after reports that the crucial economic data release could be delayed until after the election. The cost of wind damage alone could reach $3bn, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while meteorologist Mike Smith from AccuWeather told USA Today: “I expect the total damage (including loss to the US economy) to be worse than Katrina.” In other words, it could all cost more than $100bn in damage. The New York governor’s office has warned that storm surges could send flood waters rising up to 11 feet along some coastal areas, as Governor Andrew Cuomo warned: “In a situation like this, you prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.” Latest reports from the city show flooded streets in parts of Brooklyn, while a live webcam at New York harbour is providing a front-row view of the action. Further along the coast, Connecticut’s governor Dan Malloy had an even more dire warning: “This is the most catastrophic event that we have faced and been able to plan for in any of our lifetimes.” In New Jersey, where the eye of the storm is due to make landfall, Atlantic City is underwater and under a night-time curfew, while floodwater is also surging through the streets of Ocean City in Maryland: state officials warned it was inevitable that lives would be lost. Out at sea, the US coastguard says 14 people who abandoned ship after the replica HMS Bounty lost power and began taking on water, off the coast of North Carolina have been safely rescued. The search continues for two crew members who are still unaccounted for. Campaigning on hold President Obama, treading a delicate balance between the final, crucial days of the election campaign and taking charge in a national disaster, cancelled a scheduled campaign event in Florida, heading straight for the situation room in the White House. Switching instantly into commander-in-chief mode, he talked of long term power outages and transportation problems, but declared: “The great thing about America is we all pull together, we look out for our friends, we look out for our neighbours.” Asked about the likely impact on the election, he was quick to quash any notion of party politics. “I’m not worried about the effect on the election,” he said. “I’m worried about the effect on families, on first responders, on the economy… the election will take care of itself next week”. Mitt Romney, in Ohio, also announced he would be cancelling all campaign events tonight and tomorrow, out of “sensitivity” for the millions of Americans who could be in harm’s way. His campaign team in Virginia has been collecting donations to hand over to those worst affected by the storm. Early voting has been suspended in Maryland, while Connecticut has extended its voter registration deadline until 1 November. Gallup and other polling companies are suspending their activities. In effect, though, Hurricane Sandy has frozen the election campaign in time, at a moment when it could hardly be more critical. Hurricane Sandy in numbers:– 375,000 evacuated in lower Manhattan and other parts of New York City– 50,000 evacuated in Delaware– 30,000 evacuated in Atlantic City, New Jersey– 7,500 flights cancelled– 800 miles of coastland expected to be affected– 14 US Coast Guard crew members rescued off the coast of North Carolina– 2 more crew members remain missing. Days-long disaster Meanwhile, officials have warned people not just to focus on the eye of the storm, devastating though that is: this is one disaster that could last for days. As yet, power companies say 45,000 people are without power, but they have warned that supplies to millions of people could be cut, while conditions will hamper recovery and rescue efforts as the heavy rains and winds move slowly across a vast area. The latest from New York is that the main Holland and Battery tunnels will close at 2pm this afternoon. The bridges into Manhattan remain open for now, but developments are being closely monitored. Connecticut is closing its highways at lunchtime, while severe driving restrictions in Delaware mean only emergency staff can be on the roads. Stay home, stay safe, is the message – do not put lives at risk by venturing out without good reason. Outside, it seems most people are heeding that warning. A sign at Washington’s normally busy Union Station said it all: every train was cancelled. The departure halls were deserted. Meanwhile the rain lashes down, and things, they say, can only get worse.
New York Region Faces Rescues, Looting and a Rising Death Toll In New Jersey, where flooding destroyed large parts of areas like Hoboken and Mantoloking, above, over two million people were without power on Wednesday.Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times New York faced the reality of life after Hurricane Sandy on Wednesday: horror in still-waterlogged neighborhoods, where rescue workers pulled bodies from wreckage, and exasperation elsewhere as more than 3.75 million people entered a third day without electricity. The storm was blamed for more than 70 deaths in the United States , including 24 in New York City , 8 in New Jersey and 4 in Connecticut . And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said initial damage estimates “project up to $6 billion in lost economic revenue” in New York State . The death toll seemed certain to rise as rescuers checked basements that had flooded, trapping homeowners inside. The wall of water driven ashore by the storm even flooded three police stations, two in Brooklyn and one in the Rockaway section of Queens . Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said a steamfitter was rescued from one station house as water crashed in. The steamfitter, whom he identified as Kevin Hunter, had been working in the boiler room, two levels below the first floor, trying to shut off steam pipes before the surge of cold water rolled in. But Mr. Hunter’s leg became caught, and he was “completely submerged underwater, unable to get free,” Mr. Browne said in an e-mail. Another steamfitter, Anthony DiMaggio, sought help, and he and Lt. Peter O’Neill freed his leg and carried him out in chest-high water. With help from other officers, “they literally swam Hunter to Neptune Avenue, where the water wasn’t as high,” Mr. Browne said. Eventually they loaded him onto a city bus that carried them out of the flooded area, and later into an ambulance that took him to Maimonides Hospital. He was treated for cuts, muscle strains and hypothermia . Video Update on Hurricane Sandy — 5:30 P.M. TimesCast: The latest updates on the recovery efforts in New York City and beyond. Fifteen people in the Far Rockaway section of Queens and nine in Coney Island were charged with burglary and other offenses in connection with looting at stores. Among them was a 29-year-old woman who faced a weapons charge “after the safe she was carrying from a store was found to contain a firearm,” Mr. Browne said. For those who did not have basements that flooded or buildings that slipped off their foundations, there were lines at the gasoline stations that have power to pump fuel for generators and for cars. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie ’s office warned drivers to be careful because lines were so long that they had stretched onto the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. One Twitter feed that had been following the hurricane on the Jersey Shore began sending out updates about where to buy gas. A wide stretch of Lower Manhattan remained dark, as did the Jersey Shore, waterfront neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, and most of Long Island . But the first section of Manhattan that lost power on Monday night, after an explosion and fire at a substation on East 14th Street, had had its lights turned back on, a Consolidated Edison executive said. Doing that restored power to about 2,000 of more than 220,000 customers below 39th Steet in Manhattan. The rest will probably have to wait until Friday or Saturday, said John Miksad, Con Ed’s senior vice president for electric operations. Power also returned to the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. But repairing all of the downed wires in other boroughs and in Westchester County could take another week, Mr. Miksad said. In New Jersey, executives at Public Service Electric and Gas Company said 900,000 customers were still without power, down from a peak of 1.7 million on Tuesday. Some of the company’s main lines, carrying power to substations for local distribution, still needed to be repaired, officials said. But they said electricity was on again in Newark, Elizabeth and parts of Jersey City, and they expected to have all power restored by Nov. 9. Hurricane Sandy: View From Above Connecticut Light and Power reported that more than 318,000 customers were out, including about two-thirds of its customers in Greenwich and New Canaan and 9 out of 10 in Weston. Mr. Cuomo said restoring power to Long Island, where the storm knocked out power to 90 percent of the Long Island Power Authority ’s customers, posed particular difficulties. He said 1,800 utility workers from other areas, mostly upstate, were being sent there to provide extra help. It was clear that it would be a while before many of the small businesses that were so much a part of the city — visually, with their kaleidoscope of street-level storefronts, and economically — recovered. It was just as clear that it would be days before many restaurants reopened. Some lost large inventories when the power went out and food in their walk-in refrigerators began to spoil. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Some lost more than food. Before the storm, Andrew Carmellini, the chef at the Dutch in SoHo and Locanda Verde in TriBeCa, rented a car for around-town transportation. He left it on West 23rd Street. “The car got destroyed in the flood,” he said. “The water went over the dashboard.” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said his evacuation orders remained in effect for low-lying communities from Coney Island in Brooklyn to Battery Park City in Manhattan. Mr. Bloomberg said they would not be lifted until the Buildings Department had had time to inspect buildings in those areas. “I know it’s annoying to everyone,” he said at a briefing, “but we don’t need more loss of life.” Would the city be back to normal? Perhaps, he said — but not for families who were missing a child, a parent, a brother, a sister. “For all we do to recover, it’s fair to say we can’t replace the lives of the people lost in the storm,” he began, speaking in a softer voice than he had used at earlier briefings. “Any loss of life is tragic; sadly, nature is dangerous, and these things occur. The best thing we can do for those who did die is make sure this city recovers for those who come out of this and build a better life for those left behind.” A version of this article appears in print on November 1, 2012, on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Region Faces Rescues, Looting, and a Rising Death Toll.

Hoboken After Hurricane Sandy HOBOKEN, N.J. — New Jersey was reeling on Wednesday from the impact of Hurricane Sandy, which has caused catastrophic flooding here in Hoboken and in other New York City suburbs, destroyed entire neighborhoods across the state and wiped out iconic boardwalks in shore towns that had enchanted generations of vacationgoers. Though the storm raged up the East Coast, it has become increasingly apparent that New Jersey took the brunt of it. Officials estimated that the state suffered many billions of dollars in property damage. More than two million customers remained without power on Wednesday, about half of those in the state. More than 6,000 people were still in shelters, state emergency officials said. At least eight people died, and officials expressed deep concerns that the toll would rise as more searches of homes were carried out. On Wednesday, President Obama visited the state and viewed the destruction with Gov. Chris Christie. “The entire country has been watching what’s been happening,” Mr. Obama said at a stop in Atlantic County at the Brigantine Beach Community Center in Brigantine. “Everybody knows how hard Jersey has been hit.” Perhaps as startling as the sheer toll was the devastation to some of the state’s well-known locales. Boardwalks along the beach in Seaside Heights, Belmar and other towns on the Jersey Shore were blown away. Amusement parks, arcades and restaurants all but vanished. Bridges to barrier islands buckled, preventing residents from even inspecting the damage to their property. Localities across New Jersey imposed curfews to prevent looting. In Monmouth, Ocean and other counties, people waited for hours for gasoline at the few stations that had electricity. Supermarket shelves were stripped bare. Photo People used improvised plastic bags to navigate flood waters in Hoboken.Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times Two days after Hurricane Sandy struck, such distress was not limited to New Jersey. Others parts of the Northeast, including Long Island, also suffered significant losses. Over all, the death toll from the storm passed 60, officials said Wednesday, and about six million people did not have power. One of the most pressing crises was unfolding here in Hoboken, a city of 50,000 that is directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan. “This is flooding like we’ve never seen,” said Mayor Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, where National Guard troops on Wednesday were trying to rescue thousands of residents trapped by sewage-laced floodwaters. “It filled the city like a bathtub,” she said. When the storm surge hit on Monday night, the Hudson overcame the sea wall at the north and south ends of the city in a devastating westward torrent that made an island of the slightly higher, eastern half of the city. After Ms. Zimmer appealed for aid on Tuesday, saying that as many as 20,000 people could be stuck in their homes, the first National Guard trucks arrived just before midnight. Overnight, they responded to emergency messages to find people and transport them to dry ground. On the city’s Facebook page, officials called on residents in need to listen for the trucks’ approach. By midday on Wednesday, 12 National Guard trucks and two Humvee vehicles were in Hoboken for the rescue effort. City officials have not reported any fatalities in Hoboken so far. Photo An aerial view of storm damage on the Atlantic coast.Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Among the first to be rescued during the night were two babies, one 5 days old and another 3 weeks old. By midday Wednesday, the trucks at the unloading point by City Hall were bringing older people, including several in wheelchairs, and many families with babies and small children. Robyn Pecarsky, who was eight months pregnant, was helped down from the back of a truck with her two children, who are 5 and 8. “We saw the National Guard, and I sent my husband to tell them he had to get his pregnant wife out,” Ms. Pecarsky said. She said the family lived in a third-floor apartment on Jackson Street that was not damaged, but as of this morning the water remained at thigh-high level on the ground floor of the building. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. She said that the children had been in the house under the curfew since Monday, and that nerves were raw. When she heard that power, which remained out in much of Hoboken, might not return for days, she decided that the family had to leave. City officials were worried because the floodwaters are a brew of rain and river water mixed with sewage, Ms. Zimmer said. A sewage plant on the west side of the city had been overwhelmed in the flood, she said. Many power lines were down on the largely residential west side. Although power remained out in many parts of the city, there was concern that some fallen wires might remain active. Photo Nick Parise, from Edgewater, N.J., gave a lift to Carley Keefe, front, and Caitlin Schell in Hoboken, N.J.Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times The PATH train station, on the south end of the city, remained closed after water from the Hudson rushed in Monday night. Port Authority officials said the PATH tunnel under the river was filled with water. Many commuters use the system to get to work in Manhattan. Interviewed in the basement of City Hall, where rescue officials in a makeshift operations center were down to one working phone line on Tuesday, the mayor said the city had only a single pump station on the south end of town to drain its streets and, eventually, its basements. In Sayreville, across Raritan Bay from Staten Island, the foundations of several homes were washed away, following the rush of a five-foot surge that had marooned some 200 people who were rescued, mostly by boat. Mr. Christie visited the area, and several women cried in his arms as they told him how much they had lost. The governor alternatively embraced them, put his hands on both shoulders and spoke softly with an arm around their backs. “I don’t feel safe in my house and I don’t know what to do,” said one of them, Elaine Konopka. As the governor walked down the street, he approached several people who wanted to show him their homes. “Please help us,” Theresa Mills said. “That’s what I’m here to do,” he responded. Correction: November 2, 2012 Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the devastation in New Jersey caused by Hurricane Sandy misstated the extent of power failures. Officials said more than two million customers — not people — lost power in the storm. (That total is about half the number of customers in the state.) An accompanying picture caption repeated the error and also misidentified the flooded area shown. The destruction was in Mantoloking, N.J., not in Seaside Heights.

Soldiers and rescue workers clear up after hurricane Sandy in Santiago de Cuba on Thursday. Photograph: Franklin Reyes/AP Hurricane Sandy has lashed the central Bahamas with violent winds and torrential rains after raging through the Caribbean, where it caused at least 21 deaths and forced the postponement of a hearing at the Guantánamo naval base on Cuba. State media in Cuba said houses were destroyed and 11 people killed in the eastern provinces of Santiago and Guantánamo as the category-two storm swept over the island on Thursday. Nine deaths were reported in Haiti and one in Jamaica. By late on Thursday, Sandy had slowed to a category-one hurricane, but forecasters warned it was likely to combine with a winter storm to cause a super storm in the eastern US next week, whose effects would be felt along the entire Atlantic coast and inland to Ohio. Some further weakening of the hurricane was forecast during the next 48 hours, but it was expected to remain a hurricane. Late on Thursday, the hurricane's centre was 185 miles east-southeast of Freeport on Grand Bahama island as it spun between Cat Island and Eleuthera in the central Bahamas. The storm's maximum sustained winds had fallen to 90mph, with Sandy moving north-northwest at 13mph. Caroline Turnquest, head of the Red Cross in the Bahamas archipelago off Florida's east coast, said 20 shelters were opened on the main island of New Providence. "Generally people are realising it is serious," she said. Power was out on Acklins Island and most roads there were flooded, government administrator Berkeley Williams said. His biggest concern was that a boat filled with basic supplies for the island had to cancel its trip until next week. "Supplies were low before, so you can imagine what we are going through now," Williams said. The only school on Ragged Island in the southern Bahamas was flooded. "We have holes in roofs, lost shingles and power lines are down," said Charlene Bain, the local Red Cross president. "But nobody lost a life, that's the important thing." Steven Russell, an emergency management official in Nassau, said docks on the western side of Great Inagua island had been destroyed and that the roof of a government building was partially ripped off. "As the storm passes over Eleuthera and Cat Island, they should get a pretty good beating," he said. "There are sections of Eleuthera we are concerned about." The Atlantis resort went into lockdown after dozens of tourists left Paradise Island before the airport closed, said George Markantonis, president of Kerzner International, which manages the resort. He said Atlantis was less than half full but all of its restaurants, casinos and other facilities were still operating. Sooner Halvorson, a 36-year-old hotel owner from Colorado who recently moved to the Bahamas, said she and her husband, Matt, expected to ride out the storm with their two young children, three cats, two dogs and a goat at their Cat Island resort. "We brought all of our animals inside," she said, though she added that a horse stayed outside. "She's a 40-year-old horse from the island. She's been through tons of hurricanes." On Great Exuma island, guest house operator Veronica Marshall supplied her only customer with a flashlight and some food before Sandy bore down. The storm-hardened Bahamian said she was confident she and her business would make it through intact. "I'm 73 years old and I've weathered many storms," she said. Hurricane Sandy was expected to churn through the central and north-west Bahamas late on Thursday and early Friday. It might cause tropical storm conditions along the south-east Florida coast, the Upper Keys and Florida Bay by Friday morning. With storm conditions projected to hit New Jersey with tropical storm-force winds on Tuesday, there is a 90% chance that most of the US east coast will get steady gale-force winds, flooding, heavy rain and possibly snow from Sunday, US forecaster Jim Cisco said.
In the wake of historic destruction wrought by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, residents of New York and other coastal cities were left wondering whether Sandy-scale storm floods are the new normal. Now, researchers from Princeton and Rutgers universities and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have developed a computer simulation that estimates that storm-related flooding on the New York City coastline similar in scale to those seen during Sandy are likely to become more common in coming decades. The worst-case scenario has the frequency increasing by 17 times by the year 2100, according to predictions published Oct. 10 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Beyond this particular prediction, the new model provides an important new tool that can predict, more accurately than previously possible, the kinds of storm floods that will threaten coastal cities over the next century. The new simulation promises to provide a picture of long-term coastal flood risk by accounting for both sea-level rise and varying storm activity due to climate change. Scientists call flooding associated with coastal storms "surge floods," referring the rise of coastal water due to storm surge (produced by a storm’s pressure and wind forces) and sea-level rise. Princeton and other researchers have analyzed storm data to create a computer simulation to estimate the chances of coastal flooding along the East Coast similar to that brought by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The worst-case scenario shows the chances of such flooding increasing 17 times by the year 2100. Here, researchers from Princeton and Notre Dame universities assess storm damage after Sandy. (Photo courtesy of Ning Lin, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering) "To effectively prepare for future hurricanes, we need to know what coastal cities will be facing in the coming decades, but past models have not accounted for all of the significant dynamic factors involved in predicting surge floods," said Ning Lin, the lead author of the paper and a Princeton assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering. "You need numbers to plan, and this analysis puts sea-level rise and storm surge climatology together on a quantitative basis." Hurricane Sandy was the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history, in large part because the high storm tide — the combined height of the normal ocean tide and the storm surge — flooded large swaths of New York City and the New Jersey coastline. As the storm moved inland, it pushed a large wall of water in front of it, causing the East River to overflow its banks and pour into Lower Manhattan, inundating streets, buildings and subway tunnels. The storm caused an estimated $71 billion in damage and resulted in 157 deaths in the United States. Government agencies such as the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and state emergency management and planning agencies are exploring how best to minimize the damage from future Sandy-like storms. For instance, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has plans to build an enormous berm and walled park around low-lying areas of Manhattan along the East River as a bulwark against storms. "Your mitigation measures are only as good as your predictions of the threat you’re trying to mitigate," said Lin. "Engineering-wise we've always considered sea level and climate as static, but now we need to account for the change over time. Our work is focused on putting predictions of flooding on a truly quantitative basis by incorporating factors that are predicted to change. If you don’t account for rising sea level and possible change in storm activity, you’re underestimating future flood risk." In their study, Lin and her colleagues used their model to estimate past and future Sandy-like flood events in New York City. They based their estimates on historic data and combined predictions of sea level and peak storm surge height generated by several climate models including those the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses. "Our model for the first time pulls together probabilistic estimates for sea-level rise and storm surge to produce long-term predictions of flood stages," Lin said. "These two variables, although largely uncertain, are critical in determining the extent of coastal flooding from future hurricanes." Using the model to look back in time, the researchers found that due to sea-level rise alone the frequency of storms producing Sandy-like surge floods increased threefold during the two centuries from 1800 to 2000. Looking forward, again based on just sea-level rise, they found that such surge floods will become 4.4 times more frequent between 2000 and 2100. Sea-level rise results primarily from the expanding volume of ocean water due to rising global temperatures and melting of the glaciers and ice sheets. "The grand answer is that things are going to get worse by 2100,” said Benjamin P. Horton, who is a professor of marine and coastal sciences in Rutgers' School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. "If nothing changes with hurricanes, sea-level rise alone will increase the frequency of Sandy-like events by 2100." When they also incorporated predicted changes in storm climatology, the model estimated that Sandy-like surge floods would become at least 3 times to as much as 17 times more common. “What this tells us is that large surge floods are likely to increase in frequency, but that there is a large amount of uncertainty about the extent of the increase,” Lin said. The researchers noted that every Sandy-sized storm surge doesn't necessarily equate to flooding like that seen during Sandy, which also happened to hit during a particularly high astronomical tide (the tide due to the gravitational pull of Earth’s moon). The summation of the storm surge and the astronomical tide is called the “storm tide," the total height of the floodwaters. A hurricane that produced the same size storm surge as Sandy, but that peaked during a low astronomical tide, might not cause the same catastrophic flooding. “The effect of astronomical tide will be accounted for in the future,” Lin said, “but the tide component doesn’t change with the climate and so the increasing trend of flood frequency will be similar.” There is still much debate about whether hurricanes are becoming more frequent and intense. "But even if storms occur at the same frequency and strength, our estimates suggest the frequency of surge floods will significantly increase based on rising sea level,” said Lin. “As we refine climate and hurricane dynamic models, we will have more accurate predictions that will allow planners to better design flood mitigation strategies.” Rick Luettich, a professor of marine sciences and environmental sciences and engineering at the University of North Carolina who was not involved in the research, said that the research represents another important step toward quantifying the risk of storm surge and associated flooding in the coastal New York and New Jersey areas, today and during the remainder of the 21st century. "This information is critical for enabling well-informed decisions about the future of this region," he said. "One wonders whether this area would have developed into the megacity it is today had its early years occurred under the storm surge conditions predicted for 2100." In addition to Lin and Horton, authors on the paper include Robert Kopp of Rutgers University and Jeffrey Donnelly of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Read More Lack of Hurricane Warnings May Help Homeowners By Andrew Freedman Published: November 2nd, 2012 , Last Updated: November 2nd, 2012 Silver linings post Hurricane Sandy have been hard to find. But the decision by the National Weather Service not to issue hurricane warnings north of North Carolina, and to instead declare Hurricane Sandy a “post-tropical cyclone” mere hours before landfall near Atlantic City on Oct. 29, may have significant ramifications for homeowners and insurance companies. In four hard-hit states — Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York — the storm classification may save homeowners from having to pay costly hurricane insurance deductibles. Coastal flooding in New Jersey viewed from a helicopter just after Hurricane Sandy struck the area. Credit: New Jersey National Guard/Scott Anema. The deductibles typically range from 1 to 5 percent of the covered value of a home. So, if a home is insured for $300,000, and there is a deductible of 5 percent, the homeowner would have to pay $15,000 before getting back any money from their insurance company. Governors and insurance regulators in the four states have stated that hurricane deductibles will not apply in this case, in large part because the storm was not officially a hurricane with sustained winds of 74 mph or greater at landfall, and it did not prompt the Weather Service to issue hurricane warnings. Hurricane Sandy is expected to be one of the top 10 costliest hurricanes on record in the U.S., with some total damage estimates rising to $50 billion. (Hurricane Katrina in 2005 ranks as the costliest hurricane to strike the U.S., costing more than $100 billion.) Therefore, for insurance companies, there is a lot at stake in the wake of this storm, including dealing with seemingly trivial differences in the title of storm warnings. Connecticut law, for example, requires a hurricane warning to be issued for the state in order for the deductible to kick in. “The state moved very swiftly to alert the industry that this storm — although devastating to so many — did not meet the criteria for a hurricane deductible under state law,” said Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in a press release. State insurance regulators vet homeowners’ insurance policies and play a role in determining hurricane deductibles. Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York’s superintendent of financial services, said hurricane deductibles were not triggered in his state because the storm did not have sustained winds of hurricane force (74 mph or greater) when it hit the state. Michael Barry of the Insurance Information Institute told Climate Central that Hurricane Sandy will likely force state insurance regulators and insurance companies to think about how to price the impacts of future high-impact, post-tropical storms like Sandy, even as meteorologists argue about the last one. NWS’ Naming Dilemma With Hurricane Sandy, the Weather Service faced a rare challenge — how do you warn people in a heavily populated area of a storm that would have all the impacts of a hurricane, yet was going to lack the structure of a true hurricane when it made landfall? The main difference between a hurricane and a “post-tropical cyclone” has to do with the energy source from which the storm is drawing. Hurricanes draw their power from warm ocean waters, whereas post-tropical cyclones are energized by sharp temperature differences between air masses. As Sandy moved up the East Coast, it gradually transitioned into a post-tropical storm as it interacted with a cold front, and that is what helped expand its wind field, and actually contributed to its much larger impacts than had it been a typical hurricane.

What the National Hurricane Center (NHC), working with other NWS offices, chose to do was controversial within the meteorological community, and now it is likely to reverberate throughout the insurance industry. The Hurricane Center chose not to issue any hurricane watches or warnings beyond North Carolina, even though many areas would see hurricane-force wind gusts. Instead, NHC allowed local NWS offices to issue an array of warnings ranging from high-wind warnings to coastal-flood warnings. Rick Knabb, the director of the NHC, told reporters that the decision was made in order to minimize confusion in the event that Sandy was reclassified as a post-tropical cyclone before making landfall, which would have required that all hurricane warnings be canceled, and other warnings to be issued instead. “By using non-tropical warnings in these areas from the start, we avoid or minimize the significant confusion that could occur if the warning suite changed from tropical to non-tropical in the middle of the event,” NHC said in a statement. The lack of hurricane warnings north of North Carolina was heavily criticized by TV meteorologists, who took to social media platforms to question the Weather Service’s decision. Harvey Leonard, a TV meteorologist at WCVB-TV in Boston tweeted on Oct. 28, “For storm surge, ground zero will be Long Island, NY . . . inexcusable that there is not an official hurricane warning there.” Jim Cantore of The Weather Channel tweeted on Oct. 27, “I completely disagree with NHC not putting up Hurricane warnings for the northeast." Later, Cantore said he wondered if New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s initial decision not to order evacuations of low-lying areas would have been different had hurricane warnings been issued. Bloomberg eventually ordered mandatory evacuations ahead of the storm.
World Flickr Posts Precisely Matched Hurricane Sandy's Landfall When Hurricane Sandy came ashore in October 2012, it made waves in the virtual world as well as the real one. Photographs posted to the picture-sharing website Flickr track Sandy's landfall on Oct. 30, 2012, precisely, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports. "Our results show that the greatest number of photos taken with Flickr titles, descriptions or tags including the words 'hurricane,' 'sandy' or 'hurricane sandy' were taken in exactly the hour which Hurricane Sandy made landfall," study researcher Tobias Preis, a professor of behavioral science and finance at the Warwick Business School in the U.K., wrote in an email to LiveScience. In light of such findings, Preis and his colleagues decided to find out whether Hurricane Sandy made a social media splash, too. The researchers searched Flickr for Sandy-related tags, which users assign as a way to categorize photographs. They found that the number of photographs taken tracked perfectly with the storm's landfall in New Jersey, as measured by atmospheric pressure, which decreases toward the center of a storm like Sandy. "As air pressure in New Jersey fell to its worst lows, the number of photos taken rose, and as air pressure in New Jersey rose again, the number of photos taken fell," Preis wrote. The photo-taking spike may have been caused by changes in the weather, in which case Flickr could be a good gauge of outside conditions if no other options were available during an event, the researchers reported. Alternatively, people could have been alerted to the storm's approach by media and gotten out the cameras in response. If the latter is the case, Flickr may be a reflection of moments of national attention. More work is needed to see if the Flickr phenomenon holds in other disaster situations, the researchers wrote.

President Obama and Mitt Romney are off the campaign trail as Hurricane Sandy wallops the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine President Obama told the nation Monday his administration is ready for Hurricane Sandy as he put politics aside and took charge of the federal response to the monster storm threatening New York and much of the East Coast. "I'm confident that we're ready," Obama said. But he also warned the American public that the post-storm clean up could "take a long time." "The public should anticipate that there are going to be a lot of power outages," Obama said. "Everybody is taking this very seriously." Obama addressed the nation after he abruptly canceled a planned campaign rally Monday in the key battleground state of Florida — and one scheduled for Tuesday in Wisconsin — to focus his complete attention Sandy. Advertisement TIM SHAFFER/REUTERS Philadelphia was a ghost town Monday. Asked about Sandy's possible effect on the next week's hard-fought election, Obama said he was more concerned about the storm's effect on the American people, on first responders, and the economy. "I am not worried at this point about the election," the President said. "The election will take care of itself next week." "Right now our number one priority is that we are saving lives," he said. Obama has already declared emergencies in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania — and dispatched federal relief workers to prepare for the worst. On Sunday, Obama vowed that the government will "respond big and respond fast" after the storm hits. He was expected to address the nation later Monday. Philadelphia was a ghost town Monday. (TIM SHAFFER/REUTERS) Mark Wilson/Getty Images Hurricane Sandy flooded Cape May, New Jersey. Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican rival, also suspended his campaign Monday. The GOP challenger had planned to campaign in key battleground states such as Ohio and Iowa to steer clear of the storm. Sandy was expected to make landfall later Tuesday in New Jersey and hit New York City with high winds and rain, but the weather witch was already lashing the barrier islands of North Carolina with high winds, all but cutting them off from the mainland. In Virginia, thousands were without power and officials warned that number could climb into the millions before Sandy is finished wreaking havoc. And in Washington, D.C., the city's subway system was shut down for the first time since 2003 and the Smithsonian Institution was closed to the public. In Delaware, hundreds fled to shelters as the storm pounded the coast and Dover Air Force Base flew some aircraft out of harm's way. And in Ocean City, Maryland, the iconic pier was badly damaged by pounding surf. On the far western side of the state, a blizzard warning was in effect as Sandy was expected to hook up with a cold front moving eastward and start dumping snow. Blizzard warnings were also extended to the mountainous parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. Further north in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love also shut down its subway and shuttered schools ahead of Sandy's arrival. Up in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine, utility crews were bracing for widespread power outages — and reinforcements were motoring down from Canada and up from Texas and the Midwest to help out if needed. Connecticut Light & Power has already reported that hundreds of customers along storm-lashed Long Island Sound were already without power. And in Rhode Island, 2,600 National Grid customers were without power. In Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin declared an emergency in a state that is still recovering from the disastrous flooding caused last year after Irene was downgraded to a tropical storm. School was canceled across Maine and the governor in neighboring New Hampshire declared a state of emergency and called up 100 National Guardmen to help local police with storm response.

(CNN) -- They've lost their homes, their businesses and many are still stranded, but residents in the battered Northeast are overcoming the aftereffects of Superstorm Sandy with a gritty resolve. "It's sort of like the transit strike a few years ago," said Elizabeth Gorman, 40, a Queens resident, who walked across the Queensboro Bridge on Wednesday. Gorman was part of a steady stream of commuters forced to walk or bike into Manhattan after Sandy roared ashore barely two days ago, wiping out roads, bridges and mass transit systems across the region. Commuters, homeowners and businesses struggled with the loss of power and waterlogged or burned homes. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a "transportation emergency" Wednesday night, saying New York City subways, buses and commuter rails would be free of charge Thursday and Friday as a way to encourage people to use mass transit. Gridlock on Wednesday was "dangerous," he said. But not all of the city's transit was operating. Fourteen of the city's 23 subway lines are opening Thursday, with buses helping to cover the unserved areas, Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Joe Lhota said. But there will be no subway service to lower Manhattan, which is still dealing with flooding and power outages, he said. And bus service, which resumed Thursday, was stopped below 23rd Street because the area is still dark and too dangerous, Lhota said. The three major New York-area airports will all be open Thursday, albeit with limited service, authorities said. John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty reopened Wednesday with limited service, and LaGuardia -- where floodwaters covered runways and taxiways -- will reopen Thursday. Many people across the region are still in need of basic supplies. President Barack Obama visited a shelter Wednesday in the hard-hit town of Brigantine, New Jersey, where he said he met a woman with an 8-month-old who has run out of diapers and formula. "Those are the kinds of basic supplies and help that we can provide," he said. Obama promised the federal government "will not quit" until communities are cleaned up.

"And I've instituted a 15-minute rule, essentially, on my team. You return everybody's phone calls in 15 minutes, whether it's the mayor's, the governor's, county officials. "If they need something, we figure out a way to say yes." New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie asked for patience as crews worked to turn the power back on for more than 2 million people still in the dark. He toured Brigantine with Obama, who said utilities from across the country have pledged to send crews to New Jersey as soon as possible. Sandy came ashore late Monday in southern New Jersey, wiping out houses, pushing sand four blocks inland in places and leaving people stranded. Seventy people were rescued Wednesday from the barrier island in Toms River, New Jersey -- people who ignored orders to evacuate, Police Chief Mike Mastronardy said. "Everyone that we've encountered during evacuations today wish they'd left prior to the storm," he said. Authorities are still working to extinguish 11 of 30 gas fires that broke out in the storm, he said. Flooding was still a problem in many areas. Over its entire path, the storm killed at least 124 people -- 67 in the Caribbean, 56 in the United States and one in Canada. The fire that broke out in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Breezy Point during the storm destroyed 110 homes, Assistant Fire Chief Joseph Pfeiffer said. Search and rescue teams were going through each home to check for victims. "The number of homes lost in Breezy Point by fire is just tragic," Cuomo said Wednesday. "That no one lost their life in Breezy Point is a miracle." Staten Island saw no such miracle. Half of the state's 28 deaths were on Staten Island, and two boys were missing. Borough President James Molinaro said the waters have mostly receded, but the damage is severe. In Seaside Heights, New Jersey, Mayor Bill Akers said his hard-hit town will tough it out. "We're going to just do the best we can and give the support," he said. "When it's tougher, we're the best community." On Wednesday, the storm sputtered over the Great Lakes region, where its strong winds are expected to trigger some lakeside flooding as well as additional snowfall in parts of West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. More than 5.3 million customers across the eastern United States were still in the dark Wednesday, down from the nearly 8 million who lost power shortly after the storm hit. Christie described the damage along the Jersey Shore as "unthinkable." Akers said crews are trying to get each and every person to shelters from his battered community, which he called he the storm's "ground zero." Speaking to CNN, Akers' voice cracked a bit as he described the enormity of the destruction and the resolve to rebuild. "I just want to try to keep the emotion out of it," he said. "For everybody, it's -- this is a loss for everybody ... not just Seaside Heights. "If there's any good news," he added, "the water (has) receded, the roadways are accessible. But we still have downed power lines. We are not letting anybody in at that particular time." Some 10,000 Army and Air National Guard forces were on duty in the 13 states affected by the storm. The Army Corps of Engineers was also helping, deploying water pumps and generators to New York and New Jersey, the U.S. Defense Department said. They're also going to send 80 truckloads of water to West Virginia, where snow generated by the storm has left some areas inaccessible. Other military branches have also been deployed to help in the storm's aftermath. The U.S. Coast Guard sent airboats normally used for ice rescues in the Great Lakes, and the U.S. Navy was moving three landing ships to the affected coastlines. Some 730,000 New Yorkers were still in the dark Wednesday night, with utility Con Edison estimating another three days before it can restore power to Manhattan and Brooklyn, and as many as 10 days for other boroughs and the suburb of Westchester. Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan evacuated its 700 patients because the pumps that supply oil to the generators are in the basement under 8 feet of water, a source familiar with the evacuation plan said. New York University Langone Medical Center had to evacuate more than 200 patients because of a generator problem a day earlier. The Lincoln Tunnel was open, but the Holland Tunnel, the other tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, was still full of water. The Port Authority said it can't start pumping out the water until power is restored. Still, there were hints amid the aftermath Wednesday that New York City was slowly getting back to normal. The New York Stock Exchange reopened after a two-day closure, Broadway's trade association said all shows would be curtains up on Thursday and Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday's New York Marathon would go on as scheduled. "For cooped-up New Yorkers and out-of-town visitors who are staying in hotels and can't get home, now is a great time to see a show!" said Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of The Broadway League. That said, Thursday's game between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn was postponed. And while traffic gridlock returned, for some it was a welcome sign that New Yorkers were at least trying to move forward. A mother learns that her newborn is part of a hospital evacuation.

Thousands of Con Edison customers lose power due to Hurricane Sandy through New York City and Westchester County As power went out throughout New York City, a woman stood on a piece of wood with a flash light to get a better view in Dumbo, Brooklyn as the tide rose along the East River on Monday night. (John Taggart/for New York Daily News) (John Taggart for New York Daily News) More than 156,000 Con Edison customers in New York City and Westchester County had lost power Monday evening, and the utility preemptively shut down the grid for roughly 6,500 customers in lower Manhattan as Tropical Storm Sandy increased in intensity. Electricity was cut to two areas, the first within the confines of Frankfort Street to the north; William Street to the west; Wall Street to the south; and the East River. The second area is bounded by Broadway to the west; Wall Street to the north; and the southern tip of Manhattan, according to Con Edison. Jefferson Siegel for New York Da ConEd emergency vehicles mobilize in the north end of Union Square in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy on Sunday, October 28, 2012. The utility opted to pull the plug because the "storm surge threatened to flood the underground electrical delivery system," according to a statement. ConEd also cut steam service to 140 customers in Manhattan. If steam pipes become inundated in cold water, they can become potentially explosive. ConEd emergency vehicles mobilize in the north end of Union Square in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy on Sunday, October 28, 2012. (Jefferson Siegel for New York Da) Swaths of Manhattan south of 36th St. could be the next to lose power, said ConEd spokesman Alfonso Quiroz. The company has provided the same message to certain customers in flood-prone areas of Brooklyn, Queens and The Bronx. "If the water level comes to a certain point we will have to preemptively power some equipment down," Quiroz said. "It makes it easier and faster for us to make restorations. If we don't, it will burn out." The company had already made a barrage of robo calls beginning around 1 p.m. warning customers from Battery Park to 36th St. of a possible power down. Customers closest to the Hudson and East Rivers were the most vulnerable, Quiroz said. Quiroz said "storm riders" working for Con Edison were monitoring water levels and that when they reached a certain threshold the order would be passed along to cut power.

Read More Officials Warn of Hurricane Sandy’s Rare Damage Potential By Andrew Freedman Published: October 26th, 2012 , Last Updated: October 26th, 2012 Federal weather forecasters and emergency management officials are warning residents along the East Coast to prepare for major impacts from Hurricane Sandy as it transitions into a larger, more powerful hybrid storm that will take an extremely unusual path. The track and forecasted size of the storm could make it rival or exceed the impacts from some of the worst coastal storms on record in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, such as 1991’s Perfect Storm and the Ash Wednesday storm in 1962, which is regarded as the worst coastal flooding event on record along the Jersey shore. An atmospheric "blocking pattern" will push Sandy north, and then northwestward, into the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: Remik Ziemlinski, Climate Central. The storm is expected to parallel the Carolinas during the day on Saturday, and it may intensify somewhat after possibly weakening to a tropical storm, said National Hurricane Center branch chief James Franklin during a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon. Then Hurricane Sandy, which may be referred to by that time as “Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy” as it draws more and more energy from the jet stream rather than only the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, should be punted northwestward, making landfall on Monday night or Tuesday anywhere from coastal Delaware to Southern New England. The storm system — dubbed "Frankenstorm" by the the media — is expected to have a much larger windfield and swath of heavy rainfall, as well as area of storm surge risk, than a typical hurricane, said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in College Park, Md. Uccellini has long studied powerful Northeastern storms. “It is really going to be a massive storm system,” Uccellini said. He said that while he wouldn’t make comparisons to other storms until this one is over, there are indications that this one could be stronger than the Perfect Storm. In addition, unlike The Perfect Storm, this one may wrap Arctic air into it, dumping accumulating snow in West Virginia and Southeast Ohio on Monday and into Tuesday. FEMA director Craig Fugate said he briefed President Obama about the storm threat on Friday morning, and that the agency is already moving resources into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as a precaution. He said the wide scope of this storm — at its height it may encompass the eastern third of the country, with warnings up from Virginia to Maine and westward to Ohio — is a challenging factor for emergency managers. “This won’t be a point specific [event] as much as area specific,” Fugate said, noting that the landfall location shouldn’t be a major focus for the public. Fugate urged people in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast to take actions this weekend to prepare for Sandy, since the storm is still three to four days away. “This storm is still some ways off in many parts of the country; you have the weekend to get ready. But that window will close,” he said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city government will consider whether to shut down all or part of the transit system ahead of the storm, as it did in what was then an unprecedented step prior to Irene. The storm surge from Irene came within a few inches of flooding the subway tunnels of lower Manhattan, despite the actions taken by transit officials, and based on some computer model scenarios, this storm could bring a far larger storm surge to the city. Uccellini said that several factors are converging to make Sandy a particularly menacing storm in terms of its storm surge potential. “We’re at a lunar tide, and with a slow moving system like this you increase the potential for inundation just for that alone,” he said. Uccellini also noted that the storm will be moving slowly from east to west as it approaches the coastline, an angle that is ideal for maximizing the surge potential. Bloomberg said about 395,000 people live in the zone that would be evacuated first, if evacuations are indeed ordered. Several states have already declared states of emergency in advance of Sandy, including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, coastal North Carolina, and Virginia. If the storm should cause long-lasting and widespread power outages, it could have an influence come Election Day on Nov. 6.

3 Years After Hurricane Sandy, Is New York Prepared for the Next Great Storm? New York is spending $20 billion to protect its shores from sea-level rise—but that may not be enough.

In the days after Superstorm Sandy hit New York City in 2012, the parking lot at Beach 95th Street in the Rockaways was a commons for the dispossessed. A large crowd milled about the New York Police Department light tower, where people could charge their cell phones and preserve their link to the outside world. An even larger group stood in line waiting for trucks carrying relief supplies to pull into the lot; one end of the lot was piled with huge timbers ripped from the boardwalk and thrown into the street by a raging sea. All across the Rockaways—a narrow peninsula on the city’s far southeastern edge that juts precariously into the Atlantic Ocean—the air hummed with generators, the streets were caked with sand, and cars were scattered across parking lots like toys. In the late-autumn gloom, people spoke ominously of what it felt like when the sun went down on a peninsula without lights. Nearly three years later, on a Thursday in August with the Atlantic hurricane season ramping up, the same parking lot was bathed in sunshine as beachgoers threw towels over their shoulders, grabbed their coolers, and headed for the sound of crashing waves. On their way, they passed a table set up by the city’s Office of Emergency Management offering flood maps, hurricane-survival tips, and a coloring book in which a dinosaur, an octopus, and an anthropomorphized boom-box talk about disaster preparedness. Few bathers seemed interested in the brochures as beach reading. After all, beyond the dunes, the ocean looked anything but menacing—a gleaming stretch of blue that bore tanker ships across the horizon and bounced children on gentle waves at its edge. Veteran surfers surfed; kiters kited from the sand; and bikers biked on the boardwalk, past funky beachside restaurants selling beer and barbecue sandwiches. It was the kind of scene that has made the Rockaways a much more popular place to visit—and even move to—after Sandy than it ever was before. There are signs of a new awareness to risk: 50 yards from the surfers, an earth-moving machine tore up the old wooden boardwalk so that it could be replaced with a sturdier concrete version that doubles as a storm-surge barrier—part of a generous package of resiliency infrastructure that the city has been steadily installing. But there is also new investment right along the water, with 900 units expected at a snazzy development called Arverne by the Sea and plans for more housing at an 80-acre site called Arverne East. Other smaller but significant projects are also under way. Sandy was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters ever to hit the United States, killing 71 people and causing $50 billion in damage. Coastal communities in three states felt the brunt of the storm, but New York City suffered acutely, with 43 deaths and at least $19 billion in economic impacts. And, as can easily be seen in the Rockaways, the city is where the tensions and trade-offs of responding to Sandy—and also preparing for the climate change that is likely to make such devastating storms more common—are most stark. New York City knows it faces a climate-change crisis. Scientists predict that by 2100, seas along the city’s coastline could be six feet higher than today, putting more than 800,000 people at risk from major storms that will likely become more frequent. But in the face of rising seas, New York is showing no interest in pulling back from the water’s edge; if anything, the city’s waterfront will be home to an even larger population the next time a hurricane hits. The city is also challenging new Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps that show a vastly heightened risk for large parts of coastal New York, because, left unchallenged, the maps would trigger higher insurance rates that would devastate what’s left of the city’s working-class waterfront. A few—very few—voices from the worlds of planning and climate science are calling for a drastically different approach, something they call “managed retreat.” That means creating a plan now for pulling back from the water when the time comes, including where and how to move people, and dealing with the inevitable tensions over equity: who gets to stay and who has to go. “I think we’re deluding ourselves,” says Ron Shiffman, a veteran city planner. “There’s only so far you can kick the can down the road. We know sea-level rise will be six feet by the end of the century. That’s an enormous amount; we need to be able to plan for it. If we make a mistake,” he adds, planners should err on the side of “what’s prudent [rather] than on what’s dangerous.” There’s no denying that “managed retreat” is a radical idea. Few politicians have the courage or the capital to float the idea, let alone execute it. And while not unprecedented as a concept—small coastal tribes in Alaska, Washington State and Louisiana have been forced to begin doing it—New York City would present extraordinary challenges of scale. The city’s large and growing population makes relocation hard to contemplate, and the severe affordability crisis that’s already making it difficult for working-class people to survive in the five boroughs renders such shifts downright scary. It’s much nicer to think, as urban dwellers have done in the past, that New York will find a way to outsmart nature. In the face of rising seas, New York is showing no interest in pulling back from the water’s edge. Indeed, the city is making a bet that its nearly $20 billion investment in new protective measures will buy it time to figure out exactly what a warmer planet has in store and come up with ways to deal with that new reality. It’s a common wager for cities and states located on the coasts. The question is whether our confidence in our ability to have it all—waterfront properties and safe people, resilient neighborhoods and economic diversity—is properly calibrated to the enormous risks posed by climate change. New York City, you see, is wrestling with a problem that involves more than the weather. With 164 million people living on the coastal United States, and with their numbers growing by 1 million each year, climate change is a challenge not just to engineers and zoning officials, but to the very capacity of democratic governments to plan for the long term—a time when everyone reading this article is dead and the world is a much different place. * * * In some ways, Sandy was a very abnormal event to alert people to the new normal. It wasn’t even a hurricane by the time it made landfall in New Jersey, but it was still an enormous storm—three times the size of Hurricane Katrina—that struck not just at high tide, but at an unusually high one. The chances of a storm exactly like Sandy ever happening again are low, even with climate change; scientists are careful to note that it’s impossible to link any individual storm to the warming earth. It’s also hard to say whether climate change will translate into a higher number of tropical storms, or fewer but more intense ones. What is clear is that any storm—including the winter nor’easters that have always posed a more common threat than hurricanes to New York City—has the potential to do much more damage when it travels over higher water. And there is almost no doubt that the seas are going to rise dramatically around the city. Estimates of the extent of that rise have only grown more alarming over time. When the pioneering New York City Panel on Climate Change reviewed the evidence in 2009, it predicted a rise of seven to 12 inches by the 2050s, and 12 to 23 inches by the 2080s. An update released earlier this year anticipates a rise of 11 to 21 inches by the 2050s, and 18 to 39 inches by the 2080s. By 2100, the mid-range estimate is for a sea-level rise of 22 to 50 inches, but it could be as high as six feet. The predictions translate into a “10- to 15-fold increase in frequency of the current 100-year coastal flood by 2080.” New York City will go from having 400,000 people in its floodplain today to twice that amount—some 800,000 people, over 72 square miles of the city—living within the flood zone. The city has projected that by 2050, a Sandy-scale storm would cause not $19 billion in economic impacts, but $90 billion in today’s dollars. Eight months after Sandy, in June 2013, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg traveled to the Brooklyn waterfront to unveil the Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resil­iency (SIRR), his vision for how the city would manage life on the edge of a rising ocean. Impressive as always when discussing a topic where his command of technical detail was matched by real passion, Bloomberg declared: “We cannot and will not abandon our waterfront. It’s one of our greatest assets. We must protect it, not retreat from it.” There was a “futility” to retreat, the mayor said: In addition to the 400,000 people living within the floodplain, there were businesses employing 270,000 workers. “They are not going anywhere, and we cannot and will not abandon them.” By 2100, the mid-range estimate is for a sea-level rise of 22 to 50 inches, but it could be as high as six feet. This was no surprise: As mayor, Bloomberg oversaw a huge transformation of the waterfront—some of it for the enjoyment of the public, but a great deal for the benefit of luxury-condo owners. He wasn’t about to let his legacy be erased. Indeed, the SIRR laid out a massive building plan to protect the city from storm surges. Its $3.7 billion first phase alone includes beach nourishment, drainage systems, levees, new dunes, protective groins to reduce wave velocity, flood walls, surge barriers, wetlands restoration, revetments, bulkheads, and breakwaters. Vehemently critical of Bloomberg’s legacy, current Mayor Bill de Blasio hasn’t deviated much from his predecessor’s policies on climate change. He’s strengthened the city’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. He’s carrying out the SIRR: replacing the Rockaways boardwalk, repairing bulkheads elsewhere on the peninsula, replenishing beaches in Staten Island, and launching a dizzying array of planning studies. And he has steadfastly resisted any discussion of retreat from the areas most at risk. “When you look at a really dense city like New York—we have 115,000 or so people living on the Rockaways—retreat has huge implications,” says Daniel Zarrilli, the current head of the city’s Office of Resiliency and Recovery. “There are ways to flexibly adapt and invest to reduce those risks to manageable levels, given the risks we see for the foreseeable future.” In fact, he says, the de Blasio administration may even permit denser residential construction in some areas to lure new development, because new buildings constructed to code contain better protections against flooding. * * * The city’s coastal-protection plan doesn’t purport to give New Yorkers total safety from coastal flooding; it acknowledges that a storm surge can sometimes overcome even the elaborate defenses that the city is building. Zarrilli reminds audiences that there is “no silver bullet” against something as large and unpredictable as the Atlantic Ocean. Bloomberg’s 2007 PlaNYC—the document laying out the climate-induced threats and potential solutions—was even less sanguine. “We could even consider a storm surge barrier across the Narrows,” the report said, referring to the entrance to New York Harbor between Brooklyn’s south shore and Staten Island’s northeast coast, “but the massive changes that scientists predict under extreme scenarios would still place much of the city underwater—and beyond the reach of any protective measures.” That’s the problem with a wall, says Klaus Jacob, a Columbia University scholar who sits on the city’s climate-science panel: However high it’s built, someday a wave will be big enough to top it—or to flow up rivers and streams and flood the city from behind. “If you have a fixed height, you feel safe for the next decades—but then what?” Jacob says. “Because you have [only] postponed your problem. You have actually accumulated risk behind the barriers while the barriers lose their defensive capacity.” Jacob argues that the city should begin planning for “strategic resettlement, strategic relocation, strategic retreat—whatever you want to call it.” Given the likelihood that a sea-level rise could make some neighborhoods (including parts of Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens) unlivable within the next century, he believes the city ought to start thinking about how to get people out of there in a way that is fair and orderly, as well as how to avoid putting new residents in the path of future harm. After all, New York City doesn’t face the life-or-death situation confronted by New Orleans, with 70 percent of its population living in a floodplain, or Fort Lauderdale, where half of the city’s residents are at risk. While the Big Apple has a long coastline, it also has a large inland area, much of which rises well above sea level. That means there are places to put people who can’t live near the water anymore. Sell the development rights to build higher in those areas, Jacob says, “and use the money to buy people out.” Outside the city, some experts have embraced managed retreat as one of many options governments should employ. An Urban Land Institute task force recommended that local governments identify unplanned areas “to relocate populations and businesses in a manner that allow[s] for social continuity over time with low levels of market disruption.” The Army Corps of Engineers concluded that “improved land use, wise use of floodplains, responsible evacuation planning, and strategic retreat are important and cost-effective actions,” although it noted that retreat would be hard to accomplish in the short term. It’s rare for society to know that a problem is coming so far in advance, yet so early that we don’t know exactly what it will look like. Some governments are pulling it off, albeit on a small scale. New Jersey’s Blue Acres program has bought out more than 350 properties in flood-prone communities. New York State has a similar program: It acquires parcels from homeowners who want out and sells them to others who promise to build new properties that are up to code. It also offers buyouts in areas where the risks are obvious and the community is overwhelmingly supportive. In these cases, the state purchases the land, demolishes the houses, and lets nature its course. The poster child for this effort is Oakwood Beach, a neighborhood built amid marshland on the east coast of Staten Island. During Sandy, the area was a showcase for nature’s power: houses lifted off their foundations or stripped of their roofs, appliances blown across fields of reeds. “There really shouldn’t have been development in this area in the first place,” says Lisa Bova Hiatt, the executive director of the state program called NY Rising. But alongside the buyout area are houses that have been rebuilt and will remain—a reminder that while Sandy presented a difficult policy question about whether and how to rebuild, it also created a human catastrophe that the city had to address. “Some of the tasks are at cross-purposes with one another,” says Joan Byron, director of policy at the Pratt Center for Community Development. “The moral obligation is to help people go back to where they were. We’re trying to do that and also adapt to the fact that the status quo isn’t what we thought it was.” But at some point the city has to reconcile these two threads: the desire to help victims and the need to plan wisely. * * * Seth Pinsky, an attorney who led the city’s Economic Development Corporation during the Bloomberg years, headed up the task force that produced the SIRR. The most important thing to understand about the coastal-protection plan, Pinsky says, is that it wasn’t aiming for the year 2100. “We deliberately chose a time frame that was sufficiently far out that many of the impacts of climate change that were relatively predictable were likely to have been felt by the city,” he says, “but wasn’t so far out that…we would end up being frozen by the magnitude of the challenge we had to overcome.” Part of the city’s thinking in preparing for climate change until only the year 2050 concerns probability. “The error bands get really wide as you go out beyond 2050,” Zarrilli says, and he’s right. There’s a four-inch swing in the midrange estimate of sea-level rise for New York in the 2020s. That becomes 10 inches by the 2050s; by 2100, the midrange spread is more than two feet. And the distance between the low and high estimates for 2100 is five feet. This is one of the quirks of climate-change science: It’s rare to know that a very serious problem is coming so far in advance, and yet so early that we don’t know exactly what it will look like. Still, even if we knew exactly what was going to happen in 2080 or 2100, it would be impossible to actually prepare for it, Pinsky says. Trying to do so would bust the budget and miss the chance that some new innovation—or, under the worst-case scenario, an even more pressing threat—will come along and change the game. Pinsky describes the city’s approach this way: “Let’s look for a way to buy ourselves time, and then our successors will address the next increment.” The city calls this a “flexible-adaptation pathway.” “We’re going to do the things that we know we need to do now, sort of the ‘no regrets’ actions, and then continue to make investments,” Zarrilli says. It sounds like a sensible approach. The problem, according to Jacob, is that it’s hard to say what counts as a “no regrets” action if you don’t know where you’re headed. “You have to have a long-term vision,” he explains. “That doesn’t mean you have to design for 100 years from now, but you have to have that vision.” Jacob knows it’s asking a lot for a government to look that far into the future. But if it’s difficult to contemplate finding an alternative place to house the current number of waterfront residents, it won’t get any easier if that population continues to increase in the meantime. “Planning for 2500 would be idiotic,” he says. “But [so is] planning for 2050 what we know will not survive 2100.” * * * New York City’s planning department is conducting a series of neighborhood studies of narrowly defined, low-lying coastal areas like the Bronx’s Harding Park, Manhattan’s West Chelsea, Brooklyn’s Canarsie and Gerritsen Beach, Staten Island’s East Shore, Queens’s Howard Beach, and more. It seems possible that some of the plans that emerge might open the door for managed retreat. For now, those at the most risk from rising seas are divided on whether to contemplate a day when the place they call home no longer exists. Lawanda Gainey lives in Carleton Manor, one of the public-housing complexes in the Rockaways, where she’s been for 26 years. “Old residents know nothing but the Rockaways…. They do not want to go.” But people in her generation or younger feel less attached. “I think if we had a chance to leave, then we would—no problem.” She feels safer now thanks to the city’s resiliency work, she says, but even so: “Who’s to say that [the next time] won’t be 10 times worse than it was the last time? Who knows?” A short ride away, in the neighborhood of Broad Channel in the middle of Jamaica Bay, Dan Mundy rattles off all the projects under way to protect his neighborhood: wave attenuators, mini-wetlands, the raising of whole streets. Mundy, a New York City fire chief, has been an environmentalist and advocate for the bay for more than a decade. He and other residents were the ones who figured out years back that plants in the bay were dying because of nitrogen from a city sewage plant. They outsmarted the scientists who had been certain that something else was to blame. The experience has made Mundy—no climate-change denier—skeptical of the experts’ projections. “I have seen theory after theory fall by the wayside,” he says. “Some predicted that by 2015, we’d see two feet of sea-level rise.” Mundy lives in his grandmother’s house in Broad Channel: Occupied since before 1938, the house took on water for the first time during Sandy. If he knew for sure that the place would someday be unlivable, Mundy says, he would likely stick around and live out his life in a place he loves. But “I certainly would have a different position for my kids.” The fact is that climate change will deliver a slew of new risks and problems, storm surges being just one. Few people will escape blackouts, food shortages, and the other greenhouse-effect nightmares that await no matter how far they live from the beach. What’s more, cities often depend on herculean efforts to counter the influence of nature. Chicago lifted itself two feet to escape the grime of lakefront life, and it reversed the course of its river so that it didn’t drink its own sewage. The Greater Los Angeles Area barely had water for 100,000 people; engineering has allowed it to house more than 18 million. Much of Boston is landfill, and New York flooded whole towns to make reservoirs for its millions. “We’ve transformed environments in ways people probably never would have imagined,” says William Solecki, a social scientist who co-chairs the city’s climate-science panel. Maybe New York will figure out a way to live with dramatically higher water levels, too. Or maybe not. The essence of climate change is that it’s unlike any threat human society has encountered before. In the face of such danger, overconfidence in our problem-solving capacity could magnify the risk. “Is it possible that parts of the Rockaways won’t exist in 2100? Absolutely,” says City Councilman Donovan Richards. “These are all things the city has to grapple with. So yes, I think it’s very clear that if we don’t get serious, if the world doesn’t get serious, we will see—in Queens, on Staten Island, in Brooklyn—­communities wiped off the map. I think it’s very clear that we are in imminent danger.”
The good, the bad, and the ugly … learning from Hurricane Sandy There’s lots of very bad and ugly. Sandy will likely become one of our costliest natural disasters. But the science got the storm right. Looking back at the entire track of Superstorm/Frankenstorm/Non-Tropical Cyclone/Extratropical Cyclone Sandy (yes, the storm has had a bunch of names!), it is really amazing to see how it formed and how the science got this storm right. It also gave me a horrible feeling about what could come out of this storm, as I knew so many deadly scenarios were in play. I have decided to highlight the good, the bad, and ugly parts about Hurricane Sandy. While most of this was simply ugly, there were a few good things that came out of this forecast. Let’s take a look back at Hurricane Sandy and see what went right and what went wrong. The Good: One word: Science The forecast for Sandy was fantastic, and could be considered as one of the finest moments in meteorology. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, also known as ECMWF or the European model, nailed down the track of Sandy a week before the storm pushed into southern New Jersey. The Europeans have more money invested into their weather model, and it uses 4D data assimilation unlike our American model, the Global Forecast System (GFS). Seven days before the event, the GFS model insisted that Sandy would push out to sea and possibly affect Bermuda. However, run after run of consistent forecasts, the European model kept its solution of a New England storm affecting millions of people. With such a huge concern about Sandy, NOAA decided that the local national weather services should launch special radiosondes (weather balloons) every six hours to get a better measure of what was happening within our atmosphere. These measurements about barometric pressure, temperature, wind speeds with height, and so much more was able to help the models create better runs so meteorologists would have a better idea of the track of the storm. If one feature pushed out or formed differently, it could easily change the track of Sandy. Using weather satellites such as GOES-13, which monitors the Eastern Seaboard and Atlantic ocean, can also help us not only get visible images of Earth from outer space, but it also grabs a lot of data and information that we also use in our weather models. If you can recall, GOES-13 experienced a lot of noise and had to be replaced by a temporary satellite until it was fixed a few months ago. The track for Sandy was great. The weather models and the NHC has a great forecast for the track of Hurricane Sandy. Image Credit: NOAA I wrote a post about how we may begin to see a rapid decline in U.S. satellites in the near future. According to a report from the National Research Council in early 2012, U.S. satellites in orbit are expected to decline from 23 in 2012 to only six in the year of 2020. Long-running missions to build and launch satellites are undergoing delays, missions are being cut as budgets are cut, and there have been some inevitable launch failures, plus changes in mission design and scope. If we do not improve these problems, then all of the progress we have made in the study of atmospheric sciences will be for nothing. Now, do you see how important it is to fund and receive full support for NOAA/NASA? If we never had satellites or weather models, then what happened on Monday evening, October 29, 2012 could have been another repeat of the 1938 Long Island hurricane that swept New York by surprise and killed hundreds of people. Fortunately, science prevailed and gave us plenty of time to warn the general public about the danger of Hurricane Sandy. The Bad: -Confusion I will state this first: I know there are plenty of people that took this storm seriously. If people were told to evacuate their homes, then many people did. However, there was confusion regarding the storm and its impact. For instance, do you remember Hurricane Irene from last year? Although the storm caused significant flooding and damage across New England, it was no where near the sense of dangerous as originally hyped. For some people, Irene was not a big deal. This “false” sense of being safe can really get people in trouble, and I find that to be a huge issue. You will find a few meteorologists who “hype” storms every now and then simply for ratings. When it comes to listening to people for weather information, it call comes down to who you trust and listen to. When meteorologists and local NWS decide to use strong wording in their forecasts and discussions to give the public a sense of urgency and that danger is near, you should always listen. When I wrote up a post about Sandy, I decided to title it “Hurricane Sandy is dangerous” to give everyone a sense that this storm means business. One huge area of concern I had was the process of not issuing hurricane watches or warnings along the New Jersey and New York coasts. The original idea from the National Hurricane Center was that this storm would become extratropical and thus not be a hurricane as it pushed inland. I understand the science of how it works regarding the transition of a warm core low becoming a cold core. However, the general public does not understand. Instead of issuing hurricane warnings, the NHC gave the local NWS offices to issue their own warnings. Some of the warnings such as “High wind warnings” were not only issued along the coasts where Sandy was suppose to make landfall, but these warnings were also issued as far south as North Georgia. My issue: Does the general public understand the definition of a high wind warning? I will admit, I had to double check the definition myself to understand what it truly means. High Wind Warning definition: A warning for sustained surface winds greater than 40 mph/64 kph lasting more than an hour or winds over 58 mph/93 kph over land that are either predicted or occurring for an unspecified period of time. For some people, this definition simply tells them that it will be very windy outside. However, does it really strike concern for most people? Personally, I believe the National Hurricane Center should have issued hurricane warnings. Many meteorologists via social media questioned their actions, and I am sure this will still be a topic that will be mentioned in future discussions about the warning process of Hurricane Sandy. This topic got so out of hand, the National Hurricane Center actually released a PDF online explaining their actions of not issuing hurricane warnings. -Social Media If you follow social media, you probably had information overload regarding Hurricane Sandy. At one point, there were confirmations that the New York Stock Exchange was flooding. Twenty minutes later, we had a new confirmation that this was not the case. In fact, the biggest thing that bothers me is when people post fake images. Everytime a major storm hits part of the United States, people tend to grab the same images over and over and claim it was from that particular event. I saw it during Hurricane Katrina, and I also saw it during the April 14-15, 2012 tornado outbreak across the Central Plains. Here’s my favorite example of the fake picture that circulated online: Fake image that circulated through social media claiming Hurricane Sandy was producing a supercell over New York City. Really? Image Credit: Who cares I will admit though, the image below is a little more believable. No? In attack of the spread of fake images online, someone decided to add a little humor to the situation. Either way, putting out fake images adds confusion for broadcast meteorologists/journalists who are trying to showcase what is actually happening during an event. If you are out there and think it is funny to photoshop old storms and claim it was something else, it isn’t. I cannot tell you how many times I have seen fake hail images, supercell structures that occurred a decade ago, and more. It is important to know who you follow when it comes to getting information. Is the source reliable? If so, you should still double check the picture. Sometimes, the photos are so good, that even reliable sources get fooled. I will admit, it has happened to me. As of now, at least 81 people in the U.S. have died from Sandy. Many of the deaths occurred from trees falling on cars and buildings. Sandy is also responsible for 67 deaths in the Caribbean, and two deaths in Canada. Overall, at least 150 people have passed away from this brutal storm. The damage has been extensive and beyond comprehensible, especially along the Jersey shore. There is no doubt Sandy reshaped the coastline as storm surge brought piles of sand well inland and destroyed homes and bridges along the coast. Many houses were simply pushed off its foundation and shifted to a different location. Cars were buried in water, and the subway stations flooded. There is no doubt in my mind that Hurricane Sandy will rank as one of the top three costliest weather disasters in United States history. Prayers go out to all of the victims that are fighting through this horrible tragedy. Bottom line: The forecasts for Sandy were excellent, and the ECMWF weather model saw this storm developing and pushing into the Mid-Atlantic/New England about eight days before actual landfall. I believe there could have been confusion regarding the lack of hurricane watches and warnings that were not issued for portions New Jersey and New York. As the storm hit, social media was excellent on getting real time information as it came in. However, there were a lot of fake images that were being shared around. I wish this never happened, but it tends to be the case whenever a significant weather event occurs. Finally, the ugly part of Sandy is the death and destruction that has occurred not only in the United States, but also in the Caribbean. The death count has surpassed over 150 deaths, which is one too many. Prayers go out to everyone affected by Hurricane Sandy.

Read More Senator Urges NOAA Not To Change Sandy Classification By Andrew Freedman Published: November 13th, 2012 , Last Updated: November 13th, 2012 When Hurricane Sandy came ashore near Atlantic City on the evening of October 29, the storm was no longer classified as a hurricane, according to the National Weather Service. Instead, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami determined that the storm had transitioned into a hybrid storm known as a “Post-Tropical Storm” shortly before landfall. That change was made because the storm exhibited characteristics similar to the Nor’easters that frequently lash the Northeast coast during the fall and winter — such as a broad expanse of wind and precipitation with the strongest rains and winds far-removed from the center of the storm. In a purely tropical storm system, the strongest winds and rain are located in a small core close to the storm center. Storm waves and surge cut across the barrier island at Mantoloking, NJ, eroding a wide beach, destroying houses and roads, and depositing sand onto the island and into the back-bay. The yellow arrow in each image points to the same feature.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: USGS. As Climate Central reported on Nov. 2, the storm status change has major implications for property owners who are filing insurance claims for storm damage, since most hurricane insurance policies have deductibles that would have been triggered if the storm still had been a named hurricane at the time of landfall, and if hurricane warnings were in effect. New York Senator Chuck Schumer (D) is now seeking to ensure that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) does not retroactively label the storm a hurricane during the course of a storm review, since doing so would raise deductibles for millions of home and business owners. According to The Hill, Schumer sent a letter to NOAA requesting that the storm be labeled a tropical storm or some other classification, rather than a hurricane. The letter also went to insurance companies. “Today, we’ve sent a letter to NOAA, the weather agency, as well as to the insurance companies that we’re looking over their shoulder. We want NOAA to keep this classified as a tropical storm and to save homeowners in New York and Long Island thousands of dollars, and we don’t want the insurance companies to play any games,” Schumer said in a radio interview. The deductibles typically range from 1-to-5 percent of the covered value of a home. So, if a home is insured for $300,000, and there is a deductible of 5 percent, the homeowner would have to pay $15,000 before getting back any money from their insurance company. In the past, the Weather Service has made changes to the intensity rating of hurricanes years after the storms made landfall, as was the case with Hurricane Andrew. That storm struck South Florida in 1992 as a Category 4 hurricane, but it was upgraded to Category 5 intensity a decade later after meteorologists reviewed storm data. However, it would be extremely unusual, if not unprecedented, for a storm like Sandy to be switched from a post-tropical storm to a hurricane, given that such classifications involve fundamental storm structure and not just the strength of the winds. Satellite loop from the University of Wisconsin, showing Hurricane Sandy becoming post-tropical as it made landfall in New Jersey. Hurricane Sandy is expected to be one of the top 10 costliest hurricanes on record in the U.S., with some total damage estimates rising to $50 billion to $100 billion. (Hurricane Katrina in 2005 ranks as the costliest hurricane to strike the U.S., costing more than $100 billion.) Therefore, for insurance companies, there is a lot at stake in the wake of this storm, including dealing with seemingly trivial differences in the title of storm warnings. On Monday, the Weather Service announced that it appointed a review team to examine the agency’s performance in forecasting Hurricane Sandy and its impacts. Such “service assessments” are typically done after a major storm event, particularly a deadly event, but in a rare move, the agency turned to an outside expert. Leading that review will be Mike Smith of AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting firm and a frequent critic of the agency, to be a co-leader along with Nezette Rydell, the meteorologist-in-charge of the National Weather Service forecast office in Denver. On his blog, Smith has written that the Weather Service should have issued hurricane warnings for New Jersey and New York, despite the storm’s hybrid nature, because such warnings typically garner a more significant public safety response than the warnings that were issued. On Nov. 2 Smith wrote: “[NWS’] decision not to issue a hurricane warning as a hurricane was approaching the coast was, in my opinion, disastrous. That is just my opinion. We need objective facts. To what extent did this decision influence Mayor Bloomberg and others to delay evacuations and/or make the evacuations less extensive than they should have been? Did this decision contribute to the drownings on Staten Island and elsewhere when the hurricane's storm surge overtook the island and the coastline?” The review team is expected to address those questions, and many more, during the next several months before issuing their report.

Photo Hurricane Sandy’s path, projected on Thursday at 11 p.m. by the National Hurricane Center.Credit //www.nhc.noaa.gov Under some of the most recent computer models, the hurricane is expected to move into the western Atlantic, lashing the Florida and Carolina coasts with rain and large waves. There is growing concern that Hurricane Sandy will then take a left turn toward the coast, possibly slamming into New Jersey by Tuesday with tropical-force winds, causing severe coastal and inland flooding and historic urban flooding in New York City, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some weather forecasters are calling the unusual combination of a hurricane and winter weather from the Midwest Frankenstorm, which inspired the creation of a Twitter account by that name. Forecasters are drawing comparisons to the so-called Perfect Storm of 1991, warning that the mix could cause mayhem, with downed power lines, flooding and high winds, from the Carolinas to New England and as far inland as Ohio. Some areas may be forced to cancel Halloween plans. “If it actually hits at the kind of intensity it might across central to northern New Jersey, that would be a potential worst-case scenario for New York City,” said Paul Kocin, a meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “That would maximize coastal flooding and winds for New York. The flooding could be of a level that would be rarely ever seen.” But Mr. Kocin cautioned that forecasts could change and that some computer models were showing that Hurricane Sandy, expected to move later this week into the western Atlantic before turning back toward the northern coast, could hit anywhere from the Carolinas to the DelMarva peninsula to the southern coast of New England. What is certain, however, is that the winter weather moving from the Midwest is setting the stage for a dangerous storm. “Without these two systems coming together, it is possible that the hurricane would remain harmlessly out at sea,” Mr. Kocin said. “The storm coming from the Midwest may cause the hurricane to not only make a left turn but make it more intense than it would be otherwise.” “The storm, wherever it comes in, is going to have a large impact over a lot of people, no matter what,” he said.

In New York City, Bloomberg administration officials activated the city’s coastal emergency plan, which led to the closing of the subway system and the evacuation of thousands of residents in low-lying areas during Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that some residents should prepare to evacuate. Our colleagues in City Room are noting descriptions of the storm. “There will be a lot of rain along the whole East Coast, certainly in Southern Florida, and then coming up,” Mr. Bloomberg told reporters on Thursday. “If this storm merges with another storm coming from the Ohio Valley, it has the potential to give you real weird weather, like snow, and a lot of rain and high winds. On the other hand, it might just go out to sea, and they just don’t know. What we are doing is we are taking the kind of precautions you’d expect us to do, and I don’t think anybody should panic.” Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, said during a briefing that federal emergency management officials had been working with local officials to prepare for the storm. He said people living along the Eastern Seaboard should monitor weather reports in the coming days. At least four people died in the Caribbean as a result of the hurricane, which is a Category 2 storm after making landfall in Cuba. But the death toll is expected to rise as reports come in from Haiti and Jamaica. Mary Murray, a producer for NBC News in Havana, reported the death toll was rising there. In Cuba alone, she said, officials are reporting that at least 11 people have died and the storm caused extensive damage in Santiago and other parts of the country. 11 dead in #Cuba from #Hurricane- 9 in #SantiagoDeCuba and 2 in #Guantánamo. 4 month old infant was from Santiago What's Next About The Lede is a blog that remixes national and international news stories -- adding information gleaned from the Web or gathered through original reporting -- to supplement articles in The New York Times and draw readers in to the global conversation about the news taking place online.

Hurricane Sandy Hurricane Sandy: Hurricane Sandy, sometimes called Superstorm Sandy, was the deadliest and costliest storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed in the central Caribbean on October 22nd and intensified into a hurricane as it tracked north across Jamaica, eastern Cuba and the Bahamas. Sandy moved northeast of the United States until turning west toward the mid Atlantic coast on the 28th and transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone just prior to moving onshore near Atlantic City, NJ. Estimated damage: $75 billion. Want something different than what you see in our video brief above? We have more clips available offline.

Read More Statistics Show Hurricane Sandy’s Extraordinary Intensity Hurricane Sandy obliterated many records along the East Coast, from its extraordinarily low air pressure to the storm surge. In some ways it was even worse than a worst-case scenario. Here is a roundup of some of the staggering statistics. A wave crashes on the shore of Lake Michigan. Waves generated by Hurricane Sandy's massive wind field battered the Chicago lakefront on Tuesday and Wednesday. Credit: Tom Skilling via jkleeman/Facebook. Air Pressure Records: - Sandy had a minimum central pressure of 946 mb when it made landfall, which was the second-lowest pressure of any storm to come ashore north of Cape Hatteras, N.C. Only the Hurricane of 1938 had a lower air pressure reading at landfall that far north, which was 941 mb. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. - Atlantic City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Trenton, N.J., all set records for the lowest air pressure reading ever recorded. At Atlantic City, which was close to the storm’s landfall location, the pressure fell to 945.6 mb, smashing the record of 961 mb, set in 1932. In Philadelphia, the pressure dropped to 953 mb, which broke the old record of 963 mb set during the “Superstorm of 1993.” What’s noteworthy about these air pressure records is that they show that the storm was even more intense than a worst-case scenario studied by MIT’s Kerry Emanuel and Princeton’s Michael Oppenheimer. They published a study in June that warned of New York City’s vulnerability to storm surge flooding, but the storm they modeled had a minimum central pressure of about 960 mb at landfall. In other words, their worst-case scenario storm wasn’t as intense as Hurricane Sandy turned out to be. Storm Surge As expected, the extremely powerful storm surge proved to be Hurricane Sandy’s fiercest weapon, as water overwhelmed defenses throughout coastal New Jersey, New York City, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.

Here are some of Sandy’s most significant storm surges – measured as feet above the average low tide: 14.38 feet - Kings Point, N.Y. 13.88 feet - The Battery, Lower Manhattan, which included a storm surge component of 9.23 feet. (Put another way, the water level at The Battery rose to 9.15 feet above the average high-tide line.) The storm surge at The Battery broke the old record, which was recorded during Hurricane Donna in 1960. It also broke the record of 11.2 ft. from a powerful hurricane that struck the region in 1821. Note that the Sandy Hook gauge stopped recording at 13.31 feet, so the actual highest water level was very likely higher than that. Winds: High winds affected the entire eastern third of the country, creating whitecaps on the surface of Lake Michigan at the same time that the Atlantic Ocean was still inundating coastal communities in the Mid-Atlantic states. Here are some of the strongest gusts: Rain and Snow: Heavy snow fell in Snowshoe, W.Va. Credit: Facebook/Alan Auglis. Unlike Hurricane Irene in 2011, Sandy did not produce devastating inland flooding, in part because it dropped less rain, and also because the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic had been quite dry leading up to the event. Still, there were some formidable rainfall totals, such as 12.55 inches in Easton, Md., and 11.91 inches in Wildwood, NJ. One of the most unusual aspects of this enormous storm was the crippling amount of heavy, wet snow it produced in the higher elevations of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia. Snow also fell in parts of Ohio. During a media conference call as Sandy was nearing landfall, Louis Uccellini, a leading expert on snowstorms and the director of the National Center for Environmental Prediction in College Park, Md., said he knows of no previous hurricane that also dropped such heavy snow.
Twitter rips Mitt with 'Romney's Storm Tips' for Hurricane Sandy By ANTHONY BARTKEWICZ |NEW YORK DAILY NEWS| Oct 29, 2012 | 3:01 PM Hurricane Sandy has set off a wave of Mitt Romney mockery in the twittersphere with the trending hashtag "#MittsStormTips" (Twitter) Mitt Romney's only official tweet about Hurricane Sandy is the number to text a Red Cross donation. But that's not much fun, so Twitter has picked up the slack and offered up some satirical storm survival tips in the GOP presidential hopeful's name. As the East Coast braced for Sandy's wrath Monday, the hashtag "#MittsStormTips" trended. Advertisement Faux-advice from the ultra-wealthy candidate included "Poor people make great flotation devices" and "Move your binders full of women and children to higher ground so they stay dry" - a riff on Romney's bizarre debate comment about women in the workplace. An account purporting to be Romney's accountant brought Missouri Rep. Todd Akin's bizarre theories on rape and abortion into the mix, quipping, "I've been told that if it's not a legitimate storm, Mother Nature will shut that whole thing down." Others took aim at things besides Romney's riches. "Pretend it's the Vietnam War and go to France," one person suggested. The hashtag turned into an account, @RomneyStormTips, devoted to poking fun at Romney. The account amassed nearly 40,000 followers, and eventually shifted from tweets of mock advice to a look at how Romney might wait out a hurricane.
Sandy’s forecast track has changed little over the last day. The hurricane is expected to continue northeast or north-northeastwards today. A turn to the north should commence this evening or tonight, and a turn to the northwest tomorrow morning. Landfall is expected in New Jersey Monday night. Further deepening of this system has occurred with pressures falling to 951mb. Sandy could either hold its own, or continue to deepen up until landfall. Impacts:Heavy Rain – Widespread areas of 3-8″ of rain with localized areas of >12″ of rain are likely along and to the left of this storm’s track as Sandy moves inland. This could lead to moderate-major river flooding in the Mid-Atlantic states. Near-coastal river flooding may be exacerbated by elevated tides. High Wind – Tropical Storm conditions have been reported in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and gusts over tropical storm force have been reported in Virginia. Damaging winds to hurricane force are expected to occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland to near coastal cities. Tropical Storm force/gale force winds (>39mph) are expected to occur well inland with damaging gusts over 50mph common. This could cause severe tree damage or defoliation and lead to power outages or even structural damage as far inland as southern Ontario and Quebec. Storm Surge – A storm surge of 2-5ft is occurring along the North Carolina, Virginia, and Delmarva coasts, this could increase further as Hurricane Sandy continues an onshore flow in this area. Sound-side flooding is likely also occurring in Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. In Long Island sound and in New York Harbor, expect peak storm surges of 6-11ft. Anywhere else with onshore gale force winds can expect storm surges between 4 and 8ft. These are very serious heights above mean tide level and if combined with a high tide cycle, could produce disastrous coastal flooding and damage in a highly populated area. This storm surge will be accompanied by large battering waves that could produce erosion and additional structural damage. Records for storm surge values in this region could be threatened and the infrastructure in place put to the test. On the Great Lakes, the prospect of lake length winds on Lake Michigan have prompted lake shore flood watches to be posted in Illinois and Indiana. High surf and onshore gale force winds there could cause localized lake shore flooding there, a similar threat exists for Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Heavy Snow – In the middle Appalachians in West Virginia, a combination of tropical moisture, up sloping winds, and cold air filtering in on the west side of Sandy will mix to dump heavy wet snow and bring gusty winds. Near blizzard conditions are possible here and winter storm watches are in effect calling for 1-2 feet of snow in the highest elevations above 3000feet in altitude. 2-6″ are possible below 2000feet in altitude in West Virginia. In areas where deciduous trees still have leaves, the combination of snow and winds will produce significant tree damage that could lead to power outages, the weight of the snow may even lead to some roof damage. Bermuda Weather Service radar image of a squally shower of the west end of the island that possibly produced a tornado at around 9am local time. Bermuda: Bands of showers are expected to move through tonight and tomorrow. Squally showers in these bands could contain tropical storm force winds and tornadic activity is a distinct threat here. The Bermuda Weather Service expects 35-40mph southwesterly winds with gusts to 65mph late tonight – but this could be confined to the western marine area. Elevated surf along the south shore will produce dangerous rip currents and significant beach erosion, while making it hazardous to be out on the water. Why no tropical storm/hurricane warnings for the Northeast/New England? Hurricane Sandy could transition into a post-tropical storm as it approaches. If the storm is no longer tropical, tropical storm and hurricane warnings cannot be in effect for it. In the event this happens, all warnings would have to be switched to those used for mid-latitude extra-tropical storms which could lead to confusion among the public. So to avoid confusion, they are starting warnings off as those for extra-tropical storms.
Cuomo, Schumer Tout Progress Made In 5 Years Since Sandy OCEANSIDE, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-New York) said the state – and particularly Long Island – have come a long way since Superstorm Sandy hit the area five years ago Sunday. “We survived Sandy,” Cuomo said as he appeared with Schumer in Oceanside, Long Island. “We built back stronger than ever before. We worked together. Senator Schumer got the federal government to deliver. The county – Nassau, Suffolk; the state all worked together – and we built back a better Long Island.” Schumer added, “We always knew Long Island would come back because of the spirit and toughness and strength and love of this beautiful area, and that’s what happened. It’s amazing how things have turned around.” Schumer said Long Island did not just rebuild, but rebuilt better and stronger so that everything would not risk being damaged or swept away again in the event of another hurricane or superstorm. “We said, ‘We’re not just going to rebuild.’ In the past, FEMA would just want to rebuild exactly what was there, and God forbid there’s another flood; another Sandy in the way – it would all go again,” Schumer said. “So we had to change the way FEMA worked, and said: ‘No, no, no – we’re going to build better and more resilient. We’re not just going to put the same stuff back.’ And we did.” He said homes have been elevated, roads are being built stronger, a program for shoreline protection all the way through suburban Long Island is in place, and a new boardwalk has been built at Long Beach – all using federal dollars. “We learned to build with resiliency, and put homes on piers, and buildings on piers. We learned to set up fuel reserves. We learned to have backup generators where we need them. We now have backup generators at all the key gas stations on Long Island. We learned to make our power grid more resilient,” Cuomo said. Cuomo took issue with anyone who might deny climate change – saying Sandy and other major storms serve as proof. “To deny climate change is to deny science is to deny reality. I mean, how much more proof do you want – one year after the other, every year hotter, the worst hurricanes, highest numbers of hurricanes. Let’s put it this way – either there’s climate change, or Mother Nature’s having a nervous breakdown, OK?” he said. Meanwhile, Schumer took a jab at Texas for fighting against federal money for Sandy relief – but said New Yorkers now stand with Texas and other states and territories that have been devastated by storms this year. “We said to our dear friends in the Texas delegation, who led the fight against Sandy money and voted against Sandy money – we’re not going to do the same to you. We’re Americans. We’re New Yorkers. When any area’s hurt, we stand up for that area that is hurt, no matter where they are,” Schumer said. “And I want to say to my colleagues, that also means Puerto Rico today, as well as Texas and Florida.” When Superstorm Sandy hit nearly five years ago, it was considered a 500-year storm. But experts now say a similar storm could strike in the next 20 years. Cuomo on Sunday also announced a $354 million state project to improve the water quality on the Western Bays of Long Island. The plan will diverted treated waste from the Bay Park Wastewater Treatment plant through an abandoned aqueduct near Sunrise Highway to the existing Cedar Creek Outfall – which diffuses treated sewage to the Atlantic Ocean. The project will prevent the discharge of 19 billion gallons of sewage into the warm, shallow Western Bays every year, Cuomo’s office said. Cuomo said the project represented another effort toward building back after Sandy.
Hurricane Sandy heading for US east coast early next week Hurricane Sandy has already ploughed through the Caribbean causing flash floods and loss of life in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti, with torrential rain and damaging winds. As of Friday lunchtime, Sandy is a category one storm and sitting over the Bahamas, with sustained winds of 80mph and stronger gusts. With the storm now growing in size, rain from the periphery of the sprawling storm is affecting eastern parts of Florida, along with tropical storm force winds. Although Sandy has already caused significant problems, the worst may be yet to come, with the storm predicted to directly hit the east coast of the US early next week. NASA video taken from the International Space Station showing hurricane Sandy over the Caribbean. At the moment, there is a large amount of uncertainty as to exactly where the hurricane will make landfall, but when it does hit, the impacts are likely to be significant, if not major. Current predictions have a range of possible landfall points, ranging from North Carolina to Long Island, New York. With this part of the US being densely populated, the cost of the storm and the potential danger it poses to live and property are high. Even though the precise point of landfall is unclear, the possible impacts are. Torrential rain As a storm that is tropical, Sandy contains a lot of moisture that has been drawn up from the warm ocean waters in the Caribbean. Wherever the storm ends up going, large amounts of rainfall can be expected within a few hundreds miles of its path. The five-day rainfall forecast from NOAA (below) issued on Friday suggests that states from the mid-Atlantic to the eastern Great Lakes could widely see 2-6 inches of rain, with the worst affected areas seeing 12 inches. This amount of rain falling in just a few days, especially in urban areas will give a significant risk of surface water flooding. In addition, as colder air tucks in around the western side of the storm, rain could turn to heavy snowfall and blizzards across the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Damaging winds Recent forecasts from the National Hurricane Center in Miami keep Sandy as a category one hurricane as it makes landfall, somewhere along the east coast of the US early next week. Sustained winds upon landfall are expected to be 70-80mph close to the centre of the storm, but winds of 40-60mph are possible across a wide area, with even stronger gusts. This strength of wind could blow down trees and power lines, potentially leaving millions of homes without electricity. Transport disruption is also highly likely, with poor conditions on roads and flights subject to delays or even cancellations. Coastal storm surge When the storm makes landfall, there’s going to be a storm surge along coastal areas on its northern side caused by onshore hurricane-force winds pushing water onto the coastline. With a full moon expected early next week, high tides will occur, which will only add to the water levels along the coastline. These factors combined would cause coastal flooding – especially for low-lying areas. This will be in addition to heavy rainfall that will exacerbate the problem further. Where can the latest forecast be found? Given the large amount of uncertainty with the exact track of hurricane Sandy, it is definitely worth keeping an eye on the latest forecast. The National Hurricane Center in Miami produces numerous updates each day that give the latest predicted path and impacts of the storm which can be found here. I’ll be keeping an eye on developments through the weekend and tweeting occasional updates from @liamdutton

National news NYC shutting down transit, evacuating 375,000 KateGibson Reuters Subway riders walk past a warning sign about potential service changes as they enter the Bowling Green station in New York on Saturday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the transit system to shut down Sunday night ahead of Hurricane Sandy’s arrival. NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — New York readied to shut down the nation’s largest mass transit system Sunday and ordered hundreds of thousands of residents to evacuate areas most at risk from potentially deadly storm surges created by the monster Hurricane Sandy. School was also canceled Monday for the city’s 1.1 million public school students, and floor trading was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange, as New York began shutting down before strong winds, rain and coastal flooding, forecast to hit midday Monday. Floor trading also was suspended on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but electronic trading was scheduled to continue. By 5 p.m., the Nasdaq electronic exchange operator hadn’t indicated it was changing plans to remain open Monday. As Hurricane Sandy remained on track for the country’s most populated city, officials on Sunday called a halt to bus, subway and commuter rail service and ordered 375,000 to leave low-lying areas in parts of Brooklyn, lower Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx. “We anticipate surge will hit a lot of low-lying areas (overnight) with possible flooding continuing into Tuesday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told a televised briefing Sunday. Forecasters had upped anticipated storm surge to between six and 11 feet above normal, he said. More than 76 evacuation shelters were open around the city. For residents living in public housing in impacted areas, the mayor warned elevators would stop running Sunday evening, “so it’s important that you leave this afternoon.” Physical floor trade would be suspend starting Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange, but it’s electronic trading system would continue to operate, NYSE Euronext said in a statement Sunday on its website. New Yorkers braced for the storm by stocking up on bottled water, batteries and food, with bread shelves empty at multiple stores. In Fort Green, Brooklyn, one woman stood in a 30-minute long line to buy a box of sugar and eight cans of cat food. Many businesses were closing earlier than normal to let their public-transportation taking workers get home ahead of service suspensions. Earlier Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the nation’s largest transit system would close, as Sandy, now the largest tropical storm in recent Atlantic history, extending nearly 1,000 miles from its center, continued on a path toward New York and New Jersey. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will suspend subway service, starting at 7 p.m., with the final Long Island Rail Road train and Metro North train leaving the city at the same time. MTA bus service suspension will start at 9 p.m. “We want people to stay at home,” said Cuomo of the decision to halt a transit system that serves some 15 million people in New York and surrounding areas of New York state, New Jersey and Connecticut. It’s dangerous to run trains in high winds, and officials also want to want to transit equipment from damage. Trains are “not intended to be submerged,” the governor said. “Monday and Tuesday are going to be difficult days,” said Joseph Lhota, the MTA’s chairman and CEO. Riders should not look for MTA service to resume for at least 12 hours after the end of the storm, Lhota said. Record surges were forecast for coastal areas. Forecasts calling for four to eight foot storm surges had been increased to predications of five to 10 foot surges, which would be a record,” Howard Glazer, New York’s director of state operations, told the briefing, held in Bethpage, N.Y. Parts of Suffolk County were being evacuated, with residents ordered to leave Fire Island, an island adjacent to Long Island, Sunday afternoon. Cuomo said it did not anticipate closing New York airports, but urged travelers to call ahead to check on flights. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 5,600 flight cancellations throughout the nation were blamed on Sandy, with many more expected. The forecast for New York City called the storm’s strongest impact to start midday Monday into early Tuesday, with sustained winds above 30 miles an hour to as high as 50 miles an hour, with gusts as high as 70 miles an hour. Downed trees and power lines were to be expected, along with power losses that could persist several days, officials said.

News Central Pennsylvania prepares for Hurricane Sandy (Undated) -- People across the midstate are gearing up for high winds and heavy rain, as Hurricane Sandy approaches. Pennsylvania is one of several states in the storm's path that have declared states of emergency. They include Maryland, Delaware and New York. Harrisburg Mayor Linda Thompson has declared a state of disaster emergency for the city. It goes into effect tomorrow mornig at 5:00 a.m. The National Weather Service has issued a high wind warning from 8:00 a.m. tomorrow until noon Tuesday. Winds are expected to reach up to 65 miles-per-hour during that time. A flood watch goes into effect late tonight through Tuesday evening. It means there's potential for flooding on small streams and creeks. Forecasters say the parts of the region could see up to six inches of rain by late Tuesday night. Electric utilities are bringing in crews and equipment from other states like New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, to assist with restoration efforts. “We strongly urge customers to prepare for the possibility of extended outages due to the enormity of Hurricane Sandy, which forecasters predict may become the worst storm to hit the Northeast in 100 years,” said Brian Wolff of the Edison Electric Institute. “Customers need to put safety first and take advance precautions should Hurricane Sandy disrupt service in their area and check their latest local weather forecasts.” Municipalities are reminding residents to stay clear of downed power lines, never touch anything that's come into direct contact with a power line and report them immediately. Stores in the region are reporting high-than-normal customer traffic, as folks pick up everything from water and bread to batteries, flashlights and generators. Grocery stores have planned for the increased demand and hope to have extra shipments of items on hand when the storm hits. Dennis Curtain, a spokesman for Weis Markets, says additional workers have been scheduled to meet the demand. "In the event of power outages, most of our stores have back-up generators, which allow them to run their front end systems," he wrote in an email to reporters. "We have to shut down and seal our cold and frozen cases, but we can sell dry groceries." Tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. on witf, Radio Smart Talk will focus on Hurricane Sandy and its potential impact on the midstate.

World This Scientist Helped Save New York's Subway From Superstorm Sandy The water just kept flowing. It streamed through the streets of lower Manhattan, pouring into subway entrances, cascading into ventilation grates and pooling inside tunnels. When Superstorm Sandy hit New York a year ago, it caused a massive, 14-foot storm surge, the likes of which the city had never seen. Nine out of the 14 subway tunnels beneath rivers around the city flooded, and the subway was shut down for days. But the Metropolitan Transit Authority took precautions to head off the worst impacts, experts say. Before the storm hit, the MTA moved its trains out of flood-prone areas, and took out the electric signals in the tunnels. The tunnels flooded. Afterward, subway workers pumped the water out, and replaced the electric signals. Within a week, 80% of subway service had been restored, newspapers reported. The MTA's preparations saved the city significant time and money in getting the system up and running again, said Klaus Jacob, a climate scientist at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York, one of the people perhaps most responsible for showing how such epic flooding would affect the city's subways. "Instead of the one to 10 days that much of the system was down, it would have been down at least three weeks, which saved the city on the order of $10 billion," Jacob said. That's two-and-a-half times the daily economic output of New York City, he added. A 100-Year Flood Jacob models the risks of extreme weather events and how climate change exacerbates them. He has been involved in long-term planning for sustainability, working with New York stakeholders, including the MTA, New Jersey Transit and others. Two years before Sandy, the New York governor's office commissioned a report on how the state should adapt to climate change; that report forecast the impact a 100-year flood — an event that has one-in-100 odds of a occurring in any given year — would have on the city's infrastructure. The study predicted that most of the city's subway tunnels would flood, probably in less than an hour. And if all 14 tunnels under the river were to flood, it would take about five days per tunnel to pump all the water out. The MTA took these threats very seriously, Jacob said. "It was clear," in the run-up to Sandy, he said, "that the MTA really had taken notice of the risk and started to prepare." Before Sandy hit, MTA employees moved their rolling stock (all vehicles that move on a railway) out of areas known to flood. Workers blocked off flood-prone subway entrances with plywood and sandbags. "It worked pretty much everywhere in the system except lower Manhattan," said MTA spokesperson Kevin Ortiz. (A giant inflatable plug, still under development, may have prevented more flooding.) In the subway tunnels, electrical signals, relays and other equipment — "any type of component that could be quickly removed" — were taken out and stored above ground. If the MTA had left the electrical signals to flood, it would have had to take them apart, dry them and reassemble them — a process that could take weeks, Jacob said. The equipment is 50 to 100 years old, and the replacement parts aren't sold anymore. Many of the report's predictions were "eerily verified" by Hurricane Sandy, Jacob said. But by heeding the report's warnings and developing strategies to minimize the impact of flooding, the MTA prevented a much longer subway closure, and saved the city billions of dollars, he said. But other transit operators weren't so foresighted. New Jersey Transit didn't move its trains before the surge hit, and lost a large part of its rolling stock as a result, Jacob said. When asked about the losses, NJ Transit declined to comment. The agency lost about a quarter of its total fleet, according to the NJ Transit website. One year later, 93% of NJ Transit's fleet is now operable. Not Out of the Woods The MTA's preparations for Hurricane Sandy were admirable — as good an outcome as could be expected under bad circumstances, Jacob said. But the city hasn't spent money on "hard changes" to protect transportation infrastructure from future severe-weather threats. "Are we as vulnerable today as we were on the day of Sandy? I would say yes," Jacob said. Making the necessary changes will take years and billions of dollars of investment, he added. For example, many of the subway tunnels with stations at the surface lie in flood zones. The ventilation grates are a hazard because floodwater easily flows into them. These grates should be sealed and replaced with ventilation systems like those already used in under-river tunnels, Jacob said. The technology is available, but it comes down to politics, he said. Storms like Sandy are sure to happen again, and their effects will only become more severe as the sea level rises. Ultimately, these problems won't be fixed by engineering solutions, but by retreat, Jacob said. All these solutions can do is buy time. "The bottom line is: We have not faced up to what climate change will cost the nation and the rest of world," Jacob said. Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Tropical Storm Sandy threatens the Caribbean GOES RGB Imagery of Tropical Storm Sandy south of Jamaica in the Central Caribbean. According to the National Hurricane Center, as of 11am EST October 23rd, Sandy had top sustained winds of 50mph and a minimum pressure of 993mb. The storm was headed north-northeast at 5mph. Last night, Tropical Depression 18 strengthened into Tropical Storm Sandy in the Central Caribbean. Sandy has continued to slowly strengthen this morning and is expected to become a hurricane in the next 48 hours. Steering currents around Sandy are currently very weak and the storm is only moving very slowly northwards towards Jamaica. As land is implicated, there are tropical cyclone advisories in effect: Tropical Storm conditions are likely in Jamaica in the next 36-48hours while hurricane conditions are possible somewhere in Jamaica as the center of Sandy comes onshore. However, the biggest threat for now appears to be heavy rainfall that could lead to life threatening flash flooding and mudslides in Jamaica, Haiti, and Eastern Cuba. Forecast track… Despite the currently weak steering currents, there is incredible model agreement on the track for the next three days – a northward drift that accelerates to a normal pace, taking Sandy over Jamaica, and Eastern Cuba and exiting the Caribbean into the Central Bahamas. After that point some forecast models have Sandy being picked up and taken out to sea by a trough descending from Newfoundland, possibly affecting Bermuda, while others have Sandy merging into a trough over the US East Coast, producing a potentially disastrous coastal storm with a heavy snow event inland. It is hard to discredit either solution because they both have support from our most reliable models. The National Hurricane Center’s forecast doesn’t extend that far into the future but it appears they prefer the forecast that has Sandy going out to sea. Keep in mind that the future track is very uncertain and Sandy should be monitored closely. Forecast Intensity… Sandy should continue to slowly organize and strengthen today as it is embedded in a very moist environment with apparently favorable atmospheric winds. However, Hurricane Hunters observed that the storm is tilted vertically and this will inhibit rapid intensification in the short term. If Sandy manages to align itself vertically, the storm has a better chance of strengthening at a more substantial pace. Regardless, Sandy should be a hurricane before crossing Jamaica. It is expected to then weaken to a tropical storm during the passage and stay at a reduced strength for its Cuba landfall.

Read More Hurricane Sandy Aims For East Coast As a ‘Frankenstorm’ By Andrew Freedman Published: October 25th, 2012 As Category 2 Hurricane Sandy continues to lash the Bahamas with strong winds, heavy rain, and a damaging storm surge, computer models were projecting even more dire scenarios for locations along the East Coast of the U.S. from Virginia north to Maine, with an intense, perhaps even historic, storm making landfall there early next week. Most projections from Thursday were indicating that Sandy will slam much of the northeastern corridor, home to about 50 million people, not to mention billions in expensive real estate and infrastructure. Because the storm may have hybrid characteristics of both a hurricane and a nor’easter — not to mention that it could hit on Halloween — the National Weather Service has dubbed the system “Frankenstorm.” A zoomed in view of Hurricane Sandy as it was rapidly intensifying on Wednesday. Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NOAA Environmental Visualization Laboratory. The storm will have a wide array of dangers associated with it, including record inland and coastal flooding, widespread damaging winds that could gust above hurricane force, and high_elevation snows. The Capital Weather Gang blog has a breakdown of what different tracks would mean for the nation's capital, illustrating the potential for disaster. The National Hurricane Center has already noted an expansion in the storm's wind field, and this trend is expected to continue for the next few days. Depending on the exact track of the storm, it could even have impacts as far west as Ohio and western Pennsylvania, which may receive wet snow in higher elevations. And with the presidential election as a backdrop, there could be widespread power outages, including in political swing states such as Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia, which could influence voting patterns on Nov. 6, Election Day. While confidence has increased that the storm will impact the East Coast, there remains considerable uncertainty about where Sandy will come ashore, or even if it will make landfall or just near the coast. The track and structure of the storm will help determine the impacts in places from Norfolk, Va., to Portland, Maine. Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and officials in several other states are already taking actions to prepare for the storm. New York is especially vulnerable to coastal flooding, and with astronomical high tides taking place at the same time as this storm, there is a significant potential for massive coastal flooding (again though, this depends on the exact storm track and intensity). Tropical Storm Irene, which passed over Manhattan in September 2011, came close to flooding part of the New York subway system, and this Frankenstorm has the potential to create an even larger storm surge. As hurricane Sandy moves northward, it is going to interact with powerful jet stream winds that are associated with a surge of cold Canadian air, at the same time that it draws heat from an unusually warm Gulf Stream current. That will allow Sandy to morph into a large-scale hybrid storm, one that is part hurricane, part nor’easter. A computer model simulation from the European model, showing the "Frankenstorm" A strong ridge of high pressure over the Canadian Maritimes and Greenland will help push the storm northwestward, into the Mid-Atlantic or New England, rather than allowing it to move out to sea. That will also make the storm a slow mover, which will only worsen the damage in affected areas. A ridge of such high pressure is known as a “blocking high,” and while its occurrence is not particularly unusual, its intensity is. Recent studies have shown that blocking patterns have appeared with greater frequency and intensity in recent years. Some scientists think that may be related to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which is one of the most visible consequences of manmade global warming. The 2012 sea ice melt season, which ended just one month ago, was extreme, with sea ice extent, volume, and other measures all hitting record lows. The loss of sea ice opens large expanses of open water, which then absorbs more of the incoming solar radiation and adds heat and moisture to the atmosphere, thereby helping to alter weather patterns. Exactly how weather patterns are changing as a result, however, is a subject of active research. While it is not unusual to have a high pressure area near Greenland, its intensity is striking for this time of year. As Jason Samenow of the Capital Weather Gang wrote on Wednesday, the North Atlantic Oscillation, which helps measure this blocking flow, "is forecast to be three standard deviations from the average — meaning this is an exceptional situation." On Thursday, Will Komaromi, a graduate student in meteorology at the University of Miami in Florida, wrote about the large-scale weather pattern that he says could make this storm event even more intense than the benchmark storms of the past, such as the so-called Perfect Storm in 1991, which occurred at the same time of year: “Normally a hurricane weakens as it moves northward, as it encounters an increasingly unfavorable environment. This means greater wind shear, drier air, and lower sea surface temperatures. However, with phasing events, the tropical system merges with the mid-latitude system in such a way that baroclinic instability (arising from sharp air temperature/density gradients) and extremely divergent air at the upper-levels more than compensates for a decreasingly favorable environment for tropical systems,” he wrote.

Read More Hurricane Isaac Spurs Design of Storm Surge Warnings By Andrew Freedman Published: September 17th, 2012 , Last Updated: September 16th, 2012 When they strike land, hurricanes bring a slew of threats ashore, from strong winds to flooding rains. The deadliest weapon in a hurricane’s arsenal is its storm surge, the wall of ocean water that the storm’s winds and very low air pressure push ashore. It was the storm surge from Hurricane Katrina, not strong winds, which overwhelmed inadequate levees in New Orleans in 2005, killing about 1,800 people. History is full of examples of catastrophic storm surge events, such as Hurricane Camille in 1969, which killed 259 people and flattened the Mississippi coastline under a wall of water nearly 30 feet high. Yet despite the fact that storm surge is the leading killer during hurricanes — and may become even more of a concern as seas rise in response to global warming — the National Weather Service (NWS) has never issued a weather warning specifically for this threat. Instead, storm surge has long been addressed as part of the broader hurricane warning system. The glaring absence of a storm surge-warning category was already recognized within the National Hurricane Center (NHC) prior to Hurricane Isaac, which was a Category 1 storm on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale when it made landfall in coastal Louisiana on August 28. But in the wake of that storm, which brought a significant storm surge that seemed to surprise thousands of low-lying coastal residents, there have been more calls to reform the warning system in order to more clearly communicate the storm surge threat to coastal residents. The low rating of Isaac presented a major challenge for NHC forecasters in Miami, local NWS offices in the hurricane-warning zone, as well as the media and emergency management officials. Many Louisiana residents simply looked at the Saffir Simpson rating and based their preparations on that, perhaps not realizing that, since 2010, the Saffir Simpson rating has not taken into account storm surge or the effects of heavy rainfall, which were the two biggest threats that Isaac posed. Despite its relatively weak sustained winds, Isaac was an unusually broad storm, and had a very low central pressure that was more characteristic of a strong Category 2 hurricane. Making the situation worse, it moved ashore at a snail’s pace, ensuring that flooding would occur during multiple high tides. Hurricane Isaac brought a storm surge of 6 to 12 feet or more above ground level to the Louisiana coast, a surge that was accurately forecasted by the NHC. Hurricane Isaac's winds and storm surge caused the Mississippi River to flow backwards for 24 hours on August 28, 2012, as data from this USGS gauge at Belle Chasse, La. shows. Click on the image for a larger version. Credit: USGS. Despite the NHC forecast, it seemed that many people were surprised that a Category 1 storm could push so much Gulf of Mexico water ashore. There were numerous rescues during the storm in low-lying LaPlace, St. Tammany, and Plaquemines Parishes, closest to where Isaac first roared ashore. Jamie Rhome, the storm surge lead for NHC, said the surge forecasts for Isaac were accurate, yet there may have been some breakdowns in the communications process down to the local level. “It’s hard to envision the forecast being any more accurate,” Rhome said. Hurricane Isaac, along with other recent storms, has helped advance work that was already underway at the NHC to improve public understanding of storm threats by devising new warnings and graphical communications tools. A storm-surge warning is among the measures that are currently being considered, along with more precise and engaging graphics showing anticipated inundation from storm surge. In addition, some meteorologists have been advocating for a new scale — or for modifications to the Saffir Simpson scale — that would incorporate the threat of flooding rains and storm surge. However, hurricane forecasters at the NHC are largely opposed to this idea. “Tropical cyclones cannot be easily categorized by storm surge because the surge is not a characteristic of the storm alone, being also dependent on the shape and bathymetry of the affected coastline, the storm’s forward motion, angle of approach, and so on,” the NHC said in a statement released in early September. Diagram of a hurricane storm surge. Credit: NOAA/COMET. “[The] NHC believes that the clearest way to communicate each of the hurricane hazards is to do so directly and distinctly, and not conflate them as the proposed integrated scales do,” the NHC said. In addition, the Hurricane Center said that combined scales can do more to confuse the public, since they don’t provide much information about which hurricane-related threat is going to affect them the most, and different threats require different responses. For example, for areas that will mainly face very strong winds, the Hurricane Center usually advises people to shelter in place, yet for storm surge, the recommended course of action is usually to evacuate. Instead of devising a new scale for rating tropical storms and hurricanes, Berg and his NHC colleagues favor improving the forecast products they issue. To do this, they have tapped into the expertise of social scientists, who are helping forecasters understand how people interpret graphics and process information. “This is a new thing,” Berg said. “Most of the time the National Weather Service has done things by themselves.” Rhome said that the old way of doing things was all based on physical sciences, and the results were often lackluster communications’ products that confused people. Now, however, the goal of clear communication is the main driver behind developing new forecast products, he said. “At least from my perspective, it is a bit of a paradigm shift. “The scientific community has been trained to design graphics that are inherently complicated,” said Gina Eosco, a risk communications expert at Cornell University who is working with the Hurricane Center to rethink the way the Hurricane Center communicates the storm surge threat. Eosco said a major challenge is ascertaining how to convey to people that each storm packs a unique punch. “Every hurricane is like a fingerprint; every one is different,” she said. Some changes to storm forecasts have already been made. For example, text-based storm-surge information is now expressed as “depth of water above ground,” rather than “feet of water above normal tide levels,” which is how it used to be communicated. The old standard required coastal residents to look up the normal tide levels on the day a storm was making landfall and then add in the expected surge to arrive at the expected inundation level. The next step is the inundation graphic, which will represent a shift away from text-based warning information. “It’s very hard to envision storm surge with text,” Rhome said. As for the timeline on these new products, Rhome and other experts interviewed said the inundation graphics could be rolled out as soon as next year, while the warnings will have to go through an experimental phase before officially being added to the roster of NWS watches and warnings.
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Monday, October 29, 2012 Hurricane Sandy is What We Feared Photo by Roberta Teer via Facebook Flooded, Dark Lower Manhattan. Via The Weather Channel, three feet of water is flooding the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Water has flooded into the NYC subway and the NY-NJ Path railroad. The Statue of Liberty is dark. Both LaGuardia and JFK Airports are flooded, extent unknown. Wind gust of 94 mph at Eaton's Neck, NY confirmed by NWS. 2.5 4.0 million homes and businesses are without power as far away as Athens, GA. Winds as far west as Cleveland are gusting over 60 mph. A full-fledged blizzard is in progress in the Appalachians. Rivers will begin rising rapidly and major river flooding will occur over the next few days. There really isn't much more to say at this point. If you'll scroll down below, you'll see the forecasts that are still valid. If you are affected by the storm: Hang in there. It may take a while but this, too, shall pass.

It blasted the ocean itself over dunes, seawalls and berms and into downtowns, tunnels and subways. It killed dozens of people, destroyed famed landmarks and amusement parks, pushed houses off their foundations and toppled trees. It virtually shut down New York City, the nation's largest city, with major airports, highways, and bridges and tunnels in and out of Manhattan shut down, just as they were after 9/11. For millions of people in New York City and elsewhere, the lights remain out, communications remain down and floodwaters, downed trees and power lines still make roads impassable. However, some of the hardest-hit areas on the East Coast were beginning to take the first steps towards recovery. For instance, some New York bridges, tunnels, highways and airports reopened or were slated to be reopened by Wednesday morning. So far, Sandy has been blamed for the deaths of at least 50 people, according to The Associated Press, and left more than 8 million customers without power. The number of dead continued to rise by the hour a day after the storm made landfall near Atlantic City, N.J., and rocked states including New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina and West Virginia. "I just never thought I would see what I saw today -- ever," New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said. "It won't be same. It will be different because many of the iconic things that made it what it was are not gone and washed into the ocean." The power outages were spread over 17 states, from Virginia to Maine, and while the number of customers affected topped 8 million, the number of people living without power would be several times that number. The number of power outages topped 2 million customers in New Jersey and half a million in New York City, and approached another million on New York's Long Island. President Obama issued disaster declarations for New York and New Jersey so that federal aid will be offered to the affected areas to help supplement state and local clean-up efforts. During a visit to the Red Cross headquarters in Washington, D.C., this afternoon, Obama sent a very clear message to federal agencies. "Do not figure out why we can't do something. I want you to figure out how we do something," the president said. "I want you to cut through red tape. I want you to cut through bureaucracy. There's no excuse for inaction at this point. I want every agency to lean forward and to make sure that we are getting the resources where they need -- where they're needed as quickly as possible." The president said mayors and governors who run into any trouble can call him directly at the White House. He praised the heroic efforts of rescuers and helpful community members, but emphasized that recovery is going to take some time. "It is not going to be easy for a lot of these communities to recover swiftly, and so it is going to be important that we sustain that spirit of resilience, that we continue to be good neighbors for the duration until everybody is back on their feet," Obama said. Among the hardest hit were New Jersey and New York, where public transportation was shut down, millions lost power and storm surges swamped cars, homes, businesses and boardwalks. But in the wake of the devastation, states are beginning to make moves toward comebacks. In New York, the New York Stock Exchange is scheduled to reopen on Wednesday after being closed for an unprecedented two days. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was scheduled to ring the opening bell. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the area's airports and bridges, said it plans to have two major airports -- John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, N.Y., and Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey -- open Wednesday morning at 7 a.m. with limited service. However, LaGuardia Airport in New York City will remain closed amid flooding on the tarmac and other damage. Public transportation in the city also screeched to a halt as the subway system, rail yards and bus depots were flooded in what officials called the biggest disaster of its 108 years in existence. "The New York City subway system ... has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night," MTA Chairman Joe Lhota said in a statement. All bridges into Manhattan were reopened today and limited bus service was to resume this evening -- though the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel remained submerged beneath floods. The Holland Tunnel also remained closed though the Lincoln Tunnel was reopened early Tuesday. Officials hoped to have power restored to New York in two to three days and aim to have the subways running in three to four days, Bloomberg said. It will take about a week for PATH trains between New Jersey and New York to resume service. "This was a devastating storm, maybe the worst that we have ever experienced," Bloomberg said at a news conference today. Obama will visit ravaged New Jersey on Wednesday, where search and rescue missions have become a priority. A berm in Bergen County, N.J., was breached this morning, resulting in four to five feet of water flowing into three towns and endangering as many as 2,000 people, said Jeanne Beratta, spokeswoman for the Bergen County Office of Emergency Management. "We're doing rescues by boat. We're doing rescues with large trucks. We're doing rescues all over those areas," Baratta told "Good Morning America." "It's going to continue all day because now we're just search and rescue." New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that the state "kind of took it in the neck worse than any other place," but praised Obama and his administration for how it has handled the crisis. "[Obama] called me last night around midnight to ask what else can be done," Christie told "GMA." "I have to say, the administration, the president himself and FEMA administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far. We have a great partnership with them and I want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this." Other parts of the country were struggling with snow and blizzard conditions. West Virginia was under a blizzard warning and more than two feet of snow was reported in some parts of the states. More than 100,000 customers are without power. Sandy also brought winter conditions from North Carolina to Pennsylvania, and into Ohio. The former hurricane had joined forces with a cold front coming from the northwest and a high pressure system from Greenland to dump snow on eight states. Davis, W.Va., has been blanketed with 17 inches of snow, which continued to fall into the early morning. By Thursday, meteorologists predict up to three feet of snow was possible in higher elevations. New York University Medical Center was among the millions left without power in the wake of Sandy. A full evacuation was under way after the hospital's back-up generators had failed. Early this morning, approximately 200 patients had been evacuated by private ambulance with assistance from the FDNY. John Miksad, senior vice president for electric operations at Con Edison, said it was too soon to say when power could be restored and that inspectors would be out once it was daylight to assess the damage. Sandy was downgraded from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm shortly before it made landfall at 8 p.m. in Atlantic City, N.J., on Monday. By late Tuesday evening, Sandy remained a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Though it was weakening over Pennsylvania, it churned up the waters of the Great Lakes, prompting gale warnings and small craft advisories in some locations, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast states remained under flash flood watches and warnings.

Wednesday, October 31, 2012 The Unsung Heros of Hurricane Sandy Mike projects the damage to be over $100 billion for Hurricane Sandy as the eyewall is about to make landfall Mike and I spent the better part of the day Sunday in the car driving to St. Louis for 2 speaking engagements on Monday, one for the Chesterfield Missouri Rotary Club and secondly, as the keynote for the first annual Sustainable Disaster Recovery Seminar at St. Louis University. I got to see first hand the level of dedication and service to others that Mike devotes during a extreme weather emergency over the weekend. Mike was working in the car on the trip over, answering emails, conducting two interviews over the phone, one to USA Today and the other to a Kansas newspaper, following the latest radar images, blogging about the storm and what to expect, and putting survival information out on twitter and facebook. He told me that he was up working until 3:00 a.m. monitoring the storm as it raged through the night. Mike offers timely information to members of the audience on how to Survive, Revive and Prosper after the event of extreme weather at the St. Louis Sustainable Disaster Recovery Seminar on Monday Mike made sure that both of his audiences had the latest up-to-date information on Hurricane Sandy before he even started his scheduled presentation. We can thank the unsung heros who kept us informed and gave the east cost time to prepare for a storm of this magnitude. I believe, if it were not for the heroic efforts of the local and national meteorologists, the National Weather Service, the National Hurricane Center, AccuWeather and passionate scientists like Mike Smith, the death toll would be much higher. We are always thankful and appreciative of the service that the first responders and fire and emergency professionals give us in times like this, but I think we should also thank the meteorologists working behind the scenes who were the modern day Paul Reveres in this situation. Thankfully the death toll was not higher than it was due to such advanced warnings. Well done! If you would like to read the story of how this warning system came to be it can be found in Mike's book WARNINGS: The True Story of How Science Tamed the Weather.

The Manhattan skyline as Hurricane Irene approached last year. Sandy could hit New York City next week. Photograph: KeystoneUSA-Zuma/Rex Features The 2011 meteorological autumn was unusual in that both a hurricane and an October snowstorm hit the north-east. They occurred two months apart, and the idea that either one would happen again in the near-term was not something high up on the probability scale. But if there is one thing more unpredictable than politics, it's the weather. Government forecasters are warning that the US east coast is likely to be battered next week, not by a winter storm or a hurricane, but by an unusual combination of steady gale-force winds, flooding, heavy rain and possibly snow. It has already been dubbed the "snor'eastercane". Hurricane Sandy is currently approaching the Bahamas. With 105mph winds and a central low pressure of 964 millibars, Sandy seems likely at this point to hit the east coast of the United States. Where and how Sandy will make her mark is still very much up in the up air. Here's what we know for sure: the National Hurricane Center's latest track has Sandy staying well off the coast for the next 72 hours. Pretty much all weather models agree on this track. Most often that a storm such as Sandy would go out to sea at this point – following the warm waters of the Gulf stream. Graphic: National Hurricane Center The kicker here is that the jet stream, which carries weather systems across the country, is coming along at the perfect time and will block the eastward movement of Sandy. The jet will force the storm to head due north. The jet should then pick up the storm and bring it back towards to the coast. The result is a five day projection of Sandy as a tropical storm (ie winds of 39-74mph) into New York City by Tuesday midday. Graphic: National Hurricane Center Note how there is a wide range of uncertainty in Sandy's track. You should embrace that uncertainty because there is a large degree of unknown at this point. We don't know exactly how Sandy will interact with the jet. The European model has a most forceful merging of the jet with Sandy and turns it into the coast somewhere around Virginia. That would lead to tremendous winds and coastal erosion to the north-east of there including New Jersey and up to New York City. This solution is mostly supported by the US navy model among others. Earlier runs of the American GFS were on the opposite end of the spectrum, with less interaction with the jet stream causing the storm to make its way up to Maine before turning inward. That would lead to less impact further to the south as the strongest winds are on the north-eastern side of tropical storms. I must admit it I'm not really buying this solution as the latest run of the GFS is starting to look more like the middle ground spoken about below. The middle ground track at this point seems to be the GFS ensembles and last night's run of the Canadian model. These models take Sandy parallel with the coast up to about the North Carolina/Virginia border before making a sharp left turn and into the New Jersey/New York City area. This solution would lead to heavy winds and rain on the order of perhaps a foot or more into the New York City metropolitan area. There would likely be coastal evacuations around New York City. Heavy rains could also extend back into areas away from the center such as Philadelphia. Again though, this middle ground is merely one scenario, and we're many days away. Within these different tracks, one thing is very clear: the storm is going to be very powerful. The models are printing out central low pressures of between 935 and 950 millibars. The lowest pressure on hurricane Isaac earliest this year was 968 millibars. What does that mean? This low pressure indicates that even if you aren't in the center of the storm you're going to get hit pretty hard if you are anywhere near it. That's why the exact track of Sandy isn't as important as it might be otherwise. You'll see at least some rain from the Carolinas all the way up into New England. Combine this with a full moon, and there is going to be some major flooding along the coast for many miles. The reason for this extremely low pressure is again due to the jet interaction. The air the jet stream is ushering in is rather cold. In fact, it's snowing right now in Minnesota. When you combine this cold air with the warm air of a cyclone of tropical origin, you're bound to get rapid intensification. The rapid intensification will also help to drag down cold air that the jet is ushering in as atmospheric heights drop. Snow is unlikely in the big cities, but snow seems possible to the west-south-west of wherever the storm hits. It's this sector where we will have moisture as well as a cutting off of the warm air associated with the cyclone. You could get some good snow in the Northern Appalachian Mountains with perhaps minor accumulations from State College to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and up to Buffalo, New York, if the middle ground track came to fruition. Like the rest of the storm, we don't know where that snow line is going to be just yet and how much will fall where rain changes over to snow. Overall, Sandy does not seem to be messing around. It's about as much the real deal as a storm can be at this point. We'll have to keep an eye out where the storm ultimately decides to go in the coming days.

Hurricane Sandy, five years later: 'No one was ready for what happened after' Hurricane Sandy still assails the thoughts of Annie Willis, haunting her with its onrushing black water and the harrowing sound of shattering windows. The storm mauled a cherished home that Willis and her family are still unable to return to, five years since it ravaged New York City. “I’d seen nothing like it in my life, the water was surging above the cars. It was like an out of body experience,” Willis, now a 20-year-old student, said. She lived with her mother, brother and dog in far Rockaway, part of a jawbone-like peninsula that juts out near JFK airport in Queens. The stricken home was boarded up, with repairs still not done, as the family was shunted between hotels and relatives. “It’s incredibly frustrating,” Willis said. “I can’t believe it has been five years. It’s like no one was ready for what happened after the storm.” The lingering anguish of Sandy is shared by several hundred others in New York and New Jersey who have been unable to return home since the storm hit. Their houses lie derelict or in an ossified state of repair, with residents plagued by a confusing tangle of bureaucracy, delays, contractor fraud and the fear that any rebuilding in vulnerable areas will be nullified by another storm. A program called Build It Back was meant to have restored damaged New York City homes – such as the Willis’s – by the end of 2016, but one in five eligible people still haven’t had their dwellings repaired. The water was surging above the cars. It was like an out of body experience Annie Willis, survivor The city’s public housing is in a particularly parlous stasis – of the 33 apartment towers that required repair work on crippled heating and lighting systems, only one property has completed work. Protestors will march on Sandy’s fifth anniversary to highlight those still struggling with the storm’s aftermath. “There have definitely been problems along the way, it hasn’t gone smoothly,” said Amy Peterson, the city-appointed head of Build it Back. Peterson predicts the final repairs will take place in 2018. Around 300 homes were demolished and more than 1,400 homes have been elevated, by as much as 9ft, which has proved complex work in tightly-packed neighborhoods. “It hasn’t been easy, it’s been incredibly complicated,” Peterson said. “No one anticipated this level of damage.” Unnervingly, as New York and New Jersey continue to mop up from Sandy, far stronger hurricanes have recently pummeled Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. Donald Trump’s administration has also taken an axe to measures that address climate change – which is known to amplify hurricanes – as well as tear up federal rules requiring adaption to sea level rise. The skyline of Manhattan went dark after a power outage caused by the storm “It’s such ridiculous theater, it’s shameful,” said Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist who works on climate change adaptation at Columbia University. “New York has made some progress since Sandy but it’s hard to know if we will recover from the step backwards with the current administration. It will not cost this nation not only in billions, it will cost it trillions of dollars if we don’t turn things around.” After forming as a tropical depression off the coast off Nicaragua, Sandy mustered enough strength to become a category 1 hurricane, triggering mudslides that killed more than 50 people in Haiti as it roiled the Caribbean. Sandy then turned north, heading parallel to the US east coast before crunching into New Jersey, near Atlantic City, on the evening of 29 October 2012. By now the hurricane is no longer; Sandy becomes a tropical storm. But it is still strong enough to obliterate parts of the Jersey shore and trigger a record storm surge in New York harbor. Bolstered by a high tide, around 14ft of water careens into the southern tip of Manhattan, flooding subway stations and the foundations of the under-construction 9/11 memorial. The electricity in the world’s financial powerhouse flickers and dies. In parts of New York and New Jersey, power isn’t restored for several weeks. More than 100 people lose their lives, with economic damage of around $75bn. Rachel Riveria was watching the progress of the storm on TV in her top floor apartment in Brooklyn when she heard a cracking noise. As she checked on her sleeping six-year-old daughter, Riveria witnessed the ceiling caving in on her, only narrowly escaping the room with the child in her arms. “My daughter was terrified, she still cries to this day when it rains,” Riveria, who is now 38-years-old. “They say time heals wounds but this 11-year-old is still hurting. She hasn’t healed.” Barefoot, the duo fled into the storm and found their way to a shelter. They spent nearly two years being moved to various hotels by charities as Riveria’s landlord gave up on repairing the building. Finally, stable accommodation was found for them but not in the same area of Brooklyn. Disaster still looms large – Riveria’s mother was rescued when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September, although her sister is still missing. A family friend was found crushed to death under a car. Back in New York, Riveria frets a storm will revisit her, too. “People need to open their eyes,” she said. “Wherever there’s disaster, there needs to be help. The working class are the backbone of this country, we aren’t expendable. And we need to do something about climate change. All this drilling for fossil fuels, all those bad fumes. We need to change that.” ‘No fundamental change’ Damage in the Rockaway neighborhood of Queens during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 In Staten Island, houses remained boarded up five years later New York’s anti-flooding bulkheads have been strengthened, the subway system has a new mechanism to prevent inundation and new safeguards are in place to ensure the city’s lights stay on and the running water remains clean. Streets have been raised in some places and Rockaway’s five-mile boardwalk, left warped and crumpled by Sandy, has reopened. A rezoning process has altered rules for buildings in vulnerable areas, such as the southern edge of Brooklyn, the east side of Staten Island and the East Village area of Manhattan. But no areas have been completely barred from development and hard decisions over the viability of increasingly soggy parts of the city have been largely deferred. “If Sandy happened again this year I think New York would be operationally better prepared, people would follow evacuation orders better,” said Jacob. “But the water would still go in the same places, streets and houses would be flooded, there would be havoc in the Rockaways and Coney Island. It’s still the same set up. There’s been fiddling around the margins but no fundamental change.” The biggest lurch from the status quo has occurred in Staten Island, where residents in the low-lying east shore neighborhoods of Oakwood Beach, Graham Beach and Ocean Breeze have been offered money to sell up and leave. The $200m relocation, overseen by New York State, has seen 495 out of 659 eligible households take the voluntary buy-outs. Irene put these people back on their heels and Sandy was the knockout punch. It was like ‘boom, we are out’ Joe Tirone, real estate broker The area was ravaged by Sandy and several people perished. A lesser blow was struck a year before by Hurricane Irene. Still, Joe Tirone, a local real estate broker, said it was a surprise when he asked who was interested in buy-outs at a community meeting and was faced with a forest of raised hands. “Irene put these people back on their heels and Sandy was the knockout punch,” he said. “Sandy hit and it was like ‘boom, we are out.’” The east shore of Staten Island is marshy land and most residents – many of them police and fire fighters – have multi-generational roots in the area. But the community-led effort to get buy-outs came after it dawned on householders that climate change would eventually outpace them. “I drove around after the storm, houses were gone and it was just swamp,” said Tirone, who advocated on behalf of the community. “The city was still issuing building permits and I just thought ‘how did these houses ever get built?’” Jan Nuzzo, now a 37-year-old medical assistant, was recuperating at her Oakwood Beach house in Staten Island following the cesarean section delivery of her son, who arrived a month before Sandy struck. For five hours her house filled with water, forcing her to clamber atop furniture with her infant son and dog. At one point she had to change his diaper while lying him on a sofa that had just floated past. “I was waiting to either die or be rescued,” said Nuzzo. The national guard reached Nuzzo at 2am and from that moment she vowed never to return. She got a buy-out, moving elsewhere in the borough, and now a vacant lot stands where her house once did. Large chunks of the eastern part of Staten Island has been effectively handed back to nature - tall reeds sprout from empty plots of land, deer roam and opossums scurry around the houses that remain. A surge in turkey numbers prompted a cull. “We all know the water is rising now,” Nuzzo said. “People absolutely should not have lived in the area we were. It’s a marsh. Everyone loves an ocean view, but it shouldn’t cost you your life. We just wanted to get out and get on with our lives.” Tricia Campbell McAvoy at her home in Brick, New Jersey, which was hit badly by the storm. Five years later, she is still unable to move back ‘The storm is the easy part. Restoring your life is the challenge’ A recent survey of 500 New Jersey families affected by Sandy found one in five still have not returned home, with a third admitting it’s now a struggle to meet bills and afford food and fuel. A separate Monmouth University poll revealed than more than half of affected New Jersey residents are unhappy with the state’s recovery effort. Tricia Campbell McAvoy, 67, has sunk her life savings into repairing her house in Brick, New Jersey, a town riven by waterways near the coast, about 60 miles south of New York City. Sandy brought 3ft of water into her house, forcing McAvoy and her son to flee in a truck and her husband to be rescued by kayak. McAvoy planted a sign reading “looters will be shot and thrown into the river” outside her house and set about trying to make it habitable again. But a series of misfortunes, bureaucratic dawdling by local, state and federal officials and a botched elevation of the house by a rogue contractor mean she still lives with her 100-year-old father in his small, box-filled apartment. Her husband passed away shortly after the storm. People here love the ocean. This is where they want to stay. But at some point we will be underwater Lance White, Mantoloking council “The storm is the easy part – restoring your home and your life is the challenge,” she said, surveying the detritus inside a house that has been unhabitable since 2012. McAvoy has had two stokes, takes around a dozen pills a day and, like Willis, doesn’t like returning to her wrecked home. She shakes and weeps as she surveys it. “Life was good before this,” she said. “I had a beautiful life, I had a husband. So many people around here have become sick and died because of the stress of this storm.” Brick’s wealthier neighbor of the east, the town of Mantoloking, is attempting to make nature bend to its will. Sandy caused damage to almost every one of the 524 houses in the seaside town, perched on a narrow barrier island that has a bay on one side and the Atlantic on the other. Around 60 homes were utterly destroyed. In order to get flood insurance and to avoid a similar fate, multi-million dollar homes have been elevated by up to 14ft. Visitors have to scan upwards to find vertiginous front doors. Diggers are working to mould sand dredged from the seabed into protective beach dunes that will reach 22ft. To the south, in Seaside Heights, a rollercoaster that was washed out into the sea by Sandy has a gleaming new replacement, also placed on a short pier overhanging the waves. “We are at risk, there’s no doubt about it, but people hope they will lift their home and survive it, for now,” said Lance White, president of New Jersey’s Mantoloking council. “People here love the ocean, they love the beach. This is where they want to stay. But at some point we will be underwater.” A new home being built in Mantoloking, New Jersey Left, a new rollercoaster in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, on the same site where another washed away. Right, an artificial barrier now surrounds the beach in the Midland neighborhood of Staten Island ‘The threats are out there and growing’ Climate change’s hand in Sandy was identified in a 2013 study that found sea level rise, driven by the melting of glaciers and thermal expansion of a warming ocean, extended the reach of the storm by 27 sq miles, affecting 83,000 additional people. Heavy blows like Sandy may soon become quotidian – research released this week by Rutgers University estimated that 8ft floods, which used to occur once every 500 years, will batter New York every five years within the next three decades. Such scenarios are invoked by Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor, in his push to cut the city’s greenhouse gas emissions and in his excoriation of Trump for aiming a “dagger straight at the heart of New York City” by pulling the US from the Paris climate agreement. Things haven’t been perfect but we are moving as fast as we can. We will be at this the rest of our lives Daniel Zarrilli, New York City’s climate change chief City Hall has thrown its weight behind a coastal defence system, nicknamed the big U, that would hug lower Manhattan in a 10-mile perimeter. Work on the $750m project is set to begin in early 2019 and will take several years to complete. The big U is vying with other ideas such as a huge barrier that would stretch from New Jersey to the Rockaways and envelop New York harbor, closing it off during a storm. Ostensibly supported by New York governor Andrew Cuomo, the initiative would cost around $25bn. Neither of these huge projects would be infallible. The big U would provide a buffer from storm surge but should New York suffer the sort of downpour experienced recently by Houston – when the Texan city was drenched in 25 trillion gallons of water during Hurricane Harvey – lower Manhattan would fill like a bathtub. An illustration of the big U, a flood-mitigation design for Manhattan A barrier is more ambitious but the continual onslaught of sea level rise – New York City is likely to get a 1-2ft increase by mid century that could balloon to as much as 6ft by 2100 – means the barrier could spend more time closed than open, causing flooding behind it as water piles up from the East and Hudson rivers. “When we are finished (with the big U) it would be absurd to say everything will be safe but we are reducing vulnerabilities,” said Daniel Zarrilli, New York City’s climate change and resiliencechief. Climate change will likely wreck their livelihoods – but they still don't buy the science Read more “We know the threats are out there and growing. Things haven’t been perfect but we are moving as fast as we can. We will be at this the rest of our lives.” At some point, New York may be forced into what Columbia’s Jacob diplomatically calls “sustainable relocation” – parts of the city are allowed to flood, creating a sort of Venice in places like lower Manhattan where bridges and boats connect skyscrapers. “Let Canal Street be a canal, let Water Street be water,” Jacob said. “People may feel temporarily safe behind the big U but it’s like declaring war and then not having a strategy on how to extract yourself from that war. It’s a purely defensive strategy. “We should move critical assets such as hospitals and schools to higher ground and reduce density at lower ground. With the storms and flooding, some corporations will start to think about it. We will probably make it to mid century but beyond that – it’s all up for grabs.”

Read More Heeding Sandy’s Lessons, Before the Next Big Storm By Andrew Freedman Published: April 30th, 2013 , Last Updated: April 30th, 2013 It has been six months since Hurricane Sandy redrew the northern Mid-Atlantic coastline with its record storm surge and strong winds, paralyzing New York City for days, all the while offering a disturbing preview of what future storms may do to other coastal locations as sea levels continue to rise. The storm killed 159, caused upwards of $70 billion in damage, and led to the release of nearly 11 billion gallons of untreated and partially treated sewage into Mid-Atlantic waterways, enough to cover all of New York’s Central Park 41 feet deep. There are myriad lessons that have emerged from the storm, but here are four key issues deserving of special attention.

First and foremost, Sandy drove home the need to rethink coastal development practices that encourage growth in vulnerable areas. Second, the storm, which was forecasted well in advance, proved the value of a robust weather and climate forecasting infrastructure at a time of budget austerity. Third, Sandy revealed a disconnect between the weather community, emergency management officials, and the public when it comes to warnings about an unusually complicated severe weather hazard. Finally, while direct links between the storm and climate change are difficult to discern, it should be seen as ushering in a new era of consequences for coastal areas due to the combination of long-term, global warming-related sea level rise and storm surges from hurricanes, Nor’easters, and other storms. Lesson 1: Rethink Coastal Development Hurricane Sandy delivered a clear message that the relentless pursuit of coastal development needs to be rethought. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 39 percent of the U.S. population lives in counties directly on the shoreline, and if current population trends continue, that coastal population will grow to nearly 134 million from 122 million by 2020. In Sandy’s wake, federal flood insurance policies that subsidize growth in vulnerable areas are being re-evaluated, as are state and local regulations that have inadvertently put people in harms’ way. One federally funded program in New York is allowing the government to buy out homeowners who have damaged property in the most prone locations, rather than encouraging them to rebuild. But as the New York Times reported on April 26, that program is being met with mixed success, as many storm victims are choosing to rebuild rather than move. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has repeatedly emphasized the need to redevelop the state’s coastline in a smarter, more storm-resistant way. “We can never make up for the hardship that people went through,” he said at an April news conference, “but we can use this as a learning and an improving opportunity.” Coastal flooding in Mantoloking, N.J., as taken from a New Jersey Air National Guard Helicopter. Credit: NJNG/Scott Anema. Cuomo’s message, though, has not done much to change the status quo. Policy makers have not come anywhere close to settling on a broader plan to protect New York City from another damaging storm-surge event. Projects, such as building a surge barrier at the entrance to the harbor, for example, largely remain at the drawing-board stage. “There has been much more talk than action in rethinking coastal development. Many landowners have chosen to rebuild in place, meaning they’re willing to take the risk of another Sandy,” said Michael Gerrard, a law professor who directs Columbia University’s Center for Climate Change Law. “Few, if any, firm rules have been issued by any agency,” Gerrard said. “No announcements have been made of major changes in the siting of infrastructure. We seem to be witnessing, for the most part, a continuation of business as usual, with a twinge of anxiety and a lot of meetings.” For the insurance industry, Hurricane Sandy was another example of the rising costs of natural disasters, and a warning of the coming consequences due to sea level rise and extreme weather events. According to the reinsurance company Swiss Re, Hurricane Sandy cost at least $70 billion in total damage, with $35 billion in insured losses. “Hurricane Sandy was a wake-up call that our coastlines are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges from rising sea levels. Low-lying coastal areas with dense concentrations of property may no longer be suitable for building and rebuilding. Difficult decisions will need to be made,” said Cynthia McHale, who directs the insurance program at Ceres, which is a national coalition of investors and environmental organizations focused on sustainability. She said insurers are raising rates in coastal locations, while pushing for governmental action to reduce the risk of more damaging events. “We have a choice: to either gamble on bigger long-term risks or preemptively invest to make vulnerable coastal cities more climate resilient, thereby making today’s at-risk areas more insurable,” McHale said. Lesson 2: Invest in Weather and Climate Infrastructure For weather forecasters, Hurricane Sandy was largely a success story, as advances in remote sensing and computer-modeling techniques enabled meteorologists to accurately predict the storm’s path nearly one week in advance. Crucially, computer models— particularly a model developed by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts— foresaw the westward turn that Sandy took after moving parallel to the East Coast. That left hook brought the storm into the Mid-Atlantic states at a perpendicular angle, which put areas along and to the north of the storm’s center — all of New Jersey north of Atlantic City as well as southeastern New England — in the area of the strongest winds and highest seas, thereby maximizing the storm surge there. As researchers have since shown, Sandy’s track was likely unprecedented compared to the historical records of tropical storms and hurricanes in the region. The storm clearly demonstrated the value of weather monitoring and forecasting technology, and the need to continue to invest in both, which has been an uphill fight on Capitol Hill, given the recent emphasis on budget cuts. “I think Sandy helped with identifying for the public how crucial a national federal infrastructure is for these scale events,” said Marshall Shepherd, a meteorology professor at the University of Georgia and the current president of the American Meteorological Society. “Sandy was not owned by one jurisdiction and required a coordinated federal response.” NOAA officials have repeatedly cited Sandy in their lobbying push for continued funding for the next-generation of polar-orbiting satellites, telling Congress and the public that forecasts would be far less accurate if just one satellite were to go dark. Lesson 3: Learn from Communications Failures While forecasters succeeded in accurately predicting the path and impacts of the storm, there were flaws in how the threat was communicated to the public. For starters, there were no hurricane watches or warnings issued north of the North Carolina coastline, since the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., feared that confusion might result if they were to issue such warnings only to drop them once the storm transitioned from a purely tropical one to a “post-tropical” storm system, which it did on Oct. 29, 2012, shortly before landfall. In such a scenario, the public might wrongly think the danger had passed, NOAA officials said. A computer model projection made on Oct. 28, for sea level pressure and winds a few thousand feet above the surface on Oct. 30, as Hurricane Sandy crosses the New Jersey coastline.

During Sandy, the National Weather Service was operating under a set of rules — since changed — that restricted their ability to leave hurricane warnings in effect after a hurricane transitions into a post-tropical storm. According to the new guidelines, drawn up in Sandy’s wake, forecasters will have the option of continuing tropical storm and hurricane warnings after a storm makes the post-tropical transition. It is not clear yet to what extent the lack of hurricane warnings played in evacuation decisions, but some have speculated that it may have contributed to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s decision to hold off on evacuation orders until just 24 hours in advance, which likely limited the number of evacuees. Another communications challenge concerned the strength of the storm. Since Hurricane Sandy was a Category 1 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale as it approached the Mid-Atlantic states, some may have dismissed it as a minor threat along the lines of Tropical Storm Irene, which hit in 2011 and caused comparatively minor damage in New Jersey and New York. The Saffir-Simpson scale does not take into account a storm’s size or its potential storm surge, making it an incomplete indicator of a storm’s damage potential. A large Category 1 or 2 storm like Sandy can cause just as much coastal devastation as a small Category 3 storm, for example. Furthermore, sea level rise means that any storm, be it a weak or major hurricane, may be more damaging than a similar storm occurring several decades ago. Discussions are underway to try to communicate a more complete spectrum of storm threats, rather than having forecasters continue to stress the category designation alone. One alternative to the Saffir-Simpson scale would provide some of the information that the public currently lacks — a measure of how a storm’s size may contribute to its damage potential. This metric, known as “Integrated Kinetic Energy” or IKE, takes a storm’s size as well as the strength of its winds into account. Hurricane Sandy was the largest hurricane on record, as measured by the diameter of its wind field. Because of its large size, it set a huge expanse of Atlantic Ocean water into motion, ultimately building seas to unprecedented heights at the entrance to New York Harbor . The Integrated Kinetic Energy calculation was more than 300 terajoules for Hurricane Sandy, which was the largest IKE measurement for any hurricane between 1990 and 2006, which makes it larger than the IKE figure for Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. “If the public was aware that this number was so high, which is an indication of the large potential for damage from storm surge and waves, some of them might have been able to make better life- and property-saving decisions,” said Vasu Misra, an associate professor of meteorology at Florida State University, in a press release. Lesson 4: Get Used to the Age of Consequences For some, Hurricane Sandy became the new poster event of global warming. While attributing certain characteristics of the storm — such as its record size — to global warming is difficult, if not impossible at this time, it is clear that global warming exacerbated the damage by helping to boost sea levels in the affected areas. Factors that contributed to the top 10 high-water events measured at New York’s Battery Park from 1900 to present. The water height for each event is shown against the benchmark of mean lower low water averaged between 1983 and 2001. Sea level rise (about a foot since 1900) is depicted as a component of storm surge. Although Sandy’s surge peaked close to high tide, other events had even higher tide levels.Click to enlarge the image.

In New York City, for example, sea level has risen by about a foot during the past century, due to both sea level rise and local land subsidence. This meant that the record surge rode atop a higher baseline water level than it would have had the storm struck a century ago. And with scientists predicting up to 3 feet of sea level rise by 2100, coastal cities around the world will face even greater threats. The coastal flooding from Sandy’s storm surge played out nearly exactly as scientists had previously warned in a series of reports commissioned by state and city governments. All of the subway tunnels connecting Brooklyn and Queens with Manhattan were flooded, as was the tunnel linking Hoboken, N.J., and Manhattan. Air travel was paralyzed, too, as all three major New York area airports experienced coastal flooding and were closed for days, along with Teterboro Airport in northern New Jersey, which is the busiest general aviation airport in the country. Hurricane Sandy fit into the extreme weather theme of 2012. The storm spun its way ashore in the midst of the hottest year on record in the U.S., when sea surface temperatures off the East Coast were also running well above average, and at the same time that one of the worst droughts since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s was turning the normally productive soil of the Midwest into dust. One of the more intriguing areas of research that could yield insights into the way climate change contributes to extreme events concerns the jet stream — the high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air that steers weather systems around the world — and the rapidly warming Arctic, where sea ice plummeted to a record low in September 2012. The shape of the jet stream that gave rise to Sandy was viewed with awe by some meteorologists, and suspicion by others. As the storm began moving north-northeast away from the Bahamas, a massive area of High pressure aloft set up shop over northeastern Canada and Greenland. This high, fittingly known as a “blocking high,” prevented Sandy from moving out to sea. At the same time, a deep dip in the jet stream began to dig southward into the Midwest, and the airflow around these two features scooped up Sandy and turned it northwestward, toward land. Some studies have tied an increase in the “blocking highs” near Greenland, as well as a sharply undulating jet stream in general, to the melting Arctic sea ice, which is one of the most visible signs of a warming planet. “Our research shows that northward swings, or ridges, in the jet stream have become more frequent in recent decades, exactly in the location where the large blocking high was parked when Sandy came along,” said Jennifer Francis, a meteorology professor at Rutgers University and one of the leading proponents of the Arctic connection hypothesis, in an email conversation. “These ridges favor the development of blocks, and they are just the type of pattern we expect to increase as the Arctic continues to warm much faster than the rest of the northern hemisphere.” Marshall Shepherd, the president of the American Meteorological Society, said his graduate students have also investigated the Greenland block that was entrenched at the time that Sandy moved out of the tropics, concluding that it was “off the charts” in terms of its strength. Andrew Kemp, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, said forthcoming research shows that sea level rise contributed to the coastal flooding from Sandy, but it was not the largest factor when compared to the timing of the high tide, the storm track, and other variables. Still, every inch counts, particularly when critical infrastructure is concerned. "The risk, of course, is when flood heights exceed the physical thresholds of coastal defenses, and infrastructure is flooded. With all things being equal, sea level rise will make that happen more often," Kemp said in an email. Regardless of whether global warming helped steer Sandy toward land, the coastal flooding it caused should have been an urgent call to action. The failure of coastal cities to implement any large-scale plans to boost climate and extreme-weather resilience in the wake of Sandy is troubling. It suggest New York, or any other coastal city, may get caught flat-footed once again.

New research shows Hurricane Sandy was the worst storm to hit New York since at least 1700 It's been four years since Hurricane (or Superstorm) Sandy made landfall, causing nearly $50 billion in damage across just New York City and New Jersey. But researchers are still only just beginning to reckon with how historic and rare a storm Sandy was. The giant, slow moving monster hung around New York City for three days, pushing water onto land. The result was levels of flooding unseen in the modern era, swamping the subway system and causing damage that still hasn't been entirely repaired. Orton's model used present sea level conditions, and didn't directly account for climate change. In the future, he said, rising seas make the risk of a Sandy-like event significantly more likely. Head researcher Philip Orton, who studies ocean physics at the Stevens Institute of Technology, collected data on past storms to create a model that estimated how often a storm like Hurricane Sandy would happen. In the process Orton showed that no hurricane, tropical storm, or northeaster had caused as much flooding in the New York City area since at least 1700. Before that date, we simply don't know what happened, Orton told Business Insider. Two hurricanes, in 1788 and 1821, probably hit New York and New Jersey as Category 3 storms. But they were smaller and faster-moving, and didn't stick around long enough to push anywhere near as much water onto land as Sandy did. While the risk of a Sandy-like flood will creep upward over time, Orton said, it's important that people understand that the risk in the next is still fairly low. More urgent is the task of preparing for more common, mid-sized floods in the area. Down the road, with rising sea levels, the threat of a Sandy-like event will grow.

Read More 32-Foot-Plus Waves From Hurricane Sandy Topple Records By Andrew Freedman Published: November 14th, 2012 , Last Updated: November 14th, 2012 Hurricane Sandy has already broken dozens of records, from the lowest air pressure reading ever recorded in the Northeast to the highest storm surge on record in Lower Manhattan. After reviewing wave height data, the National Weather Service office in Philadelphia has determined that the wave heights recorded at two buoys — including one monster 32.5-foot significant wave height at a buoy near the entrance to New York Harbor — set records for the largest waves seen in this region since such records began in 1975.

This map was produced with data from a radar scatterometer on the Indian Space Research Organization’s (ISRO) Oceansat-2. Wind speeds above 40 mph are yellow; above 50 mph are orange; and above 60 mph are dark red.Click to enlarge the image. Credit: NASA. One of the buoys is located near the entrance to New York Harbor, about 15 nautical miles southeast of Breezy Point, N.Y., which sustained heavy damage from a merciless combination of coastal flooding and a fire that spread out of control. The harbor entrance buoy recorded a significant wave height of 32.5 feet at 8:50 pm on Oct. 29, beating the previous record set during Hurricane Irene by 6.5 feet! Records at that buoy extend only to 2008, which minimizes the historical significance of the record somewhat. Significant wave height measures the average of the top third of the highest waves, which means that individual waves were actually higher than the 32.5-foot measurement. The other buoy that set a significant wave height record is located 30 nautical miles south of Islip, Long Island, and during the evening of Oct. 29, the wave heights at that location built to a maximum height of 31 feet. That was the highest seen at that location since that buoy began operation in 1975, and exceeded the previous record of 30 feet, which was set during a fierce nor'easter on Dec. 11, 1992. "BASED ON THE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED . . . IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT BOTH NATIONAL DATA BUOY LOCATIONS NEAREST SANDY HOOK . . . ACHIEVED A RECENT RECORD EXTREME SEA STATE ON TOP OF AND PROBABLY VERY CLOSE TO THE TIME OF THE RECORD STORM TIDE AT SANDY HOOK. ONE CAN INFER FROM THE DATA THAT THESE WAVE HEIGHTS WERE THE LARGEST SINCE RECORD KEEPING BEGAN IN THIS PORTION OF THE WESTERN ATLANTIC IN 1975," the Weather Service said. Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall as a post-tropical storm near Atlantic City on Oct. 30, had an extraordinarily expansive tropical storm-force wind field that extended nearly 1,000 miles from the center of the storm. That enabled it to churn the sea into a frenzy, building massive waves that battered the coastlines of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. According to Jeff Masters of Weather Underground, since 1988, only one tropical storm and no hurricane has had a larger area of tropical storm-force winds. "Most incredibly, 10 hours before landfall (9:30 am EDT October 30), the total energy of Sandy's winds of tropical storm-force and higher peaked at 329 terajoules — the highest value for any Atlantic hurricane since at least 1969. This is 2.7 times higher than Katrina's peak energy, and is equivalent to five Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs," Masters wrote on his blog. At The Battery in Lower Manhattan, the water level, driven by these strong winds, reached a record 13.88 feet above the average low tide level, which included a surge component of 9.23 feet. That set an all-time record for the location. Sandy Hook, N.J., which is a spit of land that juts into the Atlantic pointing toward New York City from the extreme northeastern part of the state, also saw record coastal flooding during Sandy. The water level there rose to 13.31 feet above the average low tide level before the gauge malfunctioned. Or to put it another way, the water level at Sandy Hook rose to 8.1 feet above the average high-tide line.

A year after being walloped by Hurricane Irene, residents rushed to put away boats, harvest crops and sandbag boardwalks Friday as the Eastern Seaboard braced for a rare megastorm that experts said would cause much greater havoc (AP Photo/The Press of Atlantic City, Dale Gerhard) RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell declared a state of emergency Friday in preparation for an anticipated super-storm that officials said will begin to be felt in much of the state on Saturday. While there’s some uncertainty of the storm’s track, the governor’s office said all forecasts call for significant impacts to Virginia over the weekend and early next week. Emergency officials said it wouldn’t take a direct hit for the state to see significant effects, calling it a “longhaul event” that could knock out power up until Election Day. HurricaneSandy, which weakened to a category 1 hurricane Thursday night in the Caribbean, is expected to blend with a winter storm to hit the East Coast. The storm already has killed more than two dozen people. Laura Southard, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, said the eastern half of the state should begin seeing rain by Saturday afternoon, with tropical storm force gusts and sustained winds in some areas up to 70 mph. Widespread power outages, downed trees and flooding are expected to follow as the storm passes Tuesday or Wednesday. “The deal with this storm is it doesn’t matter if we get a direct hit or not. It is so big and widespread and of such a nature that we could expect impacts in Virginia similar to Irene,” she said. Hurricane Irene killed five people, knocked out power to 1.1 million — the second-largest power outage in state history — and did $182 million in damage in August 2011. Southard said residents should be prepared for extended power outages and should stock up on nonperishable food, batteries, gas and other supplies. “People should be getting their supplies together and be done with their preparations by Saturday afternoon or so and be ready to hunker down,” she said. The Virginia Department of Transportation said Friday that crews stand ready across the state to respond to any unsafe traveling conditions and damage resulting from the storm. The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services also encouraged farmers to prepare for power outages, as well as structural or crop damage. And the Coast Guard also urged mariners to heed warnings and take necessary precautions. Dominion Virginia Power said Friday it is mobilizing thousands of crews, including some from other states, to deal with expected power outages. “What makes this particular event very concerning are the public safety threats to our customers and to our employees who will be out in the elements,” Dominion spokesman David Botkins said. “We’re looking at snow in parts of the state, extreme rain in other parts of the state, high winds, and so it’s got all of the various ingredients that make traveling very, very difficult. That’s why it’s so important that people prepare now.” Storms this late in the hurricane season are not unheard of. Virginia was hit by a big storm around the time three years ago, and the remnants of a tropical storm caused historic flooding in some western parts of the state on Election Day in 1985. “Hurricane season goes through the end of November,” she said. “We say it every year and here’s a good reason people should pay attention to it.”
Millions along the east coast of America woke up to scenes of destruction and no power, as Superstorm Sandy moved slowly inland after battering the coast line overnight. The New Jersey coastline was hit by winds of up to 90 miles per hour and an unprecedented 13-foot surge of seawater was hurled at New York City, flooding its tunnels, subway stations and the electrical system that powers Wall Street. Much of the Atlantic seaboard suffered from massive floods. The storm was continuing to plough westward over south central Pennsylvania, still packing near hurricane-force winds as strong as 65 miles per hour, said the National Weather Service. At least 33 people were killed across the east coast – many by falling trees – in New Jersey, New York, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, adding to the 58 who already died because of the hurricane in the Caribbean. Superstorm Sandy: the latest– Barack Obama declares a “major disaster” in New York City, New Jersey and Long Island.– Around 50 to 60 million people across the east coast are expected to be affected by the superstorm.– Over 200 patients were evacuated from New York University’s Tisch Hospital after the power went out and a backup generator failed.– The New York Stock Exchange will stay shut on Tuesday – the first time since 1888 that weather has prevented it from opening for two days.– A nuclear power plant called Oyster Creek, in New Jersey, was put on high alert due to rising water.– Sandy lost its hurricane status late on Monday night, and is now a tropical storm. President Barack Obama declared a “major disaster” in both New York and New Jersey, and an estimated 8 million people along the US east coast were hit by power outages, including two million in New York. The storm has interrupted the US presidential campaign a week before election day on 8 November, and both President Obama and Mitt Romney were forced to cancel campaign events. For the first time since 1888, the New York Stock Exchange will be closed for two consecutive days due to weather. One disaster forecasting company predicted that economic losses could ultimately reach as much as $20bn. Google map below plots videos of the storm submitted by US residents and curated by Storyful. New York a ‘ghost town’ “The worst of the weather has come and the city certainly is feeling the impacts,” said Michael Bloomberg, New York City mayor. “We have seen record surge levels, we’re seeing an extraordinary amount of water throughout lower Manhattan. There are trees down throughout the city.” He urged people to stay away from exposed power lines. Large sections of New York City were without power, and transportation in the metropolitan area was at a standstill. Residents watched whole areas of the city disappear into darkness as power was cut and the World Trade Center site was a glowing ghost near the tip of lower Manhattan. Almost everyone did heed the warnings of officials, stocked up on supplies and hunkered down. My neighbourhood, at least what I could see of it from my window while working from home, was a ghost town.Kevin Dolak, New York resident “Hitting at high tide, the strongest surge and the strongest winds all hit at the worst possible time,” said Jeffrey Tongue, a meteorologist for the weather service in Brookhaven, New York. Water poured into the subway system and tunnels under the city, raising concerns that the world’s financial capital could be out of action for days. Schools are expected to be closed for four to five days in New York City, and the city’s subway system is also suspended. New Yorkers posted pictures on twitter of flooded stations and a water-filled Ground Zero. “In my experience people were at first a bit sceptical, particularly after Hurricane Irene more or less missed the city last year,” Kevin Dolak, Brooklyn resident, told Channel 4 News. “In the end though, almost everyone did heed the warnings of officials, stocked up on supplies and hunkered down. My neighbourhood, at least what I could see of it from my window while working from home, was a ghost town.” Transport suspended “The New York city subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night,” said Joseph Lhota, MTA chairman. “Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on our entire transportation system, in every borough and county of the region. It has brought down trees, ripped out power and inundated tunnels, rail yards and bus depots.” New York City’s three major airports remained closed. Overall, more than 13,500 flights had been cancelled for Monday and Tuesday, almost all related to the storm, according to the flight-tracking service FlightAware. Tropical storm “It’s total devastation down there, there are boats in the street five blocks from the ocean,” said evacuee Peter Sandomeno, one of the owners of the Broadway Court Motel in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey. “That’s the worst storm I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been there for 11 years.” Just before the centre of the storm reached land, it was stripped of hurricane status and was reclassified as a tropical storm, but the distinction was purely technical, based on its shape and internal temperature. It still packed hurricane-force winds, and forecasters were careful to say it remained every bit as dangerous to the 50 to 60 million people in its path. In the Breezy Point areas of the New York City borough of Queens, 50 homes were burned to the ground in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Election campaigning cancelled Superstorm Sandy also devastated both the preidential candidates’ election campaign strategies, just one week before election day. Obama cancelled campaign events Monday and Tuesday as he stayed in the White House to manage the vast emergency that hit the heavily populated region between Washington and Boston and began to stretch toward Chicago and the Midwest. Mitt Romney and running mate Paul Ryan also announced they were cancelling events.
A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Sunday, October 28, 2012 Hurricane Sandy: Finish Preparations! Storm Moving Faster It is time to wrap up preparations. Sandy still looks like a major threat and she is moving a little faster than originally anticipated. Don't make this mistake, "we underestimated this one." Hurricane Sandy at 8:30am CDT with 75 mph winds and a minimum pressure of 951 mb. University of Wisconsin Coastal winds are coming up a bit faster than I expected with gusts to nearly 40 mph at Norfolk, VA and gusts in the 30's in eastern North Carolina and DelMarVa. Kitty Hawk had a gust of 45 mph recently. Additional Rainfall Because some of the storm's rain has already fallen and because it is moving a little faster than originally forecast, the amounts don't look quite as impressive as earlier forecasts. However, these are more than sufficient to cause flooding in the areas with heavier rains. click to enlarge Winds The center of Sandy should move inside the shaded blue area. Now, I have to ask you to work with me to convey the wind threat. There is no way to, in a blog, list every single city of interest. So, pick out your location and I'll walk you through the highlights. This is, more or less, the storm's current wind field (actually, it is a forecast for 2pm EDT but bear with me): So, you can compare the changes from the current winds (above) to the forecasts (below). 8am EDT Monday forecast. Note, the exact position of the storm, and the corresponding winds, could shift north or south a little. The pressure is forecast to have fallen to 944 mb, stronger than now. U.S. GFS model via WeatherBell The winds surrounding the eye are forecast to have strengthened which is what is meteorologically expected with the falling pressure. Winds are already gusting above 40 mph from DelMarVa across NYC and along the southern New England coast. 2pm EDT Monday. Pressures have fallen another 4mb. Red winds = strong enough to cause power failures. Winds will be gusting above 50 mph from, roughly Washington, DC to NJ to Boston and southern New Hampshire. Very dangerous winds with gusts above 70 ph will be reaching Long Island (keep in mind the pattern may shift a little north or south). 8pm EDT Monday. Landfall in New Jersey Monday evening. Note that winds capable of causing power failures extend from Portland to Norfolk. Winds are coming up in the eastern Great Lakes. Dangerous winds are occurring in the D.C.-Baltimore area. Winds are relatively calm (temporarily!) near the eye. 2am EDT Tuesday The eye is in the general vicinity of Harrisburg. Strong winds are still occurring from D.C. up toward Hagerstown and over the eastern Great Lakes and southwest Ontario. There are other strong winds along the St. Laurence Valley. There will be a major storm surge. This map does not include the +2' astronomical tide (full moon) and wave action of 20' or more. So, preparations should be rushed to completion throughout this region. This storm is not weakening and will be as bad as I have feared.Snow/Blizzard The blue areas are under winter storm watches for high winds and heavy snow. Is It Hype? All weekend, even at the wedding reception last night, I've been asked if meteorologists are "hyping" this storm. Let me give you some metrics so you can compare what I am expecting so you can judge for yourself: $20 billion or more in damage Two million or more "customers" (individual homes and businesses) without power At least one land-based (as opposed to a ship over water) wind gust of 75 mph or higher So, there it is as best as I can lay it out. Hunker down in a sturdy building with some good books, board games, and look on it as one of life's adventures. Be prepared for an extended period of inconvenience. Try to have a good attitude -- you'll be able to bore your grandchildren with stories about the Great Storm of '12!
Hurricane Sandy: After Landfall Last night, Hurricane Sandy -- the largest Atlantic tropical system on record -- made landfall just south of Atlantic City, New Jersey, bringing winds up to 90 mph (150 kph), and pushing a massive storm surge onto beaches and shorelines. At least 12 deaths have been reported in the United States. These fatalities, when added to the previous toll in the Caribbean, leave Sandy responsible for more taking more than 80 lives to date. Millions across the Eastern Seaboard are now without power, and even more are struggling with rising floodwater. Sandy continues northward, now downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, and those affected are now assessing the damage. Collected here are images of Sandy's aftermath, many from New York City, which suffered widespread blackouts and a record-setting high tide early this morning.

Tag: Tropical Storm Sandy Hurricane Sandy over the Northwestern Bahamas with 80mph winds, the cloud pattern shows a highly sheared storm – and one that is transitioning to something more of a hybrid between tropical and extra-tropical. GOES-14 high resolution 1-minute rapid scan satellite imagery. around 12pm October 26th 2012. Hurricane Sandy has been blasting through the Bahamas with some of the Central and Northwestern islands seeing a direct hit from Sandy and hurricane conditions as a result. Overnight, high southerly and south-southwesterly wind shear commenced over the center of Sandy. This has disrupted the core structure of the hurricane and injected dry air near the center – starting its transition into a more extra-tropical structure. Meanwhile, the cleanup begins in the Caribbean islands already affected and, unfortunately, reports of death and destruction have come in from Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In total, more than 20 people have reportedly died as a result of the storm. Forecast Track… Sandy made the turn to the Northwest yesterday that had it skirt the northern Bahamas delivering hurricane conditions there. This morning, its forward speed has slowed and it has turned back to the North. Tonight, Sandy should turn more to the northeast and pick up speed in response to an approaching trough currently over the Mississippi valley. By Monday, Sandy is expected to be at the latitude of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the trough has since stalled over the interior Northeast and a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along it. This wave of low pressure will turn Sandy back to the northwest, towards the Mid-Atlantic/New England coast for a potential landfall Wednesday morning. Sandy will not be fully tropical by this time, so it will have a broad wind field and the exact location of landfall becomes less important as effects spread over three hundred miles from that point. Official National Hurricane Center Hurricane Sandy track as of 11am Eastern time October 26th 2012. Forecast Impacts… The Bahamas…Hurricane conditions will subside in the northernmost islands of the Bahamas this afternoon, and tropical storm conditions should subside by Saturday afternoon. Storm surges of 3-5feet are occurring in areas of onshore winds while rainfall totals of 1-4″ are expected. Winds have likely reached near 80mph on eastern parts of Grand Bahama island and most of Little Abaco. Hurricane warnings are in effect for these islands and tropical storm warnings are in effect for the rest of the Northwest Bahamas. Florida…Tropical storm warnings are in effect along much of the East coast of Florida. Tropical storm conditions are occurring along the immediate coast in parts of Florida along with squally showers associated with Sandy. These winds are kicking up very high surf and are generating storm surges of about 1-3ft. Rainfall totals here should be around 2″. Tropical storm conditions should subside from south to north along the East Coast of Florida today and tomorrow as Sandy moves northwards and north-northeastwards. Bermuda… Tropical Storm conditions are possible on Sunday here as the wind field of this cyclone expands. A tropical storm watch is in effect as a result. Squally showers with (near) tropical storm conditions and large southwesterly swells are to be expected to start the work week here. The fact that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda and along the US East coast simultaneously suggests a storm more than 600miles in diameter. US East Coast… *Saturday morning – Monday morning: South Carolina and North Carolina (to Wilmington) will see offshore winds as Sandy passes well to the east this weekend. Tropical Storm conditions are possible mainly in the offshore marine areas here, but unlikely on land. Some showers may develop to produce some gusty winds however. Tropical storm watches are in effect along the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. There may be an area of onshore winds in the Outer Banks for a time that could produce some coastal flooding, and sound-side flooding will remain a threat for much of the storm’s passage. *Monday morning – Wednesday night: Outer Banks, NC northwards to Maine: Sandy is expected to make landfall in Southern New Jersey, near the mouth of Delaware Bay according to the National Hurricane Center’s most recent forecast. The entire New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts coasts could see: tropical storm conditions with hurricane force gusts possible, heavy rain that may lead to some inland flooding, and severe coastal flooding from a large storm tide. Meanwhile, areas inland and to the south may still see tropical storm force winds (or at least gusts to that strength), heavy potentially flooding rains, and even some snow farther inland; this could extend as far inland as Ontario and Quebec. Off shore winds, to the south of Sandy, may allow for hazardously low water levels, or coastal flooding from an unusual direction in Chesapeake Bay and the Outer Banks. Specifics of this forecast will be refined as the storm gets closer. Pay attention to emergency management messages and products/warnings from local and regional officials. GOES RGB Imagery of Tropical Storm Sandy south of Jamaica in the Central Caribbean. According to the National Hurricane Center, as of 11am EST October 23rd, Sandy had top sustained winds of 50mph and a minimum pressure of 993mb. The storm was headed north-northeast at 5mph. Last night, Tropical Depression 18 strengthened into Tropical Storm Sandy in the Central Caribbean. Sandy has continued to slowly strengthen this morning and is expected to become a hurricane in the next 48 hours. Steering currents around Sandy are currently very weak and the storm is only moving very slowly northwards towards Jamaica. As land is implicated, there are tropical cyclone advisories in effect: Tropical Storm conditions are likely in Jamaica in the next 36-48hours while hurricane conditions are possible somewhere in Jamaica as the center of Sandy comes onshore. However, the biggest threat for now appears to be heavy rainfall that could lead to life threatening flash flooding and mudslides in Jamaica, Haiti, and Eastern Cuba. Forecast track… Despite the currently weak steering currents, there is incredible model agreement on the track for the next three days – a northward drift that accelerates to a normal pace, taking Sandy over Jamaica, and Eastern Cuba and exiting the Caribbean into the Central Bahamas. After that point some forecast models have Sandy being picked up and taken out to sea by a trough descending from Newfoundland, possibly affecting Bermuda, while others have Sandy merging into a trough over the US East Coast, producing a potentially disastrous coastal storm with a heavy snow event inland. It is hard to discredit either solution because they both have support from our most reliable models. The National Hurricane Center’s forecast doesn’t extend that far into the future but it appears they prefer the forecast that has Sandy going out to sea. Keep in mind that the future track is very uncertain and Sandy should be monitored closely. Forecast Intensity… Sandy should continue to slowly organize and strengthen today as it is embedded in a very moist environment with apparently favorable atmospheric winds. However, Hurricane Hunters observed that the storm is tilted vertically and this will inhibit rapid intensification in the short term. If Sandy manages to align itself vertically, the storm has a better chance of strengthening at a more substantial pace. Regardless, Sandy should be a hurricane before crossing Jamaica. It is expected to then weaken to a tropical storm during the passage and stay at a reduced strength for its Cuba landfall.
Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation How Hurricane Sandy Slapped the Sarcasm Out of Twitter People congregate on Tuesday in front of a building in Manhattan that still has wireless Internet access.Credit Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Twitter is often a caldron of sarcasm, much of it funny, little of it useful. But as a social medium based on short-burst communication, Twitter can change during large events — users talk about “watching” the spectacle unfold across their screens. It is, after all, a real-time service, which means that you can “see” what is happening as it happens. As a media reporter, my Twitter feed has a strong Manhattan bias, serving as a sandbox for media and technology types that I follow. Under normal circumstances, we show up on Twitter to preen, self-promote and crack wise about the latest celebrity scene. If that New York cohort has a soul — insert your own joke here — you could see into it on Twitter. And then along came Hurricane Sandy. For most of Monday, people on Twitter were watching an endless loop of hurricane coverage on television and having some fun with it, which is the same thing that happens when the Grammys or the Super Bowl is on. But as the storm bore down, Twitter got busy and very, very serious. It is hard to data-mine the torrent – some estimates suggested there were three and a half million tweets with the hashtag #Sandy — but my feed quickly moved from the prankish to the practical in a matter of hours as landfall approached. I asked Simon Dumenco, who writes the Media Guy column for Advertising Age and is well versed in the dark arts of Twitter analytics, about the tonal shift via e-mail. “I kept a close eye on the Top 10 Trends chart as Sandy was bearing down on the East Coast, and there was no shortage of gravitas on Twitter,” he wrote. “The last time I checked before losing power in my Manhattan apartment, seven of the 10 trends were Sandy-related — New Jersey, ConEd, Hudson River, Lower Manhattan, FEMA, Queens and #SandyRI. Clicking on each of them yielded plenty of information.” At my home in suburban New Jersey, a 30-foot limb dropped down at 4 p.m., so the illusion that this was an event happening to someone else quickly dissipated. And at 8 p.m., just when we hunkered down in front of the big screen, the house went dark. This very large event would not be televised. We built a fire and sat around a hand-cranked radio, but I was diverted over and over by the little campfire of Twitter posts on my smartphone. It was hard to resist. Twitter not only keeps you in the data stream, but because you can contribute and re-tweet, you feel as if you are adding something even though Mother Nature clearly has the upper hand. The activity of it, the sharing aspect, the feeling that everyone is in the boat and rowing, is far different from consuming mass media. Because my Internet connection was poor, so much of the rich media — amazing videos and pictures documenting the devastation — was lost to me. In true media throwback fashion, Hurricane Sandy was something I experienced as a text event, but I don’t feel as if I missed much. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel inundation, the swamping of the Lower East Side, the huge problems at New York hospitals, the stranding of the holdouts in Atlantic City, all became apparent on Twitter in vivid detail. At the same time, much of the seen-it-all and isn’t-it-dumb seemed to leak out of my Twitter stream. (The message that earnestness was nascent and irony was on the run seemed widespread — the servers of Gawker, the hilarious and ill-mannered Manhattan snark machine, were drowned and the site went down. Still is, as a matter of fact.) Many local television stations did an amazing job and the big cable news outlets played large, but the template of the rain-and-wind-lashed correspondent shouting to a blow-dried anchor back in the studio has its limits. The local radio stations were nimble and careful, including WCBS, WNYC and WINS, but they were part of the story on occasion, with transformers going down and hurricane-induced malfunctions along the way. Manhattan is the epicenter of a number of big blogs, including Gawker, BuzzFeed and Huffington Post, but each had to pivot to Twitter, among other platforms, as their servers succumbed to encroaching waters. (At a conference last year, Andrew Fitzgerald of Twitter wondered about the utility of the platform if the end of the world arrived in the form of an alien attack. The people participating in the discussion pointed out that the lightweight infrastructure of Twitter and its durability would probably make it very practical should end times draw nigh.) In the early days of Twitter, there was a very big debate about whether reporters should break news on Twitter. That debate now seems quaint. Plenty of short-burst nuggets of news went out from reporters on Twitter on Monday night and they were quickly followed by more developed reports on-air or on the Web. There were abundant news posts from @antderosa of Reuters, @acarvin of NPR and @brianstelter of The New York Times, among many others, but there were also tweets from ordinary people relaying very important information about their blocks, their neighborhoods, their boroughs. I knew what was happening to many of my friends as far away as the District of Columbia and as close as the guy up the block. There is no more important news than that. Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University, wrote in a note: “To me the most basic act of journalism there can be is: ‘I’m there, you’re not, let me tell you about it.’ Or: ‘I heard it, you didn’t, let me tell you what Bloomberg said.’ And the fact is Twitter is rife with such. That is why it is basic in a sprawling emergency.” Twitter is a global platform, but it can be relentlessly and remarkably local should the occasion — or crisis — arise, as Choire Sicha, the founder of The Awl, pointed out. “Twitter was phenomenally useful microscopically — I was literally finding out information about how much flooding the Zone A block next to me was having, hour by hour — and macroscopically, too — I didn’t even have to turn on the TV once the whole storm,” he wrote. He pointed out, as have many others, that there was abundant misinformation rendered in 140 characters as well, which reminded @kbalfe of another rapid-fire medium, actually. “Was a lot like cable news: indispensable … yet full of errors.” In fact, some people used the friction-free, democratic nature of the medium to intentionally stir panic. On Tuesday, BuzzFeed identified — “doxed” in the nomenclature of the Web — a person they said they said was the guy behind @comfortablysmug, an account that suggested that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had been trapped by rising waters, that Con Edison was shutting down all of Manhattan and that the floor of the New York Stock Exchange had been flooded. BuzzFeed identified the person behind those tweets as Shashank Tripathi, a hedge fund analyst and the campaign manager of Christopher R. Wight, this year’s Republican candidate to represent New York’s 12th Congressional District. (Mr. Tripathi has since apologized and resigned from the campaign.) Because his Twitter feed was followed by a number of New York-based reporters, the misinformation spread quickly, although John Herrman, also writing in BuzzFeed, suggested that “Twitter is a Truth Machine,” writing that “during Sandy, the Internet spread — then crushed — rumors at breakneck speed.” Margaret Sullivan, the public editor of The New York Times, said in a message on Twitter that whatever the quality of the feed at any given moment, it was riveting: “Impossible to tear one’s eyes from, with occasional nuggets of helpfulness amid constant stream of flotsam and jetsam.” The day after the storm, Twitter shook off much of the earnestness and reverted back to its snippy self, although the storm’s death toll and the quest for resources made it a more serious village common than usual. In an e-mail, Peter Kafka of AllThings D, considered the value of Twitter in a big news event by running it through the way-back machine. “Would it have been better during 9/11 if we had Twitter?” he wrote. “Plenty of bad and good info spread that day, by mouth, web and TV. My hunch is Twitter would do the same. The difference? Twitter allows my friends/like-minded people/people I like to feel a bit more connected. And that’s a lot better than less connected.” Calling it a “pop-up town square” for the affected area, @editorialiste said in a message on Twitter, it was “a great place to laugh, cry, argue, sympathize together.” Kurt Andersen, radio host and writer, said that the combination of utility and sociability made Twitter a remarkable informative shelter during the storm. “I’ve never liked or used the word ‘community’ about people communicating online, but the Sandy conversations seemed worthy of the word, actually communal,” he wrote. “And given the circumstances, it really could’ve only happened online.”

Superstorm Sandy breaks records Sandy's strength, indicated by barometric pressure, set a record for Northeast storms New York Harbor saw a record level 32.5-foot wave Sandy cut power to a record number of people in the Northeastern United States Sandy is not expected to come near Katrina's record $108 billion in damages (CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy, which New York Mayor Bloomberg called "a storm of unprecedented proportions," will likely not set records for most costly or most deadly. Still, the mayor tweeted Tuesday that Sandy is "maybe the worst #NYC has ever experienced." The hurricane-turned-cyclone can claim several historical titles. Sandy's strength, as indicated by barometric pressure just before landfall, set a record. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. When hurricane hunter aircraft measured its central pressure at 940 millibars -- 27.76 inches -- Monday afternoon, it was the lowest barometric reading ever recorded for an Atlantic storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The previous record holder was the 1938 "Long Island Express" Hurricane, which dropped as low as 946 millibars.

Hurricane Sandy images Superstorm Sandy batters boats Sandy's strength and angle of approach combined to produce a record storm surge of water into New York City. The surge level at Battery Park topped 13.88 feet at 9:24 p.m. Monday, surpassing the 10.02 feet record water level set by Hurricane Donna in 1960. New York Harbor's surf also reached a record level when a buoy measured a 32.5-foot wave Monday. That wave was 6.5 feet taller than a 25-foot wave churned up by Hurricane Irene in 2011. As Sandy approached the Northeast, forecasters were fond of pointing out that if the hurricane were a country, the area it covered would make it the 20th largest in the world -- roughly twice the size of Texas. But with tropical-force winds reaching out 580 miles, Sandy still was just the second-largest Atlantic storm on record. Hurricane Olga, another late-in-the-year storm, set the record in 2001, with tropical-force winds extending 600 miles, according to the National Hurricane Center. Sandy's power cut electricity service to a record number of people in the Northeastern United States, according to utility company numbers. There were 7.5 million businesses and households without electric power in 15 states and the District of Columbia by late Tuesday morning, according to numbers compiled by CNN from local power providers. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said 2.4 million households in his state were in the dark Tuesday, twice the number left powerless in Hurricane Irene's wake last year. "This is the largest storm-related outage in our history," John Miksad, Con Edison senior vice president for electric operations, said in a company Twitter message Tuesday. Sandy is not expected to come near the $108 billion in damages the National Hurricane Center estimated was done to the Gulf Coast states by Katrina in 2005. With new ways for people to experience and share the storm available, new measures of impact are rising. For example, the smartphone photo-sharing app Instagram registered a record number of image uploads Monday "at a rate of nearly 10 each second -- with the hashtags #hurricanesandy, #sandy and #frankenstorm," the company said. A mother learns that her newborn is part of a hospital evacuation. Facebook posts from a member of the HMS Bounty turn ominous. A man worries about the wind and rain, but another force of nature hits home. Ashley Murray became the first female president of Liberty Industrial Gases and Welding Supplies Inc. in Brooklyn. But now the family history Murray was charged with preserving is at risk of ending after Superstorm Sandy. The adage says "a picture is worth a thousand words," but when Leeann Lewandowski happened upon a photograph of her late mother on Facebook after her home was destroyed in Superstorm Sandy, she was speechless.

"I just don't feel like it," Morro told The Star-Ledger, as streams of water began appearing outside her home. "I think we're going to get mostly wind."

"It is absolutely fitting that the Daily News, New York's hometown newspaper, should be helping the victims of this awful tragedy," said Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and publisher of the paper. "We will do all we can to bring some comfort and aid to all those families who have suffered and lost so much." James Keivom/New York Daily News People came to pick up donated supplies at a Midland Beach Hurricane Sandy aid distribution center on Saturday in Staten Island. The News’ donation to the Hurricane Sandy Relief Fund was quickly followed by a $5,000 cash infusion from the head honcho at Modell’s Sporting Goods.“I applaud the Daily News for always doing the right thing for the community,” said Mitch Modell, CEO of Modell’s Sporting Goods. “We are honored to join in on the efforts to get the city recovering as soon as possible so that people can get back to their normal lives,” Modell said. He is asking readers to bring new and used outerwear to Modell’s stores in the five boroughs, except the ones closed by power outages. The pending cold snap, with temperatures expected to drop to near freezing this week, makes these donations especially critical.

In addition, Modell said he will ask customers to contribute to the relief effort, and all 112 Modell stores in the five boroughs will have dropoff sites for donated clothing. The Applebee’s restaurant chain is also pitching in. “Applebee’s is proud to join with the Daily News in the relief effort for those who were affected by the tragedy of this storm,” said Zane Tankel, chairman and CEO of Applebee’s. The News is also partnering with City Harvest, which will be collecting and distributing nonperishable food donated by readers at police stations, firehouses and municipal credit union branches throughout the five boroughs.

We thank the Daily News for its continued support and encourage fellow New Yorkers to help us fill City Harvest trucks to bring much-needed food to our neighbors.” The News launched a similar drive after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast, raising $5 million. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who spent much of Saturday inspecting damage in the Rockaways, Broad Channel and Breezy Point with State Sen. Malcolm Smith and Rep. Gregory Meeks, said hundreds of New Yorkers are in desperate need of help. Jeanne Noonan for New York Daily News Beach 101 luxury condos had the boardwalk fly off its pilings and crash into the front of their homes. “It’s horrible,” she told The News while walking through hard-hit Belle Harbor. “Some people have lost everything.” Many have been living without heat or electricity since the storm struck Monday – and have no idea when they will be getting either back. “I’m worried that a week is too long, with a nor’easter coming next week and the temperatures dropping,” she said. “I’m worried about the seniors and homebound who have no place else to go.” While there, Gillibrand met 64-year-old retired teacher Martha Militano, who escaped from her home on Beach 130th St. with only her wallet — and was left with ashes in the spot where her house once stood. Anthony DelMundo for New York Daily News Martha Militano cries as she tries to salvage some of her belongings from her charred home on Beach 130th St. and Newport Ave. in Belle Harbor on Saturday. “I’m just devastated,” Militano said, adding she is staying with one of her sons in Marine Park, Brooklyn. “It’s surreal. I still see my house in my mind.” What do desperate New Yorkers need? Walter Kozak, an MTA mechanic out on Broad Channel, summed it up in one word: “Everything.” “We lost pretty much everything I had,” said Kozak, 49, whose home of 22 years was wrecked. “Washing machine, refrigerator. ...” Tracy Arnemann, 41, who lives nearby, lost her entire kitchen. had an even longer list. “I lost everything in my house,” she said, including the television, the computers, all the furniture and her entire kitchen. “We need heat. We need gas,” she said. “It’s cold. We need a house to live in.” David Handschuh/New York Daily News Helicopter views of Breezy Point, Queens where more than 100 homes were destroyed by a raging fire during Hurricane Sandy on Rockaway, Queens. “There are thousands of people who could use even a little bit for a night’s hotel room or a month’s rent,” said Edwin, 47, of the Tottenville section. Another Staten Island survivor, Tatyana Vasilyeva, said, “That’s so sweet.” She lost her home in the storm. “It sounds awesome,” her mother, Yelena Koltsova, said, and burst into tears. “This was all they had. Now there is nothing. We would appreciate any help.” csiemaszko@nydailynews.com HOW YOU CAN HELP What you can do to boost the Daily News Sandy disaster relief fund.

(AP Photo/Dylan Patrick) MANDATORY CREDIT: DYLAN PATRICK NEW YORK (AP) — Superstorm Sandy slammed into the New Jersey coastline with 80 mph winds Monday night and hurled an unprecedented 13-foot surge of seawater at New York City, flooding its tunnels, subway stations and the electrical system that powers Wall Street. At least 16 U.S. deaths were blamed on the storm, which brought the presidential campaign to a halt a week before Election Day. For New York City at least, Sandy was not the dayslong onslaught many had feared, and the wind and rain that sent water sloshing into Manhattan from three sides began dying down within hours. Still, the power was out for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and an estimated 6.2 million people altogether across the East. The full extent of the storm's damage across the region was unclear, and unlikely to be known until daybreak. Stock trading will be closed in the U.S. for a second day Tuesday — the first time the New York Stock Exchange will be closed for two consecutive days due to weather since 1888, when a blizzard struck the city. Heavy rain and further flooding remain major threats for the next couple of days as the storm makes its way into Pennsylvania and up into New York State. The center of the storm was just outside Philadelphia near midnight, and its winds were down to 75 mph, just barely hurricane strength. "It was nerve-racking for a while, before the storm hit. Everything was rattling," said Don Schweikert, who owns a bed-and-breakfast in Cape May, N.J., near where Sandy roared ashore. "I don't see anything wrong, but I won't see everything until morning." As the storm closed in, it converged with a cold-weather system that turned it into a superstorm, a monstrous hybrid consisting not only of rain and high wind but snow in West Virginia and other mountainous areas inland. It smacked the boarded-up big cities of the Northeast corridor — Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston — with stinging rain and gusts of more than 85 mph. Just before Sandy reached land, forecasters stripped it of hurricane status, but the distinction was purely technical, based on its shape and internal temperature. It still packed hurricane-force wind, and forecasters were careful to say it was still dangerous to the tens of millions in its path. Sandy made landfall at 8 p.m. near Atlantic City, which was already mostly under water and saw an old, 50-foot piece of its world-famous Boardwalk washed away earlier in the day. Authorities reported a record surge 13 feet high at the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan, from the storm and high tide combined. In an attempt to lessen damage from saltwater to the subway system and the electrical network beneath the city's financial district, New York City's main utility cut power to about 6,500 customers in lower Manhattan. But a far wider swath of the city was hit with blackouts caused by flooding and transformer explosions. About 670,000 customers were without power late Monday in the city and suburban Westchester County. "This will be one for the record books," said John Miksad, senior vice president for electric operations at ConEdison. "This will be the largest storm-related outage in our history." New York's transit agency said water surged into two major commuter tunnels, the Queens Midtown and the Brooklyn-Battery, and it cut power to some subway tunnels in lower Manhattan after water flowed into the stations and onto the tracks. The subway system was shut down Sunday night, and the stock markets never opened Monday and are likely to be closed Tuesday as well. Schools were closed and Broadway theaters were dark. "We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. "This is a once-in-a-long-time storm." More than 200 patients — including 20 infants from neonatal intensive care — were moved from New York University's Tisch Hospital after its power went out and a backup generator failed. The patients, some on respirators operating on battery power, were taken to other hospitals. A construction crane atop a luxury high-rise collapsed in the high winds and dangled precariously 74 floors above the street. Forecasters said the wind at the top the building may have been close to 95 mph. The facade of a four-story building in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood crumbled and collapsed, leaving the lights, couches, cabinets and desks inside visible from the street. No one was hurt. As the storm approached the Northeast over the weekend, airlines canceled more than 12,000 flights in the region. Storm damage was projected at $10 billion to $20 billion, meaning it could prove to be one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. Sixteen deaths were reported in New Jersey, New York, Maryland, North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Some of the victims were killed by falling trees. At least one death was blamed on the storm in Canada. President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney canceled their campaign appearances at the very height of the race, with just over a week to go before Election Day. The president pledged the government's help and made a direct plea from the White House to those in the storm's path. "When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate," he said. "Don't delay, don't pause, don't question the instructions that are being given, because this is a powerful storm." Sandy, which killed 69 people in the Caribbean before making its way up the Atlantic, began to hook left at midday toward the New Jersey coast. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said people were stranded in Atlantic City, which sits on a barrier island. He accused the mayor of allowing them to stay there. With the hurricane roaring through, Christie warned it was no longer safe for rescuers, and advised people who didn't evacuate the coast to "hunker down" until morning. While the hurricane's 90 mph winds registered as only a Category 1 on a scale of five, it packed "astoundingly low" barometric pressure, giving it terrific energy to push water inland, said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of meteorology at MIT. And the New York metropolitan area apparently got the worst of it, because it was on the dangerous northeastern wall of the storm. "We are looking at the highest storm surges ever recorded" in the Northeast, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director for Weather Underground, a private forecasting service. "The energy of the storm surge is off the charts, basically." Hours before landfall, there was graphic evidence of the storm's power. Off North Carolina, a replica of the 18th-century sailing ship HMS Bounty that was built for the 1962 Marlon Brando movie "Mutiny on the Bounty" went down in the storm, and 14 crew members were rescued by helicopter from rubber lifeboats bobbing in 18-foot seas. Another crew member was found hours afterward but was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The captain was missing. At Cape May, water sloshed over the seawall, and it punched through dunes in other seaside communities. "When I think about how much water is already in the streets, and how much more is going to come with high tide tonight, this is going to be devastating," said Bob McDevitt, president of the main Atlantic City casino workers union. "I think this is going to be a really bad situation tonight." In Maryland, at least 100 feet of a fishing pier at the beach resort of Ocean City was destroyed. At least half a million people along the East Coast had been ordered to evacuate, including 375,000 from low-lying parts of New York City. Sheila Gladden left her home in Philadelphia's flood-prone Eastwick neighborhood, which took on 5½ feet of water during Hurricane Floyd in 1999, and headed for a hotel. "I'm not going through this again," she said. Those who stayed behind had few ways to get out. Not only was the New York subway shut down, but the Holland Tunnel connecting New York to New Jersey was closed, as was a tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Brooklyn Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and several other spans were closed because of high winds.
disaster Hurricane Sandy Overview Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. Sandy was the deadliest hurricane to hit the Northeast in 40 years, and damage estimates have placed the cost at upwards of $68 billion. Only Hurricane Katrina cost more. Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic from Haiti and Jamaica and north into Canada. More than 200 deaths were attributed to the storm, with 146 of those in the United States and 98 in the Caribbean. NGOs remain on the ground helping people to rebuild their lives and local and federal jurisdictions are working to rebuild — and affect policy changes — to prevent such devastation from bring repeated. About $60.4 billion in federal aid has been provided to storm-affected areas. Background The 10th named storm of the 2012 hurricane season, Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic, with deaths extending from Haiti and Jamaica to Canada. While still out in the ocean, it affected North Carolina coastal areas, causing storm surges and flooding on barrier islands. As the storm came ashore in New Jersey, it was so massive that the effects were felt as far south as the mountains of Tennessee and West Virginia, and as far west as Lake Michigan. More than 200 deaths have since been attributed to the storm, with most of those in the United States. Sandy raised key questions about building in coastal areas, along with concerns and discussion about future storms. New York officials revived talk of a storm surge barrier to protect the city. The storm also recharged the issue of those who refuse mandatory evacuation orders, choosing to shelter in place instead. Hurricane Irene, which struck essentially the same area in 2011 without causing as much damage as feared, only complicated the issue of evacuation “need.” In Haiti, where residents continue to struggle to rebuild from the 2010 earthquake, the floods that followed the hurricane severely affected food security. The United Nations anticipates more than 1.5 million people at risk of food insecurity in 2013 due to the damage caused by Sandy. Cholera, which had broken out post-earthquake, was a continuing concern. In Cuba, news of the devastation was slow to arrive, though 20 percent of the population was affected. It took a full two weeks for the first aid to arrive, a 40-ton shipment from the United Nations. Another 40 tons quickly followed. U.S. Impact The hurricane made landfall in New York and New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, colliding with winter weather systems already present and creating a “perfect storm.” Widespread impact included destructive winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge flooding, and even heavy, wet snow. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide. At the height of the storm, more than 7.5 million people were without power. Power outages continued for weeks after the hurricane made landfall, yet many residents remained in their homes. In New England, Hurricane Sandy was complicated when a Nor’Easter blew in a few days later, bringing another blast of cold air and high storm surges to the area. West Virginia and Tennessee received nearly three feet of snow as a result of the storm. CDP Insights Insights from Dr. Irwin Redlener on Lessons from Hurricane Sandy: Dr. Irwin Redlener, Director, National Center for Disaster Preparedness, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University and Co-Chair, NYS Ready Commission and Center for Disaster Philanthropy Advisory Council Member outlines lessons in five key areas: evacuations, citizen preparedness, vulnerable populations, incident command and coordination, mental health, training, and recovery. Read his full analysis provided to Philanthropy New York. Insights from the CDP Advisory Council on Hurricane Sandy: While thousands of NGOs and volunteers rushed to offer much-needed immediate relief to communities and people impacted by Hurricane Sandy, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy estimated it would take years to fully rebuild communities in the United States and even longer in the Caribbean. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Advisory Council — experts from academia, the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors — offer their insights on long-term recovery needs and opportunities for donors. Donors While immediate relief dollars went to housing, food and clothing, the CDP Hurricane Sandy Disaster Fund was established to invest in long-term projects that fill gaps where public resources are unavailable or scarce. We requested grant applications from NGOs committed to projects that cross broad disciplines to ease the transition from disaster to normalcy; foster collaboration among donors; use existing local philanthropic networks and a work to strengthen local philanthropy; promote cross-sector coordination with academics, donors, think tanks, and public and private humanitarian actors; and support innovative research that informs policy and strengthens future disaster preparation and response. NGO Response AidMatrix worked to get the needs of impacted communities captured and listed on The National Donations Management Network. All Hands had two superstorm Sandy response efforts: Project Staten Island and Project Long Island. They housed staff and team leaders within the impacted areas, and coordinated efforts of volunteers to aid residents by removing debris (mucking) and removing affected walls/floors (gutting. American Red Cross worked both immediately and long-term to help those affected by the storm. Red Cross workers met with families to get them financial assistance to help with security and utility deposits, home repairs and rent, as well as link them to available social service programs. In addition, the Red Cross gave grants to a number of nonprofits working in New Jersey and New York to help people with home repairs, mold remediation, food and financial assistance, and to support the work of community. AmeriCares provided more than $6.5 million in aid, benefiting more than 450,000 people, including $3.5 million in medicines and relief supplies to hard-hit communities. AmeriCares also provided $3.0 million in funding to organizations ASPCA staff and responders provided immediate relief to families affected by flooding and power outages. Responders delivered supplies, crates and food to evacuation centers, where hundreds of animals were housed, in the five boroughs. After the storm, the ASPCA worked to ensure that animal shelters in some of the hardest-hit areas had the resources necessary to stay in operation. Through an emergency grant program, the ASPCA provided over 40 grants totaling over $350,000 to organizations responding to, or impacted by, Hurricane Sandy. The Coalition for the Homeless worked to repair damage to shelters in the New York area. Before the hurricane, 47,000 people were staying in homeless shelters, a 20 percent increase from 2011. Many of the homeless shelters were evacuated and some that offered specialty services, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and youths, were left without heat, while at least one encountered significant flooding. CERF (Craft Emergency Relief Fund + Artists’ Emergency Resources) offered emergency relief to craft artists and emergency resources that benefited all artists. In response to the storm, the organization launched the CERF+ Artists’ Relief Exchange in which artists can post needs and those with things or services to offer to artists can make them available. In addition, it offered grants up to $3,000 and no interest loans for craft artists who have had career-threatening emergencies. Church World Service shipped $480,000 worth of blankets, hygiene kits, baby care, emergency cleanup kits, and school kits to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It also launched a $100,000 appeal to provide relief in Haiti and Cuba. Catholic Charities USA worked with its local agencies to assess needs that Hurricane Sandy created in communities and provided immediate services. It estimated that 50 of its local agencies provided direct relief. In the months following Hurricane Sandy, Catholic Charities USA distributed approximately $2.75 million worth of grants and in-kind donations to Catholic Charities agencies affected by Hurricane Sandy. CCUSA has also pledged to provide additional services in the form of long-term recovery grants totaling roughly $5 million for disbursement over the next five years. Collegiate Church Corporation designated $200,000 to Hurricane Sandy relief. The organization’s five ministries are engaged in hands-on recovery work in Staten Island, the Rockaways, the New Jersey shore and the East Village. They distributed food and supplies and helped with clean up and rebuilding efforts. Episcopal Relief and Development remained in contact with key diocesan staff to gather information about where damage had occurred and what the most pressing needs were. Many Episcopal congregations launched into action, expanding their feeding ministries, providing basic supplies and gas cards, and hosting community agencies that connected people to services and federal disaster funds. Feeding America member food banks provided food and other supplies to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. More than 243 truckloads of food and grocery products–or 7.6 million pounds — were distributed to 11 food banks and more than $1 million was secured from corporate partners. Hands on Network, an enterprise of Points of Light, registered volunteers to respond to the disaster. Humane Society of the United States deployed more than 140 staff and volunteers, helped rescue more than 350 animals from devastated areas, cared for more than 700 animals in emergency shelters, and helped set up four distribution centers for supplies. With the HSUS’ help, owners reclaimed more than 400 pets in total. Jewish Federations of North America launched the JFNA Hurricane Relief Fund to contribute to recovery and rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The Jewish Federation system across the continent raised $7.4 million to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. The funds already have gone toward basic amenities like food, clothing and housing, and will continue to be allocated for long-term needs. International Medical Corps mobilized emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas of Haiti. In addition to medical care and screenings, IMC also distributed hygiene, shelter and kitchen kits to internally displaced families. Medical Reserve Corps instituted numerous preparedness and response activities related to Hurricane Sandy. The units that performed sheltering functions reported staffing and/or assisting in the setup of general community, functional, or special needs shelters and working at shelters in support of the American Red Cross. Units also indicated that they provided the community with health education, emergency communications support, and surge staffing to local hospitals, emergency management agencies, and public health departments. Islamic Relief USA worked with Smile, a local organization in New Jersey, to distribute food parcels to families in need in New Jersey. IRUSA staff and volunteers also provided shelter management services and helped however else needed at two separate hurricane shelters on the campus of Rutgers University until the shelters closed on Nov. 2. IRUSA also worked with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help with cleanup efforts across New Jersey and New York. National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD) collaborated with state VOAD members and helped to coordinate on a regional, multi-state level. The organization also posted two resource papers on its website, on providing food to infants and children in a disaster, and promoting the Disaster Distress Hotline. New York Cares, an organization that mobilizes volunteers in the city year-round, kicked off its annual coat drive earlier than usual to meet needs caused by Sandy. The organization gathered coats at the Veteran’s Day Parade. Presbyterian Church in America – Mission to North America worked closely with local church leadership to assess needs. The organization also worked through VOAD affiliations to determine specific needs. It also mobilized volunteers to assist in Atlantic City. Quality Parks documented the impact of the hurricane on the beaches in the region and sought donations to begin a Long Island Master Naturalist program, which will train volunteers in four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Salvation Army served first responders and survivors at 16 shelters throughout New Jersey, and provided meals in 12 counties. In New York City, it is coordinated the city’s Food Access Plan, overseeing distribution of food and water to 17 sites in Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. In Nassau County, N.Y., meals ready to eat provided by the state and 1,000 blankets provided by The Salvation Army were distributed to residents of Island Park, one of the hardest hit areas. And in nearby Suffolk County, the Salvation Army worked to distribute in-kind donations for Sandy survivors. Samaritan’s Purse coordinated more than 8,600 volunteers who cleared debris, removed downed trees, and made emergency repairs for more than 1,300 homeowners. The organization also helped 40 people return home over the course of the next two years by making repairs and building new homes are at no cost to homeowners who were chosen because they lacked the means to restore their own homes or because they lost their houses completely in the hurricane. Save the Children delivered food, hygiene supplies, blankets, toys and children’s clothing to children and families in shelters. This included supplemental food for 15,545 children and their families and 150,000 diapers and other infant hygiene supplies for families with young children. They opened storm-tested Child-Friendly Spaces at 16 shelters for children who did not have safe places to play. These spaces benefited 1,485 children. Save also helped nearly 30 local centers to re-open, through grants or distributions of materials. Save the Children raised more than $3 million for the Hurricane Children in Emergency Fund. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief (SBDR) volunteers prepared more than 1 million hot meals within two weeks of landfall of Hurricane Sandy. More than 1,000 SBDR volunteers assisted victims of Hurricane Sandy. Sparkrelief.org helped feed more than 4,000 people, and partnered with Aubuchon Hardware to collect and distribute goods donated by thousands of people, and helped Lush Cosmetics distribute over $40,000 worth of bath products to those in need along the coast in New York and New Jersey. World Renew rapid response teams served in the New Jersey communities of Midland Park, Little Ferry, and Union Beach to remove downed trees, clean-out flooded homes, and prevent mold. Regional and project managers and staff assisted many communities in the early planning stages for a long-term recovery. World Renew provided start-up grants to committees in Bergen, Monmouth, and Middlesex Counties in New Jersey. World Vision disbursed over $2.4 million in assistance while working with strategic partners in providing disaster relief supplies, essential items and other non-food items that facilitated long-term recover in neighborhoods throughout New York City. Take Action Ensure the needs of vulnerable populations are being met by disaster response and recovery initiatives. These include the elderly with no young relatives, the physically and mentally disabled (including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder), etc. Invest in organizations that have a history of working in these areas and previous relationships with those involved. Additionally, assess ways to assist vulnerable populations in preparedness. Many residents in New York chose to shelter in place, which was made more difficult as power outages continued to for weeks. While some of those residents were resilient for a few days, as the disaster lingered on, living conditions became extremely challenging. Create preparedness programs that include potential outcomes, as well as weather forecast models that include consequence analysis. Improved risk analysis may help future populations be more willing to move out of harm’s way. Support further research into climate change and its effect on natural disaster occurrence. In addition, consider how this research could be linked to disaster risk reduction strategies. Develop guidelines for protecting children—both physically and psychologically—during and after disasters. Strategies for tracking displaced children, for example, could be improved, and standard protocols could be set for schools and day care centers. Explore more stable and resilient supply chains for medical needs, including prescriptions. Infrastructure damage—especially in areas of large populations—can mean many without access to the help they need. Seek out programs that aim to help with recovery and rebuilding in overlooked areas such as West Virginia, Connecticut, Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. With large population centers like New York and New Jersey affected, some of the less densely populated areas have not received as much media attention or philanthropic support. Learn More Facts & Stats Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. 286 people died, 146 of them in the U.S., making Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as the deadliest hurricane to hit the East cost since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. There were $68 billion in damages, much of it concentrated in New York and New Jersey, placing it among the worst U.S. disasters. Sandy damaged or destroyed 305,000 housing units and disrupted more than 265,000 businesses in New York. In New Jersey, 346,000 housing units were destroyed or damaged, and 190,000 businesses affected. Congress passed a $50.5 billion emergency package of relief and recovery aid. Added to the $9.7 billion previously approved for a federal flood insurance program, the total is roughly in line with the $60.4 billion President Barack Obama requested. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide.

The 1938 New England Hurricane (also referred to as the Great New England Hurricane, Long Island Express, and Yankee Clipper) was one of the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclones to strike Long Island, New York and New England. The storm formed near the coast of Africa on September 9, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane[1] on Long Island on September 21. It is estimated that the hurricane killed 682 people,[2] damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at $306 million ($4.7 billion in 2016).[3] Damaged trees and buildings were still seen in the affected areas as late as 1951.[4] It remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane in recorded New England history, perhaps eclipsed in landfall intensity only by the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.[5] The storm was first analyzed by ship data south of the Cape Verde Islands on September 9. Over the next 10 days, it steadily gathered strength and slowly tracked to the west-northwest; it is estimated to have reached Category 5 intensity by September 20, while centered east of the Bahamas. It then veered northward in response to a deep trough over Appalachia, sparing the Bahamas, Florida, the Carolinas, and the Mid-Atlantic states. At the same time, a high pressure system was centered north of Bermuda, preventing the hurricane from making an eastward turn out to sea.[6] Thus, the hurricane was effectively squeezed to the north between the two weather systems. This caused the storm's forward speed to increase substantially late on September 20. This extreme forward motion was in the same general direction as the winds on the eastern side of the storm as it proceeded north; this, in turn, caused the wind speed to be far higher in areas east of the storm's eye than would be the case with a hurricane of more typical forward speed.[7] The storm was centered several hundred miles to the southeast of Cape Hatteras during the early hours of September 21, and it weakened slightly. By 8:30 am EDT, it was centered approximately 100 miles (160 km) due east of Cape Hatteras, and its forward speed had increased to well over 50 mph. This rapid movement did not permit enough time for the storm to weaken over the cooler waters before it reached Long Island.[8] The hurricane sped through the Virginia tidewater during the 9:00 am hour. Between 12:00 pm and 2:00 pm, the New Jersey coastline and New York City caught the western edge.[9] At the same time, weather conditions began to deteriorate rapidly on Long Island and along the southern New England coast. The hurricane made landfall at Bellport on Long Island's Suffolk County sometime between 2:10 pm and 2:40 pm as a Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of 120 mph.[10] It made a second landfall as a Category 3 hurricane somewhere between Bridgeport and New Haven, Connecticut at around 4:00 pm, with sustained winds of 115 mph.[10] The storm's eye moved into western Massachusetts by 5:00 pm, and it reached Vermont by 6:00 pm. Both Westfield, Massachusetts and Dorset, Vermont reported calm conditions and partial clearing during passage of the eye, which is a rather unusual occurrence for a New England hurricane.[11] The hurricane began to lose tropical characteristics as it continued into northern Vermont, though it was still carrying hurricane-force winds. It crossed into Quebec at approximately 10:00 pm, transitioning into a post-tropical low. The post-tropical remnants dissipated over northern Ontario a few days later. In 1938, United States forecasting lagged behind forecasting in Europe, where new techniques were being used to analyze air masses, taking into account the influence of fronts. A confidential report was released by the United States Forest Service, the parent agency of the United States Weather Bureau. It described the weather bureau's forecasting as "a sorry state of affairs" where forecasters had poor training and systematic planning was not used, and where forecasters had to "scrape by" to get information wherever they could. The Jacksonville, Florida, office of the weather bureau issued a warning on September 19 that a hurricane might hit Florida. Residents and authorities made extensive preparations, as they had endured the Labor Day Hurricane three years earlier. When the storm turned north, the office issued warnings for the Carolina coast and transferred authority to the bureau's headquarters in Washington. At 9:00 am on September 21, the Washington office issued northeast storm warnings north of Atlantic City and south of Block Island, Rhode Island, and southeast storm warnings from Block Island to Eastport, Maine.[12] The advisory, however, underestimated the storm's intensity and said that it was farther south than it actually was.[12] The office had yet to forward any information about the hurricane to the New York City office.[12] At 10:00 am, the bureau downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. The 11:30 am advisory mentioned gale-force winds but nothing about a tropical storm or hurricane.[12] That day, 28 year-old rookie Charles Pierce was standing in for two veteran meteorologists. He concluded that the storm would be squeezed between a high-pressure area located to the west and a high-pressure area to the east, and that it would be forced to ride up a trough of low pressure into New England. A noon meeting was called and Pierce presented his conclusion, but he was overruled by "celebrated" chief forecaster Charles Mitchell and his senior staff. In Boston, meteorologist E.B. Rideout told his WEEI radio listeners (to the skepticism of his peers) that the hurricane would hit New England.[13] At 2:00 pm, hurricane-force gusts were occurring on Long Island's South Shore and near hurricane-force gusts on the coast of Connecticut. The Washington office issued an advisory saying that the storm was 75 miles east-southeast of Atlantic City and would pass over Long Island and Connecticut. Re-analysis of the storm suggests that the hurricane was farther north (just 50 miles from Fire Island), and that it was stronger and larger than the advisory said.[12] The majority of the storm damage was from storm surge and wind. Damage was estimated at $308 million, the equivalent of $5.1 billion adjusted for inflation in 2016 dollars, making it among the most costly hurricanes to strike the U.S. mainland.[14] It is estimated that, if an identical hurricane had struck in 2005, it would have caused $39.2 billion in damage due to changes in population and infrastructure.[15] Approximately 600 people died in the storm in New England, most in Rhode Island, and up to 100 people elsewhere in the path of the storm.[16] An additional 708 people were reported injured.[17] In total, 4,500 cottages, farms, and other homes were reported destroyed and 25,000 homes were damaged. Other damages included 26,000 automobiles destroyed and 20,000 electrical poles toppled. The hurricane also devastated the forests of the Northeast, knocking down an estimated two billion trees in New York and New England.[17] Freshwater flooding was minimal, however, as the quick passage of the storm decreased local rainfall totals, with only a few small areas receiving over 10 inches (250 mm). Over 35% of New England's total forest area was affected. In all, over 2.7 billion board feet of trees fell because of the storm, although 1.6 billion board feet of the trees were salvaged.[18] The Northeastern Timber Salvage Administration (NETSA) was established to deal with the extreme fire hazard that the fallen timber had created.[19] In many locations, roads from the fallen tree removal were visible decades later, and some became trails still used today. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad from New Haven to Providence was particularly hard hit, as countless bridges along the Shore Line were destroyed or flooded, severing rail connections to badly affected cities such as Westerly, Rhode Island. Due to the lack of technology in 1938, Long Island residents were not warned of the hurricane's arrival,[20] leaving no time to prepare or evacuate.[21] Long Island was struck first, before New England and Quebec, earning the storm the nickname the "Long Island Express."[21] The winds reached up to 150 mph with waves surging to around 25–35 feet high.[22] Yale and Harvard both owned large forests managed by their forestry departments, but both forests were wiped out by the hurricane. However, Yale had a backup forest at Great Mountain in northwestern Connecticut which was spared from the totality of the damages, and they were able to keep their forestry program running, which maintains operation today. Harvard's program, however, was reduced as a result.[23] The western side of the hurricane caused sustained tropical storm-force winds, high waves, and storm surge along the Jersey Shore[9] and destroyed much of the boardwalk in Atlantic City. The Brigantine Bridge was destroyed over Absecon Inlet between Atlantic City and Brigantine, New Jersey.[24] The surge inundated several coastal communities; Wildwood was under 3 feet (0.91 m) of water at the height of the storm, and the boardwalk was destroyed in Bay Head and dozens of cottages washed into the ocean. Crops sustained wind damage.[25] The maximum recorded wind gust was 70 mph at Sandy Hook.[9] The metropolitan area escaped the worst of the wind and storm surge because it was hit by the storm's weaker western side. Winds were recorded at 60 mph at Central Park, Battery Park recorded sustained winds of 70 mph with gusts to 80 mph, and a gust of 90 mph was recorded 500 feet above ground at the Daily News Building. Winds were estimated at 120 mph on top of the Empire State Building.[10] The highest winds were from the north to northwest on the back side of the storm.[26] The storm surge was 8½ feet at the Battery and the Mean Low Water storm tide was 16¾ feet at Willets Point.[10] In New York Harbor, the waters rose 7 feet in a half-hour.[10] In New York City and Long Island, schools were dismissed early.[12][27] Extensive street flooding occurred because debris blocked drains.[12] The East River flowed three blocks and flooded a Consolidated Edison (Con Ed) plant at 133rd Street, causing power to fail in Manhattan north of 59th Street and in the Bronx for several minutes to a few hours. Railroad and ferry services were suspended for a time. The Staten Island Ferry boat Knickerbocker got stuck in the terminal with 200 passengers aboard.[12][26] Bridges and tunnels into Manhattan were closed until the following afternoon. 95% of Nassau County lost power, where floods brought traffic to a halt.[26] In Manhasset Bay, almost 400 boats were ripped from their moorings and smashed or sunk, with more than 100 washing up on the beach by the Port Washington Yacht Club. Similar scenes occurred in other locations on the north shore. The J.P. Morgan estate in Glen Cove was heavily damaged. The wife of New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia was forced to wait out the storm on the second floor of their Northport cottage. Mitchel Field army airfield was buffeted by winds of nearly 100 mph and was under knee-deep water.[28] In Williston Park, residents of 50 homes needed to be rescued by rowboat when heavy rain the previous few days combined with the rain from the hurricane to overflow a pond.[2][27][29][30][31][32] Eastern Long Island experienced the worst of the storm. The Dune Road area of Westhampton Beach was obliterated, resulting in 29 deaths. There were 21 other deaths through the rest of the east end of Long Island. The storm surge temporarily turned Montauk into an island as it flooded across the South Fork at Napeague and obliterated the tracks of the Long Island Rail Road. Long Island was hit hard being exposed to the storm due to its shorelines. The estimated storm tide was 15 feet in this region. A mean low water storm tide of 8 feet was recorded at Port Jefferson.[10] About 50 people perished in the storm's wake.[20] All the shore lines were very vulnerable to the high winds and flooding, and anyone near the shores was directly in harm's way. Ten new inlets were created on eastern Long Island.[10] The surge rearranged the sand at the Cedar Point Lighthouse so that the island became connected to what is now Cedar Point County Park. The surging water created the Shinnecock Inlet by carving out a large section of barrier island separating Shinnecock Bay from the Atlantic. The storm toppled the landmark steeple of the Old Whaler's Church,[33] which was the tallest building in Sag Harbor. The steeple has not been rebuilt. Wading River suffered substantial damage. The storm blew down the movie theater on Front Street in Greenport on the North Fork of Long Island. The fishing industry was destroyed, as was half of the apple crop.[10] Water levels of the 1815 and 1938 hurricanes are marked at Old Market House, Providence The storm surge hit Westerly, Rhode Island at 3:50 pm, resulting in 100 deaths.[34] The tide was higher than usual because of the autumnal equinox and full moon, and the hurricane produced storm tides of 14 to 18 feet (5 m) along most of the Connecticut coast, with 18 to 25-foot (8 m) tides from New London east to Cape Cod—including the entire coastline of Rhode Island. The storm surge was especially violent along the Rhode Island shore, sweeping hundreds of summer cottages out to sea. Low-lying Block Island was almost completely underwater, and many drowned. As the surge drove northward through Narragansett Bay, it was restricted by the Bay's funnel shape and rose to 15.8 feet above normal spring tides, resulting in more than 13 feet (4.0 m) of water in some areas of downtown Providence. Several motorists were drowned in their automobiles.[35] In Jamestown, seven children were killed when their school bus was blown into Mackerel Cove.[36] Many stores in downtown Providence were looted by mobs, often before the flood waters had fully subsided and due in part to the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. Many homes and structures were destroyed along the coast, as well as many structures inland along the hurricane's path. Entire beach communities were obliterated on the coast of Rhode Island. Napatree Point was completely swept away, a small cape that housed nearly 40 families between the Atlantic Ocean and Little Narragansett Bay just off of Watch Hill. Today, Napatree is a wildlife refuge with no human inhabitants. One house in Charlestown, Rhode Island was lifted and deposited across the street, where it stood until it was demolished in August 2011. Even to this day, concrete staircases and boardwalk bases destroyed by the hurricane can be found when sand levels are low on some beaches. The boardwalk along Easton's Beach in Newport was completely destroyed by the storm.[36] A few miles from Conanicut Island, Whale Rock Light was swept off its base and into the raging waves, killing lighthouse keeper Walter Eberle. His body was never found. The Prudence Island Light suffered a direct blow from the storm surge, which measured 17 feet 5 inches at Sandy Point. The masonry tower was slightly damaged. However, the adjoining light keeper's home was utterly destroyed and washed out to sea. The light keeper's wife and son were both killed, as well as the former light keeper and a couple who left their summer cottages near the lighthouse and sought shelter in what they thought was the sturdier light keeper's home. Light keeper George T. Gustavus was thrown free from the wreckage of the house and was saved by an island resident who held a branch into the water from the cliffs farther down the coast. Gustavus and Milton Chase, the owner of the island's power plant, reactivated the light during the storm by running a cable from the plant to the light and installing a light bulb, marking the first time that it was illuminated with electricity.[37] The original parchment of the 1764 Charter of Brown University was washed clean of its text when its vault was flooded in a Providence bank.[38]Newport recorded the highest water level of the storm, at 3.53 meters above mean sea level according to a NOAA study.[39] This storm level is 0.98 meters above the SLOSH model of a 100-year storm, and one estimate is that this water level "reflects a storm occurring roughly once every 400 years."[40] A study of sand deposits also gives evidence that this was the strongest hurricane to hit Rhode Island in over 300 years.[39][40] The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier was completed in 1966 because of the massive flooding from the 1938 storm, and from the even higher 14.4 foot (4.4 meters) storm surge that resulted from 1954's Hurricane Carol, in hopes of preventing extreme storm surges from ever again flooding downtown Providence.[41] Eastern Connecticut was on the eastern side of the hurricane. Long Island acted as a buffer against large ocean surges, but the waters of Long Island Sound rose to great heights. Small shoreline towns to the east of New Haven experienced much destruction from the water and winds, and the 1938 hurricane holds the record for the worst natural disaster in Connecticut's 350-year history. The mean low-water storm tide was 14.1 feet at Stamford, 12.8 feet at Bridgeport, and 10.58 feet at New London, which remains a record high.[10] In the shoreline towns of Madison, Clinton, Westbrook, and Old Saybrook, buildings were found as wreckage across coastal roads. Actress Katharine Hepburn waded to safety from her Old Saybrook beach home, narrowly escaping death. She stated in her 1991 book that 95% of her personal belongings were either lost or destroyed, including her 1932 Oscar, which was later found intact.[42] In Old Lyme, beach cottages were flattened or swept away. The NYNH&H passenger train Bostonian became stuck in debris at Stonington. Two passengers drowned while attempting to escape before the crew was able to clear the debris and get the train moving.[12] Along the Stonington shorefront, buildings were swept off their foundations and found two miles (3 km) inland. Rescuers found live fish and crabs in kitchen drawers and cabinets while searching for survivors in the homes in Mystic. New London was first swept by the winds and storm surge, after which the waterfront business district caught fire and burned out of control for 10 hours. Stately homes along Ocean Beach were leveled by the storm surge. The permanently anchored 240-ton lightship at the head of New London Harbor was found on a sand bar two miles (3 km) away. Interior sections of the state experienced widespread flooding as the hurricane's torrential rains fell on soil already saturated from previous storms. The Connecticut River was forced out of its banks, inundating cities and towns from Hartford to Middletown. Novelist Ann Petry drew on her personal experiences of the hurricane in Old Saybrook in her 1947 novel Country Place. The novel is set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, but Petry identified the 1938 storm as the source for the storm that is at the center of her narrative.[citation needed] The eye of the storm followed the Connecticut River north into Massachusetts, where the winds and flooding killed 99 people. In Springfield, the river rose six to 10 feet (3 m) above flood stage, causing significant damage. Up to six inches (152 mm) of rain fell across western Massachusetts, which combined with over four inches (102 mm) that had fallen a few days earlier to produce widespread flooding. Flash flooding on the Chicopee River washed away the Chicopee Falls Bridge, while the Connecticut River flooded most of the Willimansett section. Residents of Ware were stranded for days and relied on air-dropped food and medicine. After the flood receded, the town's Main Street was a chasm in which sewer pipes could be seen. To the east, the surge left Falmouth and New Bedford under eight feet of water. Two-thirds of the boats sank in New Bedford harbor. Several homes washed away on Atlantic Boulevard in Fall River, whose foundations can still be found on the beach today. The Blue Hill Observatory registered sustained winds of 121 mph (195 km/h) and a peak gust of 186 mph (299 km/h), which is the strongest hurricane-related surface wind gust ever recorded in the United States.[43] A 50-foot wave, the tallest of the storm, was recorded at Gloucester.[10] The storm entered Vermont as a Category 1 hurricane at approximately 6:00 pm EDT, reaching northern Vermont, Burlington, and Lake Champlain around 8:00 pm.[11][30] Hurricane-force winds caused extensive damage to trees, buildings, and power lines. Over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of public roads were blocked, and it took months for crews to reopen some of the roads. In Montpelier, 120 miles (190 km) from the nearest coast, salt spray was seen on windows.[44] A train was derailed in Castleton.[30] The storm killed five people in Vermont. Maple and sugar groves were damaged.[45] The 1938 hurricane has been the only tropical cyclone to make a direct hit on Vermont in its recorded history; it remains the only one known to have struck Vermont as a hurricane. Even though the storm center tracked further west, through Vermont, New Hampshire received appreciable damage. As in Vermont, very high winds brought down numerous trees and electric lines, but rainfall totals in New Hampshire were significantly less than those in other states. Only 1 inch (25 mm) of rain fell in Concord.[citation needed] Damage at Peterborough was worse, however; total damage there was stated to be $500,000 (1938 dollars, $6.5 million in 2005), which included the destruction of 10 bridges. Much of the lower downtown burned because floodwaters prevented firefighters from reaching and extinguishing the blaze. Other communities also suffered considerable damage to forest resources. In New Hampshire, 13 people perished. At Mt. Washington, winds gusted to 163 miles per hour (262 km/h) and knocked down part of a trestle on the Cog Railway.[30] As the hurricane was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, it tracked into southern Quebec. By the time the system initially crossed into Canada, it continued to produce heavy rain and very strong winds, but interaction with land had taken its toll. Nevertheless, the hurricane managed to blow down numerous trees throughout the region.[48] Otherwise, damage was generally minimal.[49] ^Winds rotate counter-clockwise around all low pressure systems in the Northern Hemisphere. Winds on the right side of a hurricane (relative to the direction of the storm itself) are moving in the same general direction as the hurricane. Therefore, the forward motion increases the observed wind speed for points to the right of the eye of the hurricane and decreases the observed wind speed for points to the left of the eye. This occurs in a complex way that defies crude addition or subtraction of the forward motion from the intrinsic wind speed of the hurricane. Aviles, Lourdes B.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Sunday, October 28, 2012 2:25pm Sunday: Hurricane Sandy Forecast Look for a landfall late Monday in Delaware or New Jersey for Hurricane Sandy. At 2pm EDT, Hurricane Sandy was on predicted course with 75 mph winds and a central barometric pressure 951 millibars. This is the predicted wind field for 2pm EDT. It compares reasonably well with current weather station measurements if you use it for wind gusts in miles an hour. For example, Norfolk, VA is gusting to 50 mph. So, how does the wind field change over time? 8am EDT Monday Due to the falling pressures, the wind speeds are accelerating. Wind gusts above 50 mph are occurring on DelMarVa and into New Jersey. They are just making it to Long Island. 2pm EDT Monday Barometric pressures are dropping like a rock and wind speeds are spinning up accordingly. The bright orange colors are gusts to about 60 mph with the brown tones above 75 mph. Power failures will be occurring in large numbers and the storm surge will be piling up water. This would be a record low barometric pressure for the region. Lower pressures (other factors equal) increase wind speeds and raise storm surges. 8pm EDT Monday Landfall in NJ or Delaware. Winds capable of causing power failures extend from around Portland to Richmond and inland to Harrisburg and, perhaps, Buffalo. Wind gusts of 70 mph develop around DC and Baltimore. Wind speeds are increasing throughout the eastern Great Lakes region. The barometric pressure at landfall looks like it will be around 940-942 millibars. The storm from there moves inland and gradually weakens but may still cause gusts above 50 mph over the eastern Great Lakes region. The Storm Surge Let's take a minute to consider what I believe is the under-considered aspect of this storm: The storm surge. These forecasts do not include wave action which could be an additional 10 to 20 ft. in some areas! Bridgeport, CT click to enlarge You have two models as you can see if you enlarge the graph. Again, keep in mind the water will actually be higher than the 14' above sea level shown due to wave action. The Battery, NY This is a higher forecast stage at The Battery than was observed in Irene. If it reaches 11' as forecast moderate to major flooding will result. Addition at 2:45pm CDT (see below): Atlantic City, NJ Major flooding forecast. I'm concerned that most due not understand the level of threat due to Hurricane Sandy's storm surge. The posting below, "Finish Preparations" has the rest of the information about snow, etc. This is going to be the last "comprehensive" update because if you are not wrapping up preparations now, it is going to be too late by the time the next computer model cycle finishes (i.e., darkness and increasing winds). From this point on, I'm going to "nowcast" the storm (i.e., point out important short-term storm highlights) as it approaches and moves inland. I'm literally writing this on I-70 crossing the Missouri River near Columbia as Mindy drives us to St. Louis for tomorrow's talks. Hope you have ready to hunker down for one of Mother Nature's great shows.
Photos: Hurricane Sandy Devastated NYC Two Years Ago Today Two years ago today, Hurricane Sandy clobbered the tri-state area, leaving in its wake a massive amount of destruction that has cost billions of dollars in repairs. There are memorial events happening across the city today—Occupy Sandy and the Times both have listings on what's going on Mayor de Blasio and Gov. Cuomo will both be attending various memorials—and even Mr. Met is doing his part. CNN has a short timeline of the events of that day, along with a rundown of all the damages in the immediate NYC area. WNYC takes a look at the figures behind all the repair work that has been done so far restoring coastal defenses, and everything seems a lot better than it did even a year ago: "The consensus is that New York City is much safer now than it was two years ago," Dan Zarrilli, the director of the Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency said in a statement. "But we know there's still plenty of work ahead." But it seems we should place the emphasis in that quote on the "plenty of work ahead" part. Plenty of people are still recoveringfrom the storm. Sandy is estimated to have caused $65 billion in damages in the United States and was responsible for the deaths of 182 people; in NYC, 44 people were killed and there was over $19 billion in damages. “Sandy was the worst natural disaster to ever hit our city. As we remember those lost and the destruction Sandy wrought, it’s our responsibility to make every impacted family whole again, while building back stronger and safer to protect against the risks of climate change," Mayor de Blasio said in a statement today. "When we took office, Build it Back wasn’t delivering for families who needed it. Now, New Yorkers across the city have finally gotten the support they deserve, and we’ll continue to speed up relief until every homeowner is served. At the same time, we’re aggressively implementing our comprehensive resiliency plan. We are much safer now than we were two years ago—and there’s much work ahead." The City sent out this list of all the various changes that have occurred in the past two years: Short-term measures were quickly put in place to immediately reduce risk. For example: 4.15 million cubic yards of sand place on City beaches 26,000 linear feet of dunes on Staten Island alone, with more to come 10,500 linear feet of bulkhead repairs around the City Updated building codes, including 16 new local laws to improve residential and commercial resiliency $1 billion in resiliency investments being made by ConEd to harden critical assets like substations and switches Reforms to the national flood insurance program Longer-term measures are in development now across the entire City. For example: Over $400 million to construct new armored levees and other infrastructure along Midland Beach and Staten Island’s East Shore, to substantially reduce risk in the future Substantial investment in the next phase of coastal protection in the Rockaways and the communities surrounding Jamaica Bay T-groins in Sea Gate Dunes and other coastal protection in Breezy Point Flood protection in Red Hook Over $15 million in nature-based resiliency projects funded by the Department of Interior Coastal protection projects funded by the federal Rebuild by Design program, including: Lower East Side flood protection, for which the City started surveying work this fall; Hunts Point food supply protection; Living Breakwaters off of Staten Island’s South Shore, being implemented with the state The Huffington Post has some fascinating gifs showing the change in devastated neighborhoods between Oct 29th, 2012 and today. And while that is mostly a good thing, there is a dark side to all the restoration: there's still major work being done on various subway lines and tunnels (that's what happens when you have greater than $5 billion in damage). And the News points out that there are nearly 85,000 buildings, worth a combined $129.1 billion, now located in flood zones across the five boroughs. That's increased from about 24,000 buildings with a value of $58.7 billion before the feds redrew the flood maps in 2013. So there are now nearly 4x more buildings—many in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Manhattan Beach, Mill Basin, Bergen Beach, Canarsie and Greenpoint—that are more in danger of flooding today than there were two years ago. And there aren't enough oysters in the world to erect walls around the entire city. Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, has some suggestions how the city can strengthen its resiliency to future weather events, including offering floodplain buyouts to relocate residents in high risk areas. At least we've learned a few things from the catastrophe—like to be extra careful picking what organization we donate to. ProPublica and NPR have a scandalous joint piece on how the Red Cross has botched its recovery efforts that will make you question even the best organizations. We should forevermore refer to this as the Broken Hamburger theory of philanthropy. Mostly, this is what we can do today: remember what happened when the storm hit; remember where we were and how it felt when the lights went out; reflect upon the communal spirit of the city, the sacrifices made to save lives and avert even more tragedies from occurring; and most of all, not avert our gazefrom readingthe storiesof peoplewho were most devastated. In that regard, you can see an extensive visual tour through the storm and its wake above, culled from our coverage of Sandy. Below, a video focusing on the Galimi family, who lost their home during Sandy, but will finally be able to move back in by this Christmas thanks to the city's Build It Back program. Gothamist is now part of WNYC, a nonprofit organization that relies on its members for support. You can help us by making a donation today!

David Mccue (C), looks for pieces of his beach house that was completely demolished by Superstorm Sandy on November 25, 2012 in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. (CNN)Here's a look at Hurricane Sandy, which was also called "Superstorm Sandy." October 22-29, 2012 - Hurricane Sandy, as a hurricane and a post-tropical cyclone, is directly responsible for at least 147 deaths in the Northeast United States, Canada, and the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. The death toll in the United States directly attributed to Sandy includes 48 in New York, 12 in New Jersey, 5 in Connecticut, 2 in Pennsylvania, and five in other states. In the Caribbean, Haiti (54 deaths) and Cuba (11 deaths) are the countries affected the most, and there is one death in Canada.

disaster Hurricane Sandy Overview Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. Sandy was the deadliest hurricane to hit the Northeast in 40 years, and damage estimates have placed the cost at upwards of $68 billion. Only Hurricane Katrina cost more. Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic from Haiti and Jamaica and north into Canada. More than 200 deaths were attributed to the storm, with 146 of those in the United States and 98 in the Caribbean. NGOs remain on the ground helping people to rebuild their lives and local and federal jurisdictions are working to rebuild — and affect policy changes — to prevent such devastation from bring repeated. About $60.4 billion in federal aid has been provided to storm-affected areas. Background The 10th named storm of the 2012 hurricane season, Hurricane Sandy affected a wide swath of the Atlantic, with deaths extending from Haiti and Jamaica to Canada. While still out in the ocean, it affected North Carolina coastal areas, causing storm surges and flooding on barrier islands. As the storm came ashore in New Jersey, it was so massive that the effects were felt as far south as the mountains of Tennessee and West Virginia, and as far west as Lake Michigan. More than 200 deaths have since been attributed to the storm, with most of those in the United States. Sandy raised key questions about building in coastal areas, along with concerns and discussion about future storms. New York officials revived talk of a storm surge barrier to protect the city. The storm also recharged the issue of those who refuse mandatory evacuation orders, choosing to shelter in place instead. Hurricane Irene, which struck essentially the same area in 2011 without causing as much damage as feared, only complicated the issue of evacuation “need.” In Haiti, where residents continue to struggle to rebuild from the 2010 earthquake, the floods that followed the hurricane severely affected food security. The United Nations anticipates more than 1.5 million people at risk of food insecurity in 2013 due to the damage caused by Sandy. Cholera, which had broken out post-earthquake, was a continuing concern. In Cuba, news of the devastation was slow to arrive, though 20 percent of the population was affected. It took a full two weeks for the first aid to arrive, a 40-ton shipment from the United Nations. Another 40 tons quickly followed. U.S. Impact The hurricane made landfall in New York and New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, colliding with winter weather systems already present and creating a “perfect storm.” Widespread impact included destructive winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge flooding, and even heavy, wet snow. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide. At the height of the storm, more than 7.5 million people were without power. Power outages continued for weeks after the hurricane made landfall, yet many residents remained in their homes. In New England, Hurricane Sandy was complicated when a Nor’Easter blew in a few days later, bringing another blast of cold air and high storm surges to the area. West Virginia and Tennessee received nearly three feet of snow as a result of the storm. CDP Insights Insights from Dr. Irwin Redlener on Lessons from Hurricane Sandy: Dr. Irwin Redlener, Director, National Center for Disaster Preparedness, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University and Co-Chair, NYS Ready Commission and Center for Disaster Philanthropy Advisory Council Member outlines lessons in five key areas: evacuations, citizen preparedness, vulnerable populations, incident command and coordination, mental health, training, and recovery. Read his full analysis provided to Philanthropy New York. Insights from the CDP Advisory Council on Hurricane Sandy: While thousands of NGOs and volunteers rushed to offer much-needed immediate relief to communities and people impacted by Hurricane Sandy, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy estimated it would take years to fully rebuild communities in the United States and even longer in the Caribbean. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Advisory Council — experts from academia, the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors — offer their insights on long-term recovery needs and opportunities for donors. Donors While immediate relief dollars went to housing, food and clothing, the CDP Hurricane Sandy Disaster Fund was established to invest in long-term projects that fill gaps where public resources are unavailable or scarce. We requested grant applications from NGOs committed to projects that cross broad disciplines to ease the transition from disaster to normalcy; foster collaboration among donors; use existing local philanthropic networks and a work to strengthen local philanthropy; promote cross-sector coordination with academics, donors, think tanks, and public and private humanitarian actors; and support innovative research that informs policy and strengthens future disaster preparation and response. NGO Response AidMatrix worked to get the needs of impacted communities captured and listed on The National Donations Management Network. All Hands had two superstorm Sandy response efforts: Project Staten Island and Project Long Island. They housed staff and team leaders within the impacted areas, and coordinated efforts of volunteers to aid residents by removing debris (mucking) and removing affected walls/floors (gutting. American Red Cross worked both immediately and long-term to help those affected by the storm. Red Cross workers met with families to get them financial assistance to help with security and utility deposits, home repairs and rent, as well as link them to available social service programs. In addition, the Red Cross gave grants to a number of nonprofits working in New Jersey and New York to help people with home repairs, mold remediation, food and financial assistance, and to support the work of community. AmeriCares provided more than $6.5 million in aid, benefiting more than 450,000 people, including $3.5 million in medicines and relief supplies to hard-hit communities. AmeriCares also provided $3.0 million in funding to organizations ASPCA staff and responders provided immediate relief to families affected by flooding and power outages. Responders delivered supplies, crates and food to evacuation centers, where hundreds of animals were housed, in the five boroughs. After the storm, the ASPCA worked to ensure that animal shelters in some of the hardest-hit areas had the resources necessary to stay in operation. Through an emergency grant program, the ASPCA provided over 40 grants totaling over $350,000 to organizations responding to, or impacted by, Hurricane Sandy. The Coalition for the Homeless worked to repair damage to shelters in the New York area. Before the hurricane, 47,000 people were staying in homeless shelters, a 20 percent increase from 2011. Many of the homeless shelters were evacuated and some that offered specialty services, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and youths, were left without heat, while at least one encountered significant flooding. CERF (Craft Emergency Relief Fund + Artists’ Emergency Resources) offered emergency relief to craft artists and emergency resources that benefited all artists. In response to the storm, the organization launched the CERF+ Artists’ Relief Exchange in which artists can post needs and those with things or services to offer to artists can make them available. In addition, it offered grants up to $3,000 and no interest loans for craft artists who have had career-threatening emergencies. Church World Service shipped $480,000 worth of blankets, hygiene kits, baby care, emergency cleanup kits, and school kits to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It also launched a $100,000 appeal to provide relief in Haiti and Cuba. Catholic Charities USA worked with its local agencies to assess needs that Hurricane Sandy created in communities and provided immediate services. It estimated that 50 of its local agencies provided direct relief. In the months following Hurricane Sandy, Catholic Charities USA distributed approximately $2.75 million worth of grants and in-kind donations to Catholic Charities agencies affected by Hurricane Sandy. CCUSA has also pledged to provide additional services in the form of long-term recovery grants totaling roughly $5 million for disbursement over the next five years. Collegiate Church Corporation designated $200,000 to Hurricane Sandy relief. The organization’s five ministries are engaged in hands-on recovery work in Staten Island, the Rockaways, the New Jersey shore and the East Village. They distributed food and supplies and helped with clean up and rebuilding efforts. Episcopal Relief and Development remained in contact with key diocesan staff to gather information about where damage had occurred and what the most pressing needs were. Many Episcopal congregations launched into action, expanding their feeding ministries, providing basic supplies and gas cards, and hosting community agencies that connected people to services and federal disaster funds. Feeding America member food banks provided food and other supplies to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. More than 243 truckloads of food and grocery products–or 7.6 million pounds — were distributed to 11 food banks and more than $1 million was secured from corporate partners. Hands on Network, an enterprise of Points of Light, registered volunteers to respond to the disaster. Humane Society of the United States deployed more than 140 staff and volunteers, helped rescue more than 350 animals from devastated areas, cared for more than 700 animals in emergency shelters, and helped set up four distribution centers for supplies. With the HSUS’ help, owners reclaimed more than 400 pets in total. Jewish Federations of North America launched the JFNA Hurricane Relief Fund to contribute to recovery and rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The Jewish Federation system across the continent raised $7.4 million to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. The funds already have gone toward basic amenities like food, clothing and housing, and will continue to be allocated for long-term needs. International Medical Corps mobilized emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas of Haiti. In addition to medical care and screenings, IMC also distributed hygiene, shelter and kitchen kits to internally displaced families. Medical Reserve Corps instituted numerous preparedness and response activities related to Hurricane Sandy. The units that performed sheltering functions reported staffing and/or assisting in the setup of general community, functional, or special needs shelters and working at shelters in support of the American Red Cross. Units also indicated that they provided the community with health education, emergency communications support, and surge staffing to local hospitals, emergency management agencies, and public health departments. Islamic Relief USA worked with Smile, a local organization in New Jersey, to distribute food parcels to families in need in New Jersey. IRUSA staff and volunteers also provided shelter management services and helped however else needed at two separate hurricane shelters on the campus of Rutgers University until the shelters closed on Nov. 2. IRUSA also worked with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help with cleanup efforts across New Jersey and New York. National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD) collaborated with state VOAD members and helped to coordinate on a regional, multi-state level. The organization also posted two resource papers on its website, on providing food to infants and children in a disaster, and promoting the Disaster Distress Hotline. New York Cares, an organization that mobilizes volunteers in the city year-round, kicked off its annual coat drive earlier than usual to meet needs caused by Sandy. The organization gathered coats at the Veteran’s Day Parade. Presbyterian Church in America – Mission to North America worked closely with local church leadership to assess needs. The organization also worked through VOAD affiliations to determine specific needs. It also mobilized volunteers to assist in Atlantic City. Quality Parks documented the impact of the hurricane on the beaches in the region and sought donations to begin a Long Island Master Naturalist program, which will train volunteers in four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Salvation Army served first responders and survivors at 16 shelters throughout New Jersey, and provided meals in 12 counties. In New York City, it is coordinated the city’s Food Access Plan, overseeing distribution of food and water to 17 sites in Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. In Nassau County, N.Y., meals ready to eat provided by the state and 1,000 blankets provided by The Salvation Army were distributed to residents of Island Park, one of the hardest hit areas. And in nearby Suffolk County, the Salvation Army worked to distribute in-kind donations for Sandy survivors. Samaritan’s Purse coordinated more than 8,600 volunteers who cleared debris, removed downed trees, and made emergency repairs for more than 1,300 homeowners. The organization also helped 40 people return home over the course of the next two years by making repairs and building new homes are at no cost to homeowners who were chosen because they lacked the means to restore their own homes or because they lost their houses completely in the hurricane. Save the Children delivered food, hygiene supplies, blankets, toys and children’s clothing to children and families in shelters. This included supplemental food for 15,545 children and their families and 150,000 diapers and other infant hygiene supplies for families with young children. They opened storm-tested Child-Friendly Spaces at 16 shelters for children who did not have safe places to play. These spaces benefited 1,485 children. Save also helped nearly 30 local centers to re-open, through grants or distributions of materials. Save the Children raised more than $3 million for the Hurricane Children in Emergency Fund. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief (SBDR) volunteers prepared more than 1 million hot meals within two weeks of landfall of Hurricane Sandy. More than 1,000 SBDR volunteers assisted victims of Hurricane Sandy. Sparkrelief.org helped feed more than 4,000 people, and partnered with Aubuchon Hardware to collect and distribute goods donated by thousands of people, and helped Lush Cosmetics distribute over $40,000 worth of bath products to those in need along the coast in New York and New Jersey. World Renew rapid response teams served in the New Jersey communities of Midland Park, Little Ferry, and Union Beach to remove downed trees, clean-out flooded homes, and prevent mold. Regional and project managers and staff assisted many communities in the early planning stages for a long-term recovery. World Renew provided start-up grants to committees in Bergen, Monmouth, and Middlesex Counties in New Jersey. World Vision disbursed over $2.4 million in assistance while working with strategic partners in providing disaster relief supplies, essential items and other non-food items that facilitated long-term recover in neighborhoods throughout New York City. Take Action Ensure the needs of vulnerable populations are being met by disaster response and recovery initiatives. These include the elderly with no young relatives, the physically and mentally disabled (including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder), etc. Invest in organizations that have a history of working in these areas and previous relationships with those involved. Additionally, assess ways to assist vulnerable populations in preparedness. Many residents in New York chose to shelter in place, which was made more difficult as power outages continued to for weeks. While some of those residents were resilient for a few days, as the disaster lingered on, living conditions became extremely challenging. Create preparedness programs that include potential outcomes, as well as weather forecast models that include consequence analysis. Improved risk analysis may help future populations be more willing to move out of harm’s way. Support further research into climate change and its effect on natural disaster occurrence. In addition, consider how this research could be linked to disaster risk reduction strategies. Develop guidelines for protecting children—both physically and psychologically—during and after disasters. Strategies for tracking displaced children, for example, could be improved, and standard protocols could be set for schools and day care centers. Explore more stable and resilient supply chains for medical needs, including prescriptions. Infrastructure damage—especially in areas of large populations—can mean many without access to the help they need. Seek out programs that aim to help with recovery and rebuilding in overlooked areas such as West Virginia, Connecticut, Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. With large population centers like New York and New Jersey affected, some of the less densely populated areas have not received as much media attention or philanthropic support. Learn More Facts & Stats Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. 286 people died, 146 of them in the U.S., making Sandy the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as the deadliest hurricane to hit the East cost since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. There were $68 billion in damages, much of it concentrated in New York and New Jersey, placing it among the worst U.S. disasters. Sandy damaged or destroyed 305,000 housing units and disrupted more than 265,000 businesses in New York. In New Jersey, 346,000 housing units were destroyed or damaged, and 190,000 businesses affected. Congress passed a $50.5 billion emergency package of relief and recovery aid. Added to the $9.7 billion previously approved for a federal flood insurance program, the total is roughly in line with the $60.4 billion President Barack Obama requested. In New York and New Jersey, the storm surges were higher than 13 feet above the average low tide.

Hurricane Sandy Tax Relief NY State passed legislation to provide property tax relief to New York City property owners that had property damage as a result of Hurricane Sandy. Starting with this tax year (2015/16), owners that rebuild or repair Hurricane Sandy damage may qualify for an adjustment to their property values. The legislation caps how much a property’s Assessed Value can be increased due to improvements made to fix a home that was damaged in the storm. This means that the Assessed Value for a property is no higher than it would have been had the storm not occurred, unless the property is built larger. The new Assessed Value will be the base for future values going forward.
Hurricane Sandy closed in on the United States on Saturday as it threatened to hit the eastern third of the country with torrential rains, high winds, major flooding and power outages a week before US presidential and congressional elections. A massive but slow-moving storm, with tropical storm-force winds extending across 650 miles, forecasters warn Sandy's flood impact could span multiple tides with a storm surge of four to eight feet in Long Island Sound, the southern portion of Lower New York Bay and Delaware Bay. Rain accumulations of up to 12 inches were likely in some areas. As it merges with an Arctic jet stream, forecasters said Sandy had all the ingredients to morph into a so-called "super storm", unlike anything seen over the eastern United States in decades. Coastal flooding posed a major threat, particularly in low-lying areas like New York City, and Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington DC. That threat was described in a blog posted on Weather Underground by veteran weather forecaster Bryan Norcross as "serious as a heart attack for anybody near the rising water". Governors in states along the east coast declared emergencies, with officials urging residents to stock up on food, water and batteries. Coming in the hectic run-up to the presidential election on 6 November, the storm presented a challenge to the campaigns of President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney. As Sandy approached, Romney was rescheduling all of his campaign events planned for Virginia on Sunday and flying to Ohio instead. And Obama's campaign announced that vice-president Joe Biden had canceled a Saturday trip to Virginia Beach. Ahead of the election, millions of Americans are taking advantage of early voting arrangements to cast their ballots. State officials said they had put in place contingency plans in case Sandy caused extended power outages or other problems that could disrupt voting. The White House said the president convened a call with homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano, Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) administrator Craig Fugate and other officials to receive a Saturday update on ongoing government actions to prepare for the storm. In New York, authorities were considering closing down the city's buses, subways, commuter railroads, bridges and tunnels in preparations for the storm's onslaught. A decision on the transportation system was likely to come on Sunday, said state operations director Howard Glaser. A potential shutdown could begin at 7pm on Sunday, when the last commuter trains would depart, with the entire system to be closed down by 3 am Monday, officials said. Sandy was about 335 miles south-east of Charleston, South Carolina, and packing top sustained winds of 75mph on Saturday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said. The cyclone had briefly dropped just below hurricane strength early Saturday.Little overall change in strength was expected ahead of its anticipated US landfall early next week, the Miami-based Hurricane Center said. The storm picked up a little forward speed but was still moving slowly over the Atlantic at 11mph. A jog east late Saturday morning briefly took Sandy further out to sea. The storm's windfield has continued to expand, with hurricane force winds now extending 105 miles from its center, government forecasters said. Gale force winds were expected to reach portions of the mid-Atlantic coast by late Sunday and would begin hitting New York's Long Island and southern New England by Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center said. "It's hard to imagine how millions of people are not going to be without power for an extended period of time," Norcross said. Sandy battered the Bahamas southeast of Florida on Friday after causing widespread destruction in eastern Cuba a day earlier. The storm's powerful winds and rains were blamed for at least 41 deaths in several Caribbean countries, including 11 in Cuba. Most were killed by falling trees and building collapses. "Perhaps the biggest concern, at the very end, may be the extreme rainfall that's going to occur after landfall," Landsea said. In addition to coastal and inland flooding, along with widespread power outages, Sandy was expected to dump heavy wet snow in south-west Pennsylvania and as far inland as Ohio. High winds also threaten to disrupt air travel along the US East Coast.Tropical storm warnings and watches along Florida's east coast were lifted on Saturday as the storm moved north. Tropical storm-force winds were being felt near the North Carolina coast and tropical storm warnings for all of the coastal portion of the state, along with about half of South Carolina, were in effect. Along North Carolina's Outer Banks barrier islands, which jut out into the Atlantic, residents and officials said they were taking a wait-and-see approach to the storm. As the winds and rains increased Saturday, ferry service between Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands on the Outer banks was suspended due to water on Ocracoke's only highway. "Right now it's blowing pretty hard," said Ray Waller, manager of the Ocracoke office of North Carolina Ferry Division. Outer Banks residents, with memories of damaging flooding from last year's hurricane Irene, moved vehicles to higher ground and secured outside objects ahead of winds of more than 60mph beginning Saturday night and potentially lasting into Monday. A buoy 225 miles south of Cape Hatteras recorded 26-foot waves amid blistering wind gusts early on Saturday, authorities said. Many forecasters are warning that Sandy could be more destructive than Irene, which caused billions of dollars in damage across the US north-east.
Songs of Sympathy and Endurance, From Voices Touched by Hurricane Patrick Shepherd and Erin Reilly watched the benefit concert on Friday night.Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times On Friday night, NBC presented an hourlong telethon, “Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together,” to raise money for the American Red Cross. It was just four days after the storm made landfall in New Jersey on a course that would smash coastal and riverside neighborhoods all the way up to Rhode Island. “One of the great ironies of this telethon is that the people who need the help most can’t watch it,” said the host, Matt Lauer. “They don’t have power.” Many of the musicians came from places affected by the storm: Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi from New Jersey, Billy Joel from Long Island and Christina Aguilera and Mary J. Blige from New York City, along with an Englishman, Sting, and three members of Aerosmith, from Boston. Photo A monitor showed Bruce Springsteen performing.Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times The songs offered sympathy, encouragement and emotive belting. There was also a little jocularity: a rendition of “Under the Boardwalk” with lead vocals shared by the talk-show host Jimmy Fallon and Steve Tyler of Aerosmith, while Mr. Joel took the doo-wop low notes and Mr. Springsteen sang in the background. (Afterward, Mr. Fallon said on Twitter, “Not my idea to sing lead.”) Between the songs were calls for donations, affirmations of Jersey roots — from Jon Stewart, Brian Williams and Danny DeVito — and news montages of destruction and desperation: surging waters, demolished carnival rides, tearful families sorting through the wreckage of destroyed homes. The show took place in NBC’s studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza with a small invited audience. But it was broadcast on many cable networks, on terrestrial and satellite radio stations and on a live Web stream. It was not a fancy production. The musicians were on a somber, darkened stage with a blue backdrop that may have been intended as aquatic. And the microphones were not always working. But some of the songwriters had done rewrites for the occasion. Mr. Joel changed the calamity in the opening verse of “Miami 2017” into a storm where “out in the Rockaways, the oceans overflowed” and “Staten Island drowned.” And when Ms. Blige sang “The Living Proof,” she changed “I” to “we,” transforming a song about individual survival into one of shared perseverance and performing it with gospel-rooted drama. Most performers stripped down their songs. Mr. Bon Jovi, preceded by a video that showed him visiting his hard-hit hometown, Sayreville, turned Bon Jovi’s ringing “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” and “Livin’ on a Prayer” into a pensive acoustic medley. Mr. Tyler and the guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, from Aerosmith, played “Dream On” without a rhythm section; it got shaky at times, but amid the telethon’s hurricane footage, one line was newly telling: “The past is gone.” Sting moved “Message in a Bottle” onto acoustic guitar, picking its intricate lines backed by a percussionist. Christina Aguilera belted “Beautiful” over a solo piano. The finale belonged to Bruce Springsteen, whose early albums were full of songs situated on the Jersey Shore — including one presciently called “4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy),” about last-chance romance amid the carnival attractions. But perhaps that would have been off-message. Instead, he chose the uplift of the more recent “Land of Hope and Dreams,” and with the E Street Band chiming behind him, he promised, “Tomorrow there’ll be sunshine/And all this darkness past.” Afterward, Mr. Springsteen added, “God bless New York. God bless the Jersey Shore.” A version of this review appears in print on November 4, 2012, on Page A31 of the New York edition with the headline: Songs of Sympathy and Endurance, From Voices Touched by Hurricane.

Deaths Associated with Hurricane Sandy — October–November 2012 On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy* hit the northeastern U.S. coastline. Sandy's tropical storm winds stretched over 900 miles (1,440 km), causing storm surges and destruction over a larger area than that affected by hurricanes with more intensity but narrower paths. Based on storm surge predictions, mandatory evacuations were ordered on October 28, including for New York City's Evacuation Zone A, the coastal zone at risk for flooding from any hurricane (1). By October 31, the region had 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) of precipitation, 7–8 million customers without power, approximately 20,000 persons in shelters, and news reports of numerous fatalities (Robert Neurath, CDC, personal communication, 2013). To characterize deaths related to Sandy, CDC analyzed data on 117 hurricane-related deaths captured by American Red Cross (Red Cross) mortality tracking during October 28–November 30, 2012. This report describes the results of that analysis, which found drowning was the most common cause of death related to Sandy, and 45% of drowning deaths occurred in flooded homes in Evacuation Zone A. Drowning is a leading cause of hurricane death but is preventable with advance warning systems and evacuation plans. Emergency plans should ensure that persons receive and comprehend evacuation messages and have the necessary resources to comply with them. Red Cross tracks deaths during disasters to provide services to surviving family members, including crisis counseling, assistance with disaster-related expenses, locating emergency housing, identifying recovery resources, and addressing disaster-related health needs. Red Cross volunteers search for reports of disaster-related deaths from sources such as funeral home directors, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), hospitals, and news reports. Volunteers then obtain information about these deaths from sources including the medical examiner/coroner, physician, fire department/police, and family of the decedent (2). Deaths included in this analysis were any Sandy-related death recorded on a Red Cross mortality form with a date of death up to November 30, 2012. Mortality forms included the decedent's age, sex, race (white, black, Asian, other, or unknown), and date and location of death. Disaster-related deaths were categorized as direct or indirect. Directly related deaths are deaths caused by the environmental force of the disaster (e.g., wind or flood) or by the direct consequences of these forces (e.g., structural collapse). Indirectly related deaths are defined as deaths occurring in a situation in which the disaster led to unsafe conditions (e.g., hazardous roads) or caused a loss or disruption of usual services that contributed to the death (e.g., loss of electrical services) (2). Deaths without direct or indirect classification were reported as unknown or possibly related deaths. Daily counts of direct, indirect, and unknown/possibly related deaths were calculated based on the dates of each death. The characteristics of drowning deaths were compared with all deaths using chi-square tests of trend and t-tests. Home addresses of decedents whose drowning death occurred in the home were examined with respect to FEMA's hurricane storm surge area (field-verified as of November 11, 2012 [3]) and known, geographically defined areas under evacuation order (i.e., New York City's Evacuation Zone A) (1). A total of 117 deaths were reported on Red Cross mortality forms. The source of information for the mortality forms was a medical examiner/coroner for 94 (80.3%) cases and the family of the decedent for 10 (8.5%) cases (Table). Most deaths occurred in New York (53 [45.3%]) and New Jersey (34 [29.1%]); the other deaths occurred in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland. The deaths occurred during October 28–November 29, 2012 (Figure 1). Approximately half of the deaths (60 [51.3%]) occurred on the first 2 days of the storm's landfall, with a peak of 37 deaths on October 30, 2012. Decedents ranged in age from 1 to 94 years (mean: 60 years, median: 65 years); 60.7% were male, and 53.8% were white. Of the 117 deaths, 67 (57.3%) were classified as directly related deaths, and 38 (32.5%) were indirectly related to the storm. Of the directly related deaths, the most common mechanism was drowning (40 [59.7%]), followed by trauma from being crushed, cut, or struck (19 [28.4%]). Poisoning was the most common indirectly related cause of death; of the 10 poisonings, nine were caused by carbon monoxide. Most directly related deaths occurred during the first few days of the storm, whereas indirectly related deaths continued from the day before the storm into the middle of November. Comparing the 40 drowning deaths to all Sandy-related deaths, the age, sex, and race distributions of decedents were similar (Table). The majority of drowning deaths (29 [72.5%]) also occurred in the initial phase of the storm, during October 29–31. Twenty-one (52.5%) drowning deaths occurred in the decedent's home, and 11 (27.5%) occurred outside; one person drowned in a flooded commercial building lobby, and another person drowned while intentionally swimming off a storm-affected beach. For six deaths, circumstances of the drowning were not available. The location of drowning deaths by state was significantly different (p<0.05) compared with all Sandy-related deaths. The majority of drowning deaths (32 [80.0%]) occurred in New York, whereas deaths in New York accounted for only 27.3% of nondrowning deaths. Twenty decedents drowned in flooded homes in New York, and home addresses for 18 (90.0%) of them were located in Evacuation Zone A (Figure 2); the other two decedents' homes were in or near areas of flooding and near Evacuation Zone A. Notes written by Red Cross volunteers on these 20 deaths captured decedents' reasons for not evacuating, such as "afraid of looters," "thought Hurricane Irene was mild," and "unable to leave because did not have transportation." Editorial Note The "perfect storm" weather conditions of Hurricane Sandy resulted in extensive damage to infrastructure and large flood zones (4). The direct and indirect impacts of the storm led to challenging, and sometimes deadly, conditions for residents, including prolonged power outages, storm surges, and disrupted services. More than half (51.3%) of deaths from Sandy occurred within the first 2 days of the storm, and the most common cause of death was drowning. Approximately half of the drowning deaths were in flooded homes located in areas that were under mandatory evacuation orders as of October 28, 2012, the day before Sandy's landfall (1). Before the 1970s, drowning from wind-driven storm surges was by far the most common cause of hurricane-related death (5). Advances in hurricane warning and evacuation systems have helped to reduce drowning deaths. Since that time, hurricanes have had other leading causes of death, such as trauma for the Florida hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, and carbon monoxide poisoning for Hurricane Ike in 2008 (6,7). However, drowning continues to be an important cause of death, and was the leading cause for Hurricane Katrina (2005) and Sandy (8). The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the number of deaths reported is limited to those captured through Red Cross mortality tracking, which is only activated in areas with a Red Cross Disaster Relief Operation. In an evaluation of Red Cross mortality tracking versus Texas' active disaster-related mortality surveillance during Hurricane Ike, Red Cross had a sensitivity of 47% (Red Cross cases compared with Texas cases) and positive predictive value of 92% (Red Cross Ike cases compared with all Red Cross cases); thus, the cases presented in this report are likely to be actual cases but are unlikely to include all Sandy-related deaths (2). Media sources have reported 131 fatalities in the United States from the storm (9); Sandy mortality statistics, including death certificates, are pending official release. Second, the specific location of death was only available for decedents who died at home, limiting other geographic comparisons. Additionally, New York City's Evacuation Zones provided the only geographic data available for identifying areas of evacuation; however, 95% of all drowning deaths at home were in or near these areas. Hurricane-related drowning deaths in evacuation zones are preventable. A successful evacuation depends on officials providing timely messaging to all affected persons, on persons receiving those messages, and on persons having the capacity, resources, and willingness to evacuate. The penetration of evacuation messages to decedents or their communities was not assessed in this report, but future research should evaluate the effectiveness of the hurricane evacuation orders. Given the inability and unwillingness of some residents to evacuate, additional research is needed to identify barriers and motivators for persons during an evacuation and the effectiveness of interventions designed to assist these persons. * Sandy evolved from a Category 3 hurricane in the Caribbean to an intense post-tropical cyclone before landfall in the United States. What is already known on this topic? Despite advances in hurricane warning and evacuation systems, drowning remains one of the leading causes of hurricane-related deaths. What is added by this report? A total of 117 deaths related to Hurricane Sandy were reported via the American Red Cross mortality tracking system. Drowning was the leading cause, accounting for approximately one third of the deaths. More than half (52.5%) of the drowning deaths occurred in the decedent's home; the majority of these homes were located in New York City's Evacuation Zone A. What are the implications for public health practice? Drowning is a preventable cause of hurricane-related death. Hurricane response plans should ensure that persons receive and comprehend evacuation messages and have the necessary resources to comply with them. TABLE.

We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of the vector of Hurricane Sandy for the day. Read our latest summary here. The American Red Cross page on how to deal with power outages is here. FEMA's checklist of what to do before a hurricane hits is here. The storm is currently predicted to make landfall in the northeastern US sometime Monday. We'll be following the story closely and will have the latest updates on the Guardian home page. 10.27pm BST Budget cuts threaten weather forecasting capabilities A year ago almost to the day Suzanne Goldenberg, the Guardian environment correspondent, wrote about how one of Barack Obama's top science officials warned that America and Europe face a "disaster in the making" because of Congress budget cuts to a critical weather satellite: The satellite crosses the Earth's poles 14 times a day, monitoring the atmosphere, clouds, ice, vegetation, and oceans. It provides 90% of the information used by the National Weather Service, UK Met Office and other European agencies to predict severe storms up to seven days in advance. But Republican budget-cutting measures would knock out that critical capacity by delaying the launch of the next generation of polar-orbiting satellites, said Jane Lubchenco, who heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (Noaa). "It is a disaster in the making. It's an expression of the dysfunction in our system," said Lubchenco, who was speaking at a dinner on the sidelines of the Society of Environmental Journalists meeting in Miami. The looming gap in satellite coverage, which some experts now view as almost certain to occur within the next few years, could result in shaky forecasts about storms like Hurricane Sandy, which is now expected to hit the Northeastern Seaboard early next week. Updated at 10.28pm BST 10.20pm BST New York State is now also under a state of emergency, a designation that frees the state to dispatch urgent assistance and deploy the National Guard, need be. Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) BREAKING: Gov declares state of #emergency in NYS in prep for potential impact of #Sandy The latest National Hurricane Center projection for the storm's track moves its anticipated landfall slightly back to Monday afternoon or evening and places the storm a bit farther off the North Carolina coast.

Photograph: NHC 9.40pm BST Summary The National Hurricane Center is due to update its Sandy advisory at 5pm ET. Here's a summary of where things stand: • The storm is moving slowly off the east coast of Florida. It's currently a category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75mph. • Forecasts call for Sandy to make landfall in the northeastern US late Monday or early Tuesday. Virginia and Maryland have declared states of emergency. The projected path of Hurricane Sandy, according to the National Hurricane Center's 2pm forecast. The storm was expected to make landfall Monday. Photograph: NHS • The death toll from the storm in Haiti, Cuba, Jamaica and the Bahamas now stands at 41. •The storm is a serious threat because of its size and because the jet stream threatens to push it through heavily populated areas,where it could converge with a separate winter storm coming from the west. Meteorologists are on high alert because of the storm's exceptionally low atmospheric pressure at this stage. •The wind field for the storm at the time of landfall is more than 1,000 miles across in most models. Days of high winds and rainfall can be expected even hundreds of miles from the storm center. •The American Red Cross page on how to deal with power outages is here.

Updated at 9.17pm BST 8.54pm BST The American Red Cross page on how to deal with power outages is here. FEMA's checklist of what to do before a hurricane hits is here. 8.38pm BST Extreme weather and climate change Environmental campaigners are hoping that the approach of Hurricane Sandy will at last force Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to talk about the strange absence of that existential crisis known as climate change from this campaign. Extreme weather is a strong contemporary signal for climate change. Campaign groups believe the extreme weather of 2011 and 2012 – with hurricanes, heat waves, floods, droughts , wildfires in the US and the epic melting in the Arctic – are behind a sharp rise in the number of Americans who believe in global warming over the last two years. As Sandy barrels in, climate messaging firms and campaign groups are putting out primers on the connections between climate change and extreme weather, and the rising costs over the last few years of dealing with monster storms. The challenge of course is whether either Obama or Romney will care to make that link on the campaign trail. The question, Suzanne writes, is how much climate change might be to blame for storms like Sandy: Climate change certainly makes strong storms even stronger. There is ample evidence that global warming is responsible for the increasing intensity of Atlantic hurricanes and a longer hurricane season – but no single storm can be attributed to global warming. Five of the top north Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded occurred in the last eight years, including Katrina, Rita, and Ivan. Hurricanes are now producing greater storm surges, heavier rain and more flooding than in the past as evidenced by Irene last year, which caused widespread flooding in the north-east, and Debby last June, which produced up to 2ft of rain in some locations in Florida. “Climate change has led to warmer oceans and a warmer environment and more moisture for these storms which makes them more intense than they otherwise would be,” said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. The warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures provide extra fuel for those storms. That extra boost, combined with heavy and prolonged rain, stronger storm surges and coastal erosion in places, mean severe storms can pack a punch even relatively far inland. “What it really does is that it gives rise to a greater risk of flooding,” Trenberth said. Updated at 8.42pm BST 8.03pm BST Mayor Michael Bloomberg has just held a news conference about how New York City is preparing for Sandy. Bloomberg said Sandy is expected sometime Monday. But that could change. "Our city is very likely to feel its effects... lasting for several days," he says. Bloomberg says bridges may have to be closed. The MTA suspends subway, bus and other transit services in advance of the arrival of sustained winds at 39mph or higher, he says. Power outages are a possibility. That would be Alabama at one end of the wind field and New Brunswick on the other. That's 1,000 miles. The 940-mb in the tweet below refers to atmospheric pressure. Lower pressure correlates with stronger winds. That 940 number is terribly low. Bob Henson of the University Center for Atmospheric Research: While a couple of hurricane landfalls in Florida have produced pressures in this range, most cities in the Northeast have never reached such values, as is evident in this state-by-state roundup. The region’s lowest pressure on record occurred with the 1938 hurricane at Bellport, Long Island (946 hPa). Delaware Governor Jack Markell has warned residents to prepare for the arrival of Sandy. “People should be prepared to leave if they are in areas that tend to flood,” Markell said in an interview. “And everybody ought to secure their homes against wind and flooding, and also people ought to be prepared to be in their homes for a few days, possibly without power.” UPDATE: Markell has not declared a state of emergency for Delaware, as previously reported. A state of emergency holds for Virginia and Maryland. Updated at 8.44pm BST 7.42pm BST President Obama meets with the director of FEMA to discuss preparations for Hurricane Sandy. President Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy during a conference call with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, Dr. Rick Knabb, Director of the National Hurricane Center, and John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, in the Oval Office, Oct. 26, 2012.

Cuba was hit hard: Sandy, which weakened to a category 1 hurricane Thursday night, caused havoc in Cuba Thursday, killing 11 people in eastern Santiago and Guantanamo provinces as its howling winds and rain toppled houses and ripped off roofs. Authorities said it was Cuba's deadliest storm since July 2005, when category 5 Hurricane Dennis killed 16 people and caused $2.4 billion in damage. Sandy also killed one person while battering Jamaica on Wednesday and 16 in Haiti, where heavy rains from the storm's outer bands caused flooding in the impoverished and deforested country. Police in the Bahamas said a 66-year-old man died after falling from his roof in upscale Lyford Cay late Thursday while trying to repair a window shutter.

His office notes that "based on current forecasts, the eastern third of Virginia could experience tropical storm force winds for more than 48 hours, along with several inches of rain and coastal flooding." Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has canceled a rally in Virginia Beach Sunday night due to Hurricane Sandy, WAVY-TV reports. The official event listing does not indicate cancellation. Wind is a result of forces attempting to balance. As the pressure lowers in the center, the air spiraling around the eye must spin faster to offset the greater “slope” (gradient) of the pressure surface. My colleague Harry Enten may be known for analyzing political polls, but his first love is the weather. He'll be pitching in his latest look at Sandy shortly. Yesterday Harry wrote that "if there is one thing more unpredictable than politics, it's the weather," and "Where and how Sandy will make her mark is still very much up in the up air": The kicker here is that the jet stream, which carries weather systems across the country, is coming along at the perfect time and will block the eastward movement of Sandy [possibly forcing the storm into the coast]... Note how there is a wide range of uncertainty in Sandy's track. You should embrace that uncertainty because there is a large degree of unknown at this point. We don't know exactly how Sandy will interact with the jet. So that's why Sandy makes that strange dogleg in the National Hurricane Center forecast map we embedded in the intro. Blame it on the jet stream. Updated at 4.36pm BST 4.07pm BST Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage of the approach of Hurricane Sandy. At least 21 people died in the storm as it passed over Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti on Thursday, CNN reported. Sandy is currently just north of Grand Abaco Island in the Bahamas off the coast of Florida. The storm is moving slowly, about 6mph. Here's a summary of where things stand: •Meteorologists expect Sandy to make landfall, again, in the northeastern US early Tuesday as a tropical storm. The anticipated course of Hurricane Sandy, as of 11a.m. ET Friday, in a map from the National Hurricane Center. Photograph: NWS •Forecasters consider Sandy to be a particularly threatening storm for three main reasons. First, it is large, with tropical storm force winds currently extending outward 275 miles from the center and the wind field expected to grow. Second, it appears to be moving toward heavily populated areas. Third, its impact could be compounded by a potential intersection with a storm predicted to be moving out of the interior US toward the Atlantic coast early next week. •The last major storm to threaten the northeast coast was Hurricane Irene, which made landfall in Brooklyn, New York on 28 August 2011 and caused an estimated $15.8bn in damage, making it one of the costliest storms in history. The National Weather Service and other forecasters are watching Sandy closely. We'll bring you updates throughout the day.

Monday, October 29, 2012 Eye of Sandy Now Visible on Radar click to enlarge The eye of Sandy is now clearly visible on AccuWeather regional radar. It is moving toward the west northwest. The highest winds are around the west and north sides of the eye and the bands extending from the eye. The developing blizzard in the mountains is highlighted on our winterized radar.
Tidal gauge at The Battery showing the storm surge (green) lining up perfectly with the high tide (blue) to produce a massive storm tide (red) – National Data Buoy Center, NOAA. Also note that pressure bottomed out just above 960mb. A site at Sandy Hook, NJ stopped reporting before the peak storm surge/tide. Heavy rain combined with the storm tide on the Chesapeake and Delaware bays caused flooding in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The storm tide travelled up the Hudson river leading to record levels at Poughkeepsie. Rivers are still rising in response to the heavy rains from the storm still flowing into them. Heavy snow and (near) blizzard conditions are occurring the central Appalachian mountains and Ohio. Storm conditions are still occurring on the Great Lakes leading to very rough lake conditions and coastal flooding where onshore winds are producing 1-3ft water level rises. Damages from this hurricane will likely be astronomical in expense, mainly from the coastal flooding and power outages. In these coastal areas, many trees still had their leaves and so tree damage, power outages, and damage to homes from falling trees was the primary form of wind damage. Tree damage, power line damage, and roof damage from the weight of the snow, which was of a high water content, were the most common form of damage where feet of snow have fallen in the mountains. Meteorologically, this storm was significant because of its rare form of interaction with an extra-tropical system, its trajectory, its record breaking low landfall pressure of 946mb, and its size. A storm like this has immense potential to cause death and destruction and that it has indeed lived up to its potential. The name Sandy will likely be retired. Sandy’s forecast track has changed little over the last day. The hurricane is expected to continue northeast or north-northeastwards today. A turn to the north should commence this evening or tonight, and a turn to the northwest tomorrow morning. Landfall is expected in New Jersey Monday night. Further deepening of this system has occurred with pressures falling to 951mb. Sandy could either hold its own, or continue to deepen up until landfall. Impacts:Heavy Rain – Widespread areas of 3-8″ of rain with localized areas of >12″ of rain are likely along and to the left of this storm’s track as Sandy moves inland. This could lead to moderate-major river flooding in the Mid-Atlantic states. Near-coastal river flooding may be exacerbated by elevated tides. High Wind – Tropical Storm conditions have been reported in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and gusts over tropical storm force have been reported in Virginia. Damaging winds to hurricane force are expected to occur along the immediate coast and in gusts inland to near coastal cities. Tropical Storm force/gale force winds (>39mph) are expected to occur well inland with damaging gusts over 50mph common. This could cause severe tree damage or defoliation and lead to power outages or even structural damage as far inland as southern Ontario and Quebec. Storm Surge – A storm surge of 2-5ft is occurring along the North Carolina, Virginia, and Delmarva coasts, this could increase further as Hurricane Sandy continues an onshore flow in this area. Sound-side flooding is likely also occurring in Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. In Long Island sound and in New York Harbor, expect peak storm surges of 6-11ft. Anywhere else with onshore gale force winds can expect storm surges between 4 and 8ft. These are very serious heights above mean tide level and if combined with a high tide cycle, could produce disastrous coastal flooding and damage in a highly populated area. This storm surge will be accompanied by large battering waves that could produce erosion and additional structural damage. Records for storm surge values in this region could be threatened and the infrastructure in place put to the test. On the Great Lakes, the prospect of lake length winds on Lake Michigan have prompted lake shore flood watches to be posted in Illinois and Indiana. High surf and onshore gale force winds there could cause localized lake shore flooding there, a similar threat exists for Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Heavy Snow – In the middle Appalachians in West Virginia, a combination of tropical moisture, up sloping winds, and cold air filtering in on the west side of Sandy will mix to dump heavy wet snow and bring gusty winds. Near blizzard conditions are possible here and winter storm watches are in effect calling for 1-2 feet of snow in the highest elevations above 3000feet in altitude. 2-6″ are possible below 2000feet in altitude in West Virginia. In areas where deciduous trees still have leaves, the combination of snow and winds will produce significant tree damage that could lead to power outages, the weight of the snow may even lead to some roof damage. Bermuda Weather Service radar image of a squally shower of the west end of the island that possibly produced a tornado at around 9am local time. Bermuda: Bands of showers are expected to move through tonight and tomorrow. Squally showers in these bands could contain tropical storm force winds and tornadic activity is a distinct threat here. The Bermuda Weather Service expects 35-40mph southwesterly winds with gusts to 65mph late tonight – but this could be confined to the western marine area. Elevated surf along the south shore will produce dangerous rip currents and significant beach erosion, while making it hazardous to be out on the water. Why no tropical storm/hurricane warnings for the Northeast/New England? Hurricane Sandy could transition into a post-tropical storm as it approaches. If the storm is no longer tropical, tropical storm and hurricane warnings cannot be in effect for it. In the event this happens, all warnings would have to be switched to those used for mid-latitude extra-tropical storms which could lead to confusion among the public. So to avoid confusion, they are starting warnings off as those for extra-tropical storms.
U.S. 7 Fake Hurricane Sandy Photos You're Sharing on Social Media Fake Hurricane Sandy photos flew around Twitter and Facebook on Monday, as users shared jaw-dropping images. Unfortunately, the race to post the most striking pics has most folks skipping the all-important fact check. We've gathered up five "Hurricane Sandy" photographs that have spread on the social web, but weren't actually taken during the massive storm. Soldiers weather hurricane conditions at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The moving photo purporting to show soldiers standing guard at the Arlington National Cemetery monument during Hurricane Sandy quickly spread on the social web. But the Old Guard pointed out that the photo was actually a shot taken in September.

Hurricane Sandy Forces Google to Cancel Android Event The event was rumored to revolve around the launch of Android 4.2 "Key Lime Pie" and a 10-inch "Nexus 10" tablet running on the brand-new OS. However, it'll be at least a little longer before we see that Android update and tablet. Here's an email sent to Mashable by Google: "We are canceling our Monday morning event in New York due to Hurricane Sandy. We will let you know our plans as soon as we know more." Hurricane Sandy is a Category 1 storm that's currently moving north toward the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. While a hurricane is bad enough on its own, Sandy has the potential to combine with winter weather systems in a rare event meteorologists are calling "Frankenstorm." Mashable will let you know more about the Google event's scheduling as soon as we receive new details.

Read More Risks of Hurricane Sandy-like Surge Events Rising By Andrew Freedman Published: January 24th, 2013 The track of Hurricane Sandy was unprecedented in the historical record of North Atlantic Ocean Basin hurricanes, and its deadly storm surge — while exceedingly rare — is likely to become a more frequent event as the climate continues to warm due in large part to manmade greenhouse gas emissions. Those are the conclusions of a forthcoming study from researchers at NASA and Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Observatory. Timothy M. Hall, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, and Adam Sobel, a researcher at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Observatory, set out to investigate how common Hurricane Sandy’s impact angle was under static climate conditions. Given that global average temperatures are rising, their findings may support the idea that global warming helped influence the jet stream in ways that made the storm’s left turn more likely to occur. "... Either Sandy was an exceedingly rare storm, or our assumption of long-term average climate conditions is erroneous, and Sandy’s track was made more likely by climate change in a way that is yet to be fully determined," the study said. The study is undergoing peer review for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and was first reported by WNYC News. Other research has found that rapid Arctic warming, and the related loss of Arctic sea ice, is increasing the odds of such unusual weather patterns, and the study’s finding that Sandy’s track is so rare under long-term average climate conditions would support the argument that there may have been a climate change influence. In an interview with Climate Central, Hall said that much more research needs to be done in this area before reaching more definitive conclusions. “There are a lot of steps and chains of reasoning in that argument, each of which needs to be understood more fully,” he said. Hurricane Sandy, which was officially re-classified as a post-tropical storm shortly before landfall, caused heavy damage along the New Jersey shore, and caused the most extensive coastal flooding event in modern-day New York City. Much of the subway system in lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn flooded, along with transit stations in adjacent areas of New Jersey. The storm was responsible for killing at least 131 people, 48 in New York City alone, and it was the second-most expensive hurricane in U.S. history, behind Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The impact angle of Hurricane Sandy was its most unusual feature, ensuring the storm surge would case maximum damage, Hall said. The storm's left-hand turn put the most dangerous right-front quadrant on top of New Jersey and southeastern New York, pummeling these areas with an historic storm surge and record high waves. That, combined with astronomical high tides, led to record storm tide levels. Water rushes into the Hoboken, N.J. PATH station during the height of Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 29, 2012. Credit: The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The researchers used statistical techniques and computer modeling to simulate millions of “synthetic" tropical cyclones in the Atlantic in order to determine the likelihood of another storm making a Sandy-esque dramatic left hook toward the coast, striking the most heavily populated region of the U.S. at a nearly perpendicular angle. The study found that Sandy’s track stands alone in the historical record dating back to 1851, and that modeling simulations showed such a track is an event that would occur about once every 714 years. However, that does not mean that a storm like Sandy won’t affect New Jersey and New York for another 714 years, but rather that the average annual probability of another Hurricane Sandy occurring is .14 percent. That may seem low, but according to Hall and separate research published in Nature Climate Change in February of 2012, global warming-related sea level rise is likely to make destructive storm surges like Hurricane Sandy’s much more common in the next few decades, regardless of whether storms follow a path similar to Sandy. “We’re virtually guaranteed to get a foot or 2 feet of sea level rise within the next century,” Hall said, adding that this will have the effect of dramatically increasing the frequency of such rare and significant weather events, such as a Sandy-like storm surge. “[We are] Highly likely to get more frequent flooding like Sandy just due to sea level rise alone,” Hall said. The 2012 study by researchers at MIT and Princeton found that the combined effects of changes in storm intensity and tracks that may occur as a result of climate change could cause the present-day 100-year surge event in New York to occur once every 3 to 20 years by 2100, and the present day 500-year surge event to occur once every 25 to 240 years. That represents a significant escalation in storm surge risk, the study said. This graphic shows factors that contributed to the top 10 high-water events measured at New York’s Battery Park from 1900 to present. The water height for each event is shown here against the benchmark of mean lower low water averaged between 1983 and 2001. Sea level rise (about a foot since 1900) is depicted here as a component of storm surge. Although Sandy’s surge peaked close to high tide, other events had even higher tide levels.Click to enlarge the image.

Hurricane Sandy brought impacts that were actually worse than the 500-year surge event calculated by the 2012 study, since the combination of the storm surge and astronomical high tides caused the peak storm tide during Hurricane Sandy at The Battery in Lower Manhattan to reach about 4.23 meters above mean sea level. That was about 1 meter higher than the 500-year storm tide calculated for the 2012 study. By hitting the coast at a nearly perpendicular angle, Sandy brought its strongest winds and maximum storm surge to the New Jersey and New York coastlines. The storm surge was aided by the timing of high tide and the geographical features of the coastline, which tends to maximize the potential surge in certain areas depending on the wind direction, including New York Harbor. Typically, the tropical storms and hurricanes that strike the Northeast are pushed in a northeasterly direction by the prevailing upper level winds. That was the case, for example, with Hurricanes Gloria in 1985 and Bob in 1991. Those storms hit the coast at a grazing angle, and only areas of land that stick out into the ocean, such as Cape Hatteras, N.C., and Cape Cod, Mass., have a long history of experiencing storms that hit at a more perilous perpendicular angle.
We're over three weeks removed from Hurricane Sandy, and clean-up efforts from the extensive and debilitating flooding are still going on. Police are dealing with thousands of pieces of evidence in NYPD storage centers that were damaged, and the MTA is still clearing out some tunnels. Below, you can get another dramatic reminder of how bad the flooding was from this video of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel during the storm. It took almost two weeks to reopen the tunnel after the storm hit—it also caused some friction between MTA CEO and Chairman Joe Lhota and Mayor Bloomberg. Lhota had to apologize after he said Bloomberg “like an idiot” had made arbitrary predictions to reporters about when the tunnel might be open.

The Mets organization is already pitching in on the recovery effort by providing staging areas and base camps at Citi Field and the old Shea Stadium parking lots for Con Ed, FEMA, the New York National Guard, the city Office of Emergency Management, the Federal Incident Management Teams and mutual assistance electrical teams, as officials work to restore electricity, remove debris and provide emergency services to New Yorkers. David Handschuh/New York Daily News New Yorkers suffered terrible, dramatic loses in Hurricane Sandy. Cots are set up in the team's locker room and press box area and workers are being provided food by the team and its concession partner, ARAMARK. The Citi Field area is not a distribution center but the Mets have also made the facilities at their minor league complex on Coney Island - MCU Park - available and FEMA has set up a distribution center for food, water and other supplies there. According to Chris Miller, spokesman for the city Office of Emergency Management, the Mets immediately offered help for the recovery effort. "They've been very good partners and continue to be good to the city in our recovery efforts," said Miller. Other sponsors of the Daily News Hurricane Sandy Fund include Modell's Sporting Goods, Applebee's Restaurants and City Havest.

Hurricane Sandy Was New York's "Self-Inflicted Calamity" New York City has been turning tidal wetlands into urban development for centuries. In his new book Gotham Unbound, Ted Steinberg says Hurricane Sandy showed the peril of ignoring the city's true ecological footprint. After centuries of reclaiming land, paving wetlands and building on floodplains, the Greater New York metro area was returned to its natural footprint, at least temporarily, by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Beginning on Oct. 29, 2012, the sea paid a little visit to New York. In the space of just a few hours, Hurricane Sandy threw history into reverse, sabotaging several hundred years’ worth of hard-won and fabulously expensive reclamation. An hour southeast of Manhattan, Jones Beach, a once-swampy strip of barrier island raised 10 feet by urban planner Robert Moses in the ’20s, took a terrible beating. Crashing waves reduced the wooden boardwalk to splinters. Lifeguard shacks were tossed around like toys. Metal highway signs snapped, underpasses ﬂooded. The storm left such a powerful statement in its wake that even Donald Trump sat up and took notice. Hurricane Sandy put the kibosh on his plan for 86,000 square feet of development on the beach. Trump on the Ocean became Trump in the Ocean. Next door at Long Beach, water surged over the sand dunes holding back the sea and rose 5 to 10 feet high in the streets. Houses burned, and basements ﬁlled with sewage. “Redraft of the Castello Plan, New Amsterdam in 1660,” aligned with a Google Earth image of the same location, shows how much of lower Manhattan’s modern shoreline was underwater in the 17th century. From The Lionel Pincus & Princess Firyal Map Division, The New York Public Library So it went on westward down the shore: The storm threatened to turn the reclaimed land of Kennedy Airport back into mushy meadow muck; it put 15 feet of water in an AirTrain connector to a Delta Air Lines terminal. After centuries of being filled in or diverted, what was left of Coney Island Creek overﬂowed with such a vengeance that it nearly killed a group of city utility workers trapped by the rising waters. Floodwater gushed into the former marshlands along Brooklyn’s Gowanus Canal, coating the neighborhood in an oily sheen, mangling metal security doors and tearing down walls. In Staten Island, the storm’s impact was particularly deadly. Twenty-one people died in the borough, more than in the states of New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania combined. The carnage took place along the ﬂood-prone outwash plain on the south and east shores of the island, located at the crest of the New York Bight, where geography funneled the ocean’s angry waters. In the 19th century, this land was a desolate, tide-swept marsh. But then came its paving over in houses and roads. When Hurricane Sandy whipped through, the sea returned to the neighborhood. The death and destruction, however, have not slowed plans near the island’s ferry terminal to Manhattan for the world’s tallest Ferris wheel — replete with a 100-store outlet mall — to be built close to where the storm drove 30-foot-long dock pilings through the ground ﬂoor of an apartment complex. North along the onetime tidelands fronting the Hudson shore of Bergen Neck in New Jersey, the ocean breached seawalls and water poured into the streets of Hoboken and Jersey City. When the water receded from the backyard of one Jersey City home, it left its calling card: a brown watermark on a basketball-hoop backboard. Roughly half the city of Hoboken was ﬂooded, and when the storm surge peaked, 20,000 people found themselves completely surrounded by water. Before the 20th century, Hoboken had been an island, and so, brieﬂy, did it return to one. As went Hoboken, so went the southern tip of Manhattan. The hardest hit areas were where colonial governor John Montgomerie, in 1730, granted New York title to land that was, at the time, still underwater. What Montgomerie conveyed, Hurricane Sandy took away. The East River broke through a bulkhead and poured into the city, reclaiming the Lower East Side and other parts of southern Manhattan built on landﬁll. Hurricane Sandy’s storm surge inundated low-lying neighborhoods along much of New Jersey’s coast, as shown in this aerial photo taken by the U.S. Air Force during a New Jersey Army National Guard search and rescue mission on Oct. 30, 2012. AP Photo/U.S. Air Force, Master Sgt. Mark C. Olsen Not Just Nature Hurricane Sandy was, barometrically speaking, an extremely intense storm, though the 1938 Great New England Hurricane was likely more powerful. The wind ﬁeld (the extent of strong winds) was immense: three times Hurricane Katrina’s. Predictably, what seemed to impress those in power in the immediate wake of the tragedy was the sheer dominance of the natural world. President Barack Obama said, “All of us have been shocked by the force of Mother Nature.” The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, added, “This was a major, major assault by Mother Nature.” Discussing the loss of life, Mayor Michael Bloomberg pointed out that “sadly, nature is dangerous.” There is, of course, no denying the magnitude of this low-pressure system. Sandy caused the storm tide at the Battery, at the southern tip of Manhattan, to reach its highest level — 14.06 feet — since the start of record keeping at the site. What’s more, although ﬂood-insurance maps drawn by the federal government beginning in 1983 determined that 33 square miles of land in New York City remained at risk of a one-in-100-year ﬂood, Sandy resketched the maps and proved that, in fact, a remarkable 51 square miles of land — 17 percent of the city — was in jeopardy. And yet to interpret the calamity as an act of nature is to make it seem as if the disaster came out of nowhere. Invoking Mother Nature risked leaving the impression that the long history of land-making and building in the ﬂoodplain had little to do with the catastrophe. Simply put, this was a self-inﬂicted calamity. New York has been thumbing its nose at the ocean for over 300 years. The Dutch took some tentative steps into the ﬂoodplain of the East River back in the 17th century, but it was the English who invented a whole new form of property — land underwater — that allowed building to go forward in harm’s way. Still, it was only in the 19th century that the idea of New York as a limitless proposition led to the extensive development of coastal areas. That move came at the expense of the wetlands and mudﬂats that once safeguarded the shoreline and helped to mitigate the effects of storm surge. Just weeks before Sandy struck, geophysicist Klaus Jacob, who had been urging New York to deal more aggressively with the threat of natural hazards for a generation, noted that the city had been “extremely lucky.” He added that he was “disappointed that the political process hasn’t recognized that we’re playing Russian roulette.” The growth imperative — that is, the idea of New York as an inﬁnitely expanding entity in terms of its population, economy and relations with the land — drove relentless development at the expense of the sea. Cycle of Storms High-density life unfolded in New York during a period of relative quiescence in intense hurricane activity. An 1821 hurricane scored a direct hit on the city, producing an estimated 10- to 11-foot storm surge. While subsequent storms in 1893, 1903, 1938 and a spate in the early 1950s buffeted the region, the sporadic occurrence of hurricanes led the city to spend most of the 20th century planning for snowstorms and garden-variety ﬂoods. Not until 1960 did a storm comparable to the 1821 hurricane in terms of its effect on the tide strike the city. Hurricane Donna, which made landfall on Long Island and caused the wind to gust to 93 mph at LaGuardia Airport, raised water levels at the Battery to 13.3 feet, the second-highest level ever recorded at the site. The scale of the ﬂooding caused by Donna prompted consideration of a proposal to build hurricane barriers. While the idea was being mulled over, the surface of the sea cooled off. The climatic change at issue is known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a periodic cycle of warming and cooling of surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. During the warm phase of the cycle (coincident with the 1938 hurricane, the ﬂurry of storms in the 1950s and Hurricane Donna), there is an increased chance that weak storms will evolve into more intense hurricane systems. But after 1965, the cycle shifted into its cooler phase, working to insulate New York. The hurricanes that did make contact turned out to be relatively anemic. Interest in hurricane preparedness and protection waned as Hurricane Gloria in 1985 and Hurricane Bob in 1991 petered out as they neared New York. In 1999, the metropolitan area again escaped disaster when Hurricane Floyd, downgraded to a tropical storm as it reached the city, arrived at low tide. Floyd failed to inflict any signiﬁcant ﬂooding. Then the climate changed again. The warm phase of the AMO returned. In 2006, Max Mayﬁeld, the director of the National Hurricane Center, said, “It is not a question of if a major hurricane will strike the New York area, but when.” Typical of development throughout the Greater New York City area, land reclamation reduced New Jersey’s Meadowlands to a fraction of itself in little more than a century. Kellie Jaeger/Discover New York Exposed New York was not ready for such an eventuality. A 2008 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development examined the risk of exposure to coastal flooding caused by storm surge for 136 port cities around the world. Greater New York was among the four most vulnerable spots. (The other three were Miami, Osaka-Kobe in Japan and New Orleans.) And even though New York’s gross domestic product surpassed that of London, Tokyo and Amsterdam, its level of defense against coastal flooding lagged well behind. While the other three cities all had substantial protections in place to defend against at least a one-in-1,000-year storm, New York was shielded to just a tenth of that level. More worrisome still was a subsequent study examining the physics of hurricanes and storm surge. According to the study’s ﬁndings, Gotham’s risk of experiencing “a catastrophic coastal ﬂood event” was higher than had been thought. In trading in its tidal wetlands for land development, the city had denied itself a frontline defense that, if the sedimentary record is any guide, kept all but the most vicious ﬂooding at bay. Moral Lesson It is too early to tell how Sandy will shape the future of New York. Water was still sloshing around in the Battery Tunnel when the advocates for Gotham unbound spoke up in favor of yet more untrammeled growth. Vishaan Chakrabarti, director of Columbia’s Center for Urban Real Estate, an organization behind the idea to vastly expand lower Manhattan with yet more landﬁll, acknowledged that the promotion of waterfront development had put people into the path of danger. Still, he made clear his intention to foster more growth, holding up Dutch reclamation efforts as a model. “They really don’t treat the water in this eggshell kind of way that they do in the United States,” Chakrabarti remarked about the Dutch. “They reclaim the land, use dredging material, do a whole variety of things to reshape the shoreline, like we ﬁrst did when we were New Amsterdam.” To characterize as hesitant what has gone on in the way of wetland loss and land-making in Greater New York is, at best, a gross distortion of the historical record. Moreover, nothing the Dutch colonists did at New Amsterdam comes even remotely close to the transformation of land and water that has happened since the 19th century. And that is still happening at places such as Manhattan’s West Side, where Hurricane Sandy did nothing to dampen the spirits for a 26-acre real estate development called Hudson Yards, much of which is set to rise directly in the one-in-100-year ﬂoodplain. But New York’s ecological history should teach us a moral lesson. Namely, that port cities across the world — from Shanghai to Mumbai, Tokyo to Bangkok — need to preserve as much wetland and unfragmented open space as possible. There must be a less rigid and less militantly developmental approach to life on the edge of the ocean. We must even seriously entertain the idea of retreat. Those questing for more growth bear the burden of addressing a city’s true ecological footprint. There must be, in short, some owning up to the limits imposed by life in an estuary.
What made Hurricane Sandy’s impact so great? A week after hitting the Caribbean, Hurricane Sandy made landfall along the east coast of the US on Monday evening as a powerful storm. Worst fears have been realised, with 16 people killed, millions of homes without power, and road, rail and airline networks paralysed. Only last year, New York City and other parts of the eastern US were hit by Hurricane Irene, which left a trail of damage and disruption, estimated by NOAA to have cost $19bn. So what has made Hurricane Sandy’s impact so great? Size The size of Hurricane Sandy was truly phenomenal – something that can only be fully appreciated when looking at the storm on a satellite picture. Prior to making landfall, hurricane-force winds (sustained speed of 74mph and above) and tropical storm-force winds (sustained speed of 39-73mph) extended 175 miles and 485 miles from the centre of the storm respectively. According to NOAA, in a typical large hurricane, tropical storm-force winds would only reach out 300 miles from a storm’s centre. To put this into context, if the centre of hurricane Sandy was placed over Paris, the tropical-storm force winds would affect much of western Europe – as shown by the green circle on the map below. Track Sandy’s track has been crucial in terms of the impact that it has had. Normally, hurricanes that move along the east coast of the US are steered out across the Atlantic Ocean by the west to east movement of the jet stream. However, on this occasion, the jet stream was taking a more north to south track, having less of a steering effect on Sandy. In addition, there was a big area of high pressure to the north east of the US which effectively blocked Sandy from moving out into the Atlantic. As a result, the storm was forced to take a left turn, slamming into the east coast. Not only is this an unusual route for a hurricane to take, it is a route that put around 60 million people in its path. Storm surge and high tide As the storm made landfall, there was a major storm surge along coastal areas on its northern side caused by onshore hurricane-force winds pushing water onto the coastline. Also, with a full moon, high tides were occurring, which only added to the water levels along the shore. These factors combined to cause major coastal flooding – especially for low-lying areas. Battery Park, New York City had storm surges reaching a record-breaking 14ft, sending torrents of water into lower Manhattan. Damaging winds Hurricane-force winds lashed the coastline from New Jersey to Massachusetts where gusts of up to 90mph were experienced. This strength of wind came at a time of year when some trees are still in leaf. Leaves on trees act as sails and make them more prone to being blown down, as does heavy rain, softening the ground that holds their roots. Urban areas are even more prone to damage from strong winds because the layout of buildings can cause the wind to funnel between them, giving the wind an extra kick. Very tall buildings like skyscrapers would have experienced even stronger winds than those measured at ground level. This is because the wind blows even faster just a few hundred metres above the ground due to it experiencing less friction and flowing more freely. It is probable that the top of the Empire State building experienced wind gusts in the range of 120mph, if not a little more. Climate change? There’s no doubt that some will debate on whether climate change can be said to have had an influence on hurricane Sandy. However, it’s not wise or reasonable to use a single weather event when considering a changing climate. On the other hand, future predictions of a warmer world would allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture, which could equate to more significant rainfall events taking place. Also, warmer ocean waters could potentially give hurricanes a bigger playground in which to roam, as this is where they draw their energy from in order to thrive.

How many single catastrophic weather events would it take for you to “consider a changing climate” caused by human-generated greenhouse gases and continual global pollution? The problem with journalism like yours is that it keeps diverting people’s attention from the truth. Your article starts off very strong. But your summary sucks…and doesn’t show any journalistic strength. Thanks for your message, although I think that you’ve misunderstood my point. If you read it again, it’s making the point that Sandy would need to be considered amongst a range of storms in order to make any conclusions representative. When it comes to science or anything else being studied to evaluate a hypothesis, more than one case study would be examined to make it robust. Although this is a valid point, its not a case of ignoring global warming. We have had many similar climate events in the past and although many species get wiped out afterwards the biodiversity continues to climb higher than before. This suggests that climate change is a normal pattern in the long term life of our planet and trying to do anything to stop it is futile. The best we can do is learn how to handle such events like issuing warnings, evacuation orders and finding ways to cope in harsh climate conditions.Looking at how many people would have been killed in a similar event 100 years ago shows that we are very aware of our climate and are making rapid advances in our methods of coping with it. On the other hand, how many people get killed by motor vehicles every year compared to those killed by hurricanes still shows where the problems in human society lay. Basically, not with mother nature. Tom, the idea of humans contributing to global warming is still nothing but a theory. It is not certain. Let us look at the facts… The oceans contain 37,400 billion tons (GT) of suspended carbon, land biomass has 2000-3000 GT. The atmosphere contains 720 billion tons of CO2 and humans contribute only 6 GT additional load on this balance. The oceans, land and atmosphere exchange CO2 continuously so the additional load by humans is incredibly small. Now, even though our contribution may pale into insignificance compared to CO2 released naturally, it IS a possibility for our contribution to upset the balance of CO2 being naturally released and naturally absorbed. These 6 billion tons of extra CO2 are, for a fact, NOT being FULLY absorbed, thus leaving us with a few tons of CO2 floating in the atmosphere. Now, you might be thinking, so what am I getting at? Well, yes, there IS that man-made carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere every year. BUT, and this is a big BUT, it’s not even for certain, just like how the idea of ‘global warming’ is not certain, that CO2 ACTUALLY causes global warming on the scale for our tiny contribution to cause climate change. For example, water vapour, for a start, is far more influential on world temperatures than CO2 levels. I agree, why are people still wondering about climate change? The overwhelming opinion of peer-reviewed experts on climate change is agreed that climate change is happening and it is caused by humans. What I want to know is when will those affected start to sue climate change deniers, especially the oil companies, for damages. They are responsible, alongside the media who think the general public are gullible. We are not. ‘it’s not wise or reasonable to use a single weather event when considering a changing climate’ It’s even less wise to think climate change is selective switching on and of between individual weather events. It effects every weather event with greenhouse gasses emitted by us now part of the climate. Man proposes and God disposes!concret jungle.the high risers buildings are giving extra force to the hurricanes.the weather patern is rap.idly changing where all the new technology is failing .we will have to look for the old, conventional ways of merging with the nature, the five elements are the supreme power and we must accept and respect them. Liam thank you for your informative report that shed light on Hurricane Sandy, the size and impact it has created, and basically well founded facts that give the majority of ordinary people. like me, an idea of the scale of this event. Glad to know your report is aimed at us. Perhaps it is not scientifically accurate, but then so what, it drew a very good picture. Thanks Liam. Nice job! There are those who consider that the world actually stopped getting warmer a decade ago so. As Liam writes, one must look at a range of events to suggest that global warming alone is to blame. The earth goes through cycles – there was intense cold in the UK during the 1600s and we have been coming out of a cold spell since the end of the 1950s. Yes, there has definitely been an upsurge in physical phenomena recently – not one but several of the worst recorded storms in the UK have occurred in the past 20 years or so, the four of the ten worst earthquakes on record have occurred recently, the list is endless. One can look at the present sunspot cycle and ask if that has some bearing on the question. I don’t know. There has been talk of the end of the present Mayan epoch; American scientists have discovered that at the end of the last one (several thousand years ago) their location was hit by a very sudden mini ice-age. Who understands that? I cannot imagine it was the emissions of camp fires! For all our scientific discoveries we are still at the dawn of learning, tentatively exploring hypotheses. Perhaps the current century will see a definitive understanding of our planet; then and only then can we definitively answer yes or no to the global warming question but we cannot do so now. What we can do now is to use our current knowledge to control the emission of those gases which seem to contribute to making a warming blanket in the upper atmosphere, perhaps to try to contain and even use the methane being given off by the tundra as permafrost melts, reduce poisonous emissions from factories and other makeshift controls. As for the problems faced by the US eastern seaboard, one of the problems is that major urban centres are so close to the sea and their infrastructure is so susceptible to weather problems. As others have written, the far east experiences far worse typhoons regularly and are prepared. Is New York prepared for the western slope of Grand Canaria slipping into the sea? Perhaps they should make real contingency plans It was Liam’s blog post of Friday, reporting on how the hurricane was expected by the forecasters to make a sharp left turn and hit New Jersey or thereabouts (I was assuming till then that the storm would stay offshore and perhaps just produce snow on the east coast), which first alerted me to the seriousness of the situation. On Saturday evening I started a thread at the BBC Points of View message board commenting on how BBC TV News were already referring – understandably – to a ‘superstorm’ (I attached four links including Friday’s blog). However, as is sadly predictable, I was censored by the moderators for ‘discussing news and current affairs’. There has been talk today about how New York City seems to require something similar to the Thames Barrier. D Brown, these issues have been sorted out. Sunspot activity doesnt fit with the present warming. The only reasonable explanation is that we’re having an impact. Global warming has moved beyond hypothesis, its a theory and has a huge amount of corroborating evidence. David Higgins; it’s a matter of semantics. On the eastern side of the pond a theory is an idea with some evidence. A hypothesis is a fact proven by evidence until someone disproves it. For example Einstein’s Theory of Relativity seems to be hypothesis though some are questioning whether it is totally correct. A “certain fact” doesn’t exist in science; remember the Pope versus Galileo and Pope versus Copernicus. René De Beaumarchais ; it is a demonstration of a law “The Universe Doesn’t Care”. A human should and would be expected to apologise and refrain from a repetition but the Universe could do the same thing again next week and not care about the result – remember New Orleans. It doesnt matter which side of the pond youre on in scientific terms its the other way round to have you have it. A hypothesis is an idea to be tested a theory is a tested hypothesis with a hefty weight of evidence behind it. A theory is a strong statement with validity borne from testing/experiments. s grain consumption increased by 36,280,000 tonnes (40 million tons). Although everyone thought that their city or world would cease to exist, that was not the actuality. See how much of this change is attributed to greenhouse gases, albedo (i.
Hurricane Sandy Was New York's "Self-Inflicted Calamity" New York City has been turning tidal wetlands into urban development for centuries. In his new book Gotham Unbound, Ted Steinberg says Hurricane Sandy showed the peril of ignoring the city's true ecological footprint. After centuries of reclaiming land, paving wetlands and building on floodplains, the Greater New York metro area was returned to its natural footprint, at least temporarily, by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Beginning on Oct. 29, 2012, the sea paid a little visit to New York. In the space of just a few hours, Hurricane Sandy threw history into reverse, sabotaging several hundred years’ worth of hard-won and fabulously expensive reclamation. An hour southeast of Manhattan, Jones Beach, a once-swampy strip of barrier island raised 10 feet by urban planner Robert Moses in the ’20s, took a terrible beating. Crashing waves reduced the wooden boardwalk to splinters. Lifeguard shacks were tossed around like toys. Metal highway signs snapped, underpasses ﬂooded. The storm left such a powerful statement in its wake that even Donald Trump sat up and took notice. Hurricane Sandy put the kibosh on his plan for 86,000 square feet of development on the beach. Trump on the Ocean became Trump in the Ocean. Next door at Long Beach, water surged over the sand dunes holding back the sea and rose 5 to 10 feet high in the streets. Houses burned, and basements ﬁlled with sewage. “Redraft of the Castello Plan, New Amsterdam in 1660,” aligned with a Google Earth image of the same location, shows how much of lower Manhattan’s modern shoreline was underwater in the 17th century. From The Lionel Pincus & Princess Firyal Map Division, The New York Public Library So it went on westward down the shore: The storm threatened to turn the reclaimed land of Kennedy Airport back into mushy meadow muck; it put 15 feet of water in an AirTrain connector to a Delta Air Lines terminal. After centuries of being filled in or diverted, what was left of Coney Island Creek overﬂowed with such a vengeance that it nearly killed a group of city utility workers trapped by the rising waters. Floodwater gushed into the former marshlands along Brooklyn’s Gowanus Canal, coating the neighborhood in an oily sheen, mangling metal security doors and tearing down walls. In Staten Island, the storm’s impact was particularly deadly. Twenty-one people died in the borough, more than in the states of New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania combined. The carnage took place along the ﬂood-prone outwash plain on the south and east shores of the island, located at the crest of the New York Bight, where geography funneled the ocean’s angry waters. In the 19th century, this land was a desolate, tide-swept marsh. But then came its paving over in houses and roads. When Hurricane Sandy whipped through, the sea returned to the neighborhood. The death and destruction, however, have not slowed plans near the island’s ferry terminal to Manhattan for the world’s tallest Ferris wheel — replete with a 100-store outlet mall — to be built close to where the storm drove 30-foot-long dock pilings through the ground ﬂoor of an apartment complex. North along the onetime tidelands fronting the Hudson shore of Bergen Neck in New Jersey, the ocean breached seawalls and water poured into the streets of Hoboken and Jersey City. When the water receded from the backyard of one Jersey City home, it left its calling card: a brown watermark on a basketball-hoop backboard. Roughly half the city of Hoboken was ﬂooded, and when the storm surge peaked, 20,000 people found themselves completely surrounded by water. Before the 20th century, Hoboken had been an island, and so, brieﬂy, did it return to one. As went Hoboken, so went the southern tip of Manhattan. The hardest hit areas were where colonial governor John Montgomerie, in 1730, granted New York title to land that was, at the time, still underwater. What Montgomerie conveyed, Hurricane Sandy took away. The East River broke through a bulkhead and poured into the city, reclaiming the Lower East Side and other parts of southern Manhattan built on landﬁll. Hurricane Sandy’s storm surge inundated low-lying neighborhoods along much of New Jersey’s coast, as shown in this aerial photo taken by the U.S. Air Force during a New Jersey Army National Guard search and rescue mission on Oct. 30, 2012. AP Photo/U.S. Air Force, Master Sgt. Mark C. Olsen Not Just Nature Hurricane Sandy was, barometrically speaking, an extremely intense storm, though the 1938 Great New England Hurricane was likely more powerful. The wind ﬁeld (the extent of strong winds) was immense: three times Hurricane Katrina’s. Predictably, what seemed to impress those in power in the immediate wake of the tragedy was the sheer dominance of the natural world. President Barack Obama said, “All of us have been shocked by the force of Mother Nature.” The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, added, “This was a major, major assault by Mother Nature.” Discussing the loss of life, Mayor Michael Bloomberg pointed out that “sadly, nature is dangerous.” There is, of course, no denying the magnitude of this low-pressure system. Sandy caused the storm tide at the Battery, at the southern tip of Manhattan, to reach its highest level — 14.06 feet — since the start of record keeping at the site. What’s more, although ﬂood-insurance maps drawn by the federal government beginning in 1983 determined that 33 square miles of land in New York City remained at risk of a one-in-100-year ﬂood, Sandy resketched the maps and proved that, in fact, a remarkable 51 square miles of land — 17 percent of the city — was in jeopardy. And yet to interpret the calamity as an act of nature is to make it seem as if the disaster came out of nowhere. Invoking Mother Nature risked leaving the impression that the long history of land-making and building in the ﬂoodplain had little to do with the catastrophe. Simply put, this was a self-inﬂicted calamity. New York has been thumbing its nose at the ocean for over 300 years. The Dutch took some tentative steps into the ﬂoodplain of the East River back in the 17th century, but it was the English who invented a whole new form of property — land underwater — that allowed building to go forward in harm’s way. Still, it was only in the 19th century that the idea of New York as a limitless proposition led to the extensive development of coastal areas. That move came at the expense of the wetlands and mudﬂats that once safeguarded the shoreline and helped to mitigate the effects of storm surge. Just weeks before Sandy struck, geophysicist Klaus Jacob, who had been urging New York to deal more aggressively with the threat of natural hazards for a generation, noted that the city had been “extremely lucky.” He added that he was “disappointed that the political process hasn’t recognized that we’re playing Russian roulette.” The growth imperative — that is, the idea of New York as an inﬁnitely expanding entity in terms of its population, economy and relations with the land — drove relentless development at the expense of the sea. Cycle of Storms High-density life unfolded in New York during a period of relative quiescence in intense hurricane activity. An 1821 hurricane scored a direct hit on the city, producing an estimated 10- to 11-foot storm surge. While subsequent storms in 1893, 1903, 1938 and a spate in the early 1950s buffeted the region, the sporadic occurrence of hurricanes led the city to spend most of the 20th century planning for snowstorms and garden-variety ﬂoods. Not until 1960 did a storm comparable to the 1821 hurricane in terms of its effect on the tide strike the city. Hurricane Donna, which made landfall on Long Island and caused the wind to gust to 93 mph at LaGuardia Airport, raised water levels at the Battery to 13.3 feet, the second-highest level ever recorded at the site. The scale of the ﬂooding caused by Donna prompted consideration of a proposal to build hurricane barriers. While the idea was being mulled over, the surface of the sea cooled off. The climatic change at issue is known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a periodic cycle of warming and cooling of surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. During the warm phase of the cycle (coincident with the 1938 hurricane, the ﬂurry of storms in the 1950s and Hurricane Donna), there is an increased chance that weak storms will evolve into more intense hurricane systems. But after 1965, the cycle shifted into its cooler phase, working to insulate New York. The hurricanes that did make contact turned out to be relatively anemic. Interest in hurricane preparedness and protection waned as Hurricane Gloria in 1985 and Hurricane Bob in 1991 petered out as they neared New York. In 1999, the metropolitan area again escaped disaster when Hurricane Floyd, downgraded to a tropical storm as it reached the city, arrived at low tide. Floyd failed to inflict any signiﬁcant ﬂooding. Then the climate changed again. The warm phase of the AMO returned. In 2006, Max Mayﬁeld, the director of the National Hurricane Center, said, “It is not a question of if a major hurricane will strike the New York area, but when.” Typical of development throughout the Greater New York City area, land reclamation reduced New Jersey’s Meadowlands to a fraction of itself in little more than a century. Kellie Jaeger/Discover New York Exposed New York was not ready for such an eventuality. A 2008 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development examined the risk of exposure to coastal flooding caused by storm surge for 136 port cities around the world. Greater New York was among the four most vulnerable spots. (The other three were Miami, Osaka-Kobe in Japan and New Orleans.) And even though New York’s gross domestic product surpassed that of London, Tokyo and Amsterdam, its level of defense against coastal flooding lagged well behind. While the other three cities all had substantial protections in place to defend against at least a one-in-1,000-year storm, New York was shielded to just a tenth of that level. More worrisome still was a subsequent study examining the physics of hurricanes and storm surge. According to the study’s ﬁndings, Gotham’s risk of experiencing “a catastrophic coastal ﬂood event” was higher than had been thought. In trading in its tidal wetlands for land development, the city had denied itself a frontline defense that, if the sedimentary record is any guide, kept all but the most vicious ﬂooding at bay. Moral Lesson It is too early to tell how Sandy will shape the future of New York. Water was still sloshing around in the Battery Tunnel when the advocates for Gotham unbound spoke up in favor of yet more untrammeled growth. Vishaan Chakrabarti, director of Columbia’s Center for Urban Real Estate, an organization behind the idea to vastly expand lower Manhattan with yet more landﬁll, acknowledged that the promotion of waterfront development had put people into the path of danger. Still, he made clear his intention to foster more growth, holding up Dutch reclamation efforts as a model. “They really don’t treat the water in this eggshell kind of way that they do in the United States,” Chakrabarti remarked about the Dutch. “They reclaim the land, use dredging material, do a whole variety of things to reshape the shoreline, like we ﬁrst did when we were New Amsterdam.” To characterize as hesitant what has gone on in the way of wetland loss and land-making in Greater New York is, at best, a gross distortion of the historical record. Moreover, nothing the Dutch colonists did at New Amsterdam comes even remotely close to the transformation of land and water that has happened since the 19th century. And that is still happening at places such as Manhattan’s West Side, where Hurricane Sandy did nothing to dampen the spirits for a 26-acre real estate development called Hudson Yards, much of which is set to rise directly in the one-in-100-year ﬂoodplain. But New York’s ecological history should teach us a moral lesson. Namely, that port cities across the world — from Shanghai to Mumbai, Tokyo to Bangkok — need to preserve as much wetland and unfragmented open space as possible. There must be a less rigid and less militantly developmental approach to life on the edge of the ocean. We must even seriously entertain the idea of retreat. Those questing for more growth bear the burden of addressing a city’s true ecological footprint. There must be, in short, some owning up to the limits imposed by life in an estuary.

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Monday, October 29, 2012 Hurricane Sandy Moving In Here is the latest satellite image of Hurricane Sandy. She is strengthening and moving northwest. The pressure is 946 mb and has sustained winds of 85 mph. I expect Sandy to strengthen to 90-95 mph sustained winds with peak gusts to 100-110 mph. Winds on Long Island are now gusting to near 50 mph. They will only go up today. Here are some illustrations: Sandy at 2pm EDT The pressure is forecast to drop another two millibars as it moves WNW toward the New Jersey coast. Wind Gusts at 4pm EDT The scale is in knots. In order to get mph, you have to multiply by 1.15. So, 60 knots = 69 mph. 70 knots = 81 mph. 80 knots = 92 mph. The scale only goes up to 80 knots. Note the extreme winds in Long Island Sound as well as the New Jersey coast. Note also the gusts above 60 mph near the NC-VA border in the mountains as well as the increasing winds (gusts to near 50 mph from the north) over the Great Lakes. Forecast for 8pm EDT Note the winds are very high in the Washington, DC area. Increasingly high winds are forecast on the Great Lakes. Blizzard Orange equals blizzard warning, pink is a winter storm warning (something less than a 'blizzard' but still serious). Tides/Storm Surge Here is the latest tide gauge at The Battery NY where water is lapping on the Promenade. Note that the peak, so far, is 9.0'. The surge will increase the water level at least another 2.5' if forecasts are correct. Please read through the postings below for more on storm surge. That is the latest on Hurricane Sandy. I live in the greater Philadelphia region and my mind literally rejected the first image. I couldn't figure out what I was looking at until this morning--I kept looking for Florida and when I didn't see it, I just moved on to the next. Thanks for this very informative blog. It was very helpful.
The 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season is likely to feature a near-to-slightly-below average number of tropical storms, hurricanes and intense hurricanes, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said Thursday. Specifically, the agency, which runs the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, said there is a 70% chance that the hurricane season will see eight to 13 named storms (with sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or higher), three to six of which will strengthen into hurricanes (with sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or higher), and one to two hurricanes that will intensify into major storms, with sustained winds of 111 miles per hour or higher. The outlook calls for a 50% chance of a below-normal season, a 40% chance of a near-normal season, and just a 10% chance of an above-normal season. The hurricane season kicks off on June 1 and runs through November 30, although storms can form in the Atlantic during December too. The first is the expected development of El Niño conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which can act to increase atmospheric wind shear across the tropical Atlantic. Wind shear refers to winds that change direction or speed with height, or both, and developing tropical storms and hurricanes are sensitive to high amounts of wind shear, undergoing weakening trends when they encounter such conditions. El Niño can also increase the trade winds that blow from east to west across the tropical Atlantic, and make the atmosphere more stable, which limits the ability of tropical waves coming off of Africa to intensify into tropical storms or hurricanes. The second factor that suggests this hurricane season will be a below average one, in terms of the number of storms, is the sea surface temperatures in the area where such storms typically develop. In recent years, sea surface temperatures have been unusually mild across the Atlantic Ocean, but this year they are likely to be near to below average. Since hurricanes derive their energy from warm ocean waters, cooler seas can further dampen hurricane activity. NOAA unveiled the hurricane outlook at a press conference at New York City's Office of Emergency Management, in order to highlight advances in hurricane forecasting and warning communication that have taken place since Hurricane Sandy struck the region in October 2012. The National Weather Service (NWS), working with the National Ocean Service, which is another NOAA agency, plans to roll out storm surge inundation maps that will be updated every six hours beginning two days before a hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall. When Hurricane Sandy struck, storm surge information was only made available via text products, which subsequent research found confused many people and made it difficult to tell which parts of the city would be underwater. “Visual tools are critical,” said Holly Bamford, the director of the National Ocean Service. Since the storm, New York has established six hurricane evacuation zones that include about 3 million New Yorkers, according to Joseph F. Bruno, the commissioner of the city's Office of Emergency Management. Bruno told reporters that the new storm surge inundation maps can be overlaid on top of the evacuation zone maps to inform city officials of which areas will need to be evacuated ahead of a storm. In addition to the storm surge maps, the NWS is also working to roll out targeted storm surge warnings, which would be separate from hurricane watches and warnings, in 2015. Storm surge flooding typically kills more people than a hurricane's winds do. The agency has also been making upgrades to the computer models that help forecasters predict the track and intensity of hurricanes, according to NWS director Louis Uccellini. In the past two decades, meteorologists have made great strides in improving storm track forecasts, but intensity forecasts have lagged behind. The newly enhanced computer models, which have a higher resolution that can simulate small scale features such as a hurricane's eye wall, for example, may finally help make intensity forecasts more reliable, he said. In addition, the outlooks are often wrong. Last year, for example, NOAA projected that there would be an active to very active season, with between 13 and 20 named storms, and seven to 11 hurricanes. However, only 13 named storms occurred, just two of which became hurricanes, and none became major hurricanes. It turned out to be the least active Atlantic hurricane season in 30 years. NOAA experts and emergency management officials cautioned that it only takes one landfalling storm for a hurricane season to be remembered as a destructive one. "And even though we expect El Niño to suppress the number of storms this season, it's important to remember it takes only one land falling storm to cause a disaster," said NOAA administrator Kathryn Sullivan. There is one unscientific reason to believe that this year will see a major hurricane make landfall in the U.S. No major hurricane has struck the U.S. since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, which is a record 9-year run without such an intense storm hitting the coast. (Although it was extremely destructive, Hurricane Sandy was only a Category One storm when it approached the New Jersey Shore. Sandy had characteristics, such as its massive size, that made it have impacts similar to a much stronger hurricane, but it technically was not a "major" hurricane as defined on the official scale.)

A blog about weather, climate, and science. Occasionally, we'll post on other topics of interest. Thursday, October 25, 2012 Huge Storm to Affect Northeast Hurricane Sandy near Cat Island at 4:14pm CDT Introduction. There has never been a storm quite like this one in the era of modern modern meteorology (i.e., high-resolution computer models, aircraft data sensing, weather satellite temperature/humidity profiles), so we don't fully know whether our tools are up to the task. The Meteorology. Over the next few days, you may be hearing terms like "cold core, warm core, baroclinic, hybrid,"etc. This is important to meteorologists but not important to you. For the purposes of this blog, the storm is "Hurricane Sandy" regardless of its temperature structure aloft. The Comparisons. Yes, there are comparisons to be made to storms that occurred 74, 50, and ("The Perfect Storm") 21 years ago. The problem is that memories are not good with the earlier storms and the 1991 storm was far off the coast with few inland effects. So, I'd like to try a more meaningful set of comparisons: Wind. Think the June 29, 2012 derecho except over a larger geographic area with the potential for stronger gusts than occurred in that event. Yes, this means the potential for multi-state power failures. Coastal flooding. Given the full moon, the high winds and the storm surge, a storm surge to more than ten feet above mean sea level is likely -- and, perhaps, significantly higher than that. River flooding. See map below. While the exact path of the heaviest rain cannot yet be determined, major river flooding is possible to likely. Heavy wet snow. Yes, heavy wet snow is possible in the mountains of western Pennsylvania through West Virginia and western Virginia. There is even a chance the snow could extend farther south and east. Halloween 2011 brought major power failures from New Jersey to Connecticut with some places without power for three weeks. Got your attention? This issue now isn't as much what will occur but where. The center of Sandy should move inland somewhere between Norfolk and Providence. But, unlike most hurricanes where the strongest winds are concentrated within 10-25 miles of the eye, the wind field of this storm may be considerably more spread out. Here is the rainfall forecast. Again, don't concentrate on the locations as much as the amounts -- which are enough to cause major flooding. European model rainfall forecast via AccuWeather.com Pro web site 12Z GFS model So, if you live in these areas, what now? Here are my suggestions. The originals (black) were posted this morning. With the storm being more certain, I'm adding some (blue). Get prescriptions refilled now, especially if you doctor must approve the refill. Vote. If the stronger models are correct, power could still be out in some paces on election day. Regardless, that is one less thing you will need to do. The election will not (and shouldn't be) postponed. If you have considered getting a generator, now would be a good time to do it, but get started today (Thursday) so you have time to have an electrician do the installation. Generators should not be self-installed. If you don't have a generator, get a power inverter or two. Radio Shack and similar stores sell them. They are a "poor man's generator" and will keep your cell phone, laptop, and similar charged. Keep your car's gas tank full. If you have a wood-burning fireplace and you know your chimney is clear, get wood. Keep some indoors to keep it dry during the storm. You may need it to heat your home. If you live in a 100-year flood plain (you can check at city hall or your library) figure out your evacuation strategy now. Make your list of things you will take with you. Fill a few gas cans (the type you would use for your mower) to have extra in the event of power failures. Purchase extra staples. Without power, stores will be closed. Purchase booster batteries for your cell phone and other essential equipment. If you need insulin or other medicine that must be kept chilled make plans now. Addition at 11:50pm. Consider what you would do if you were without electricity for a month. If you have an invalid living with you that requires electricity, there will be areas that will be without for weeks. Be proactive. If you live in a heavily wooded area, does someone in your vicinity have a gasoline-powered chain saw? Does it have fuel and a reasonably good chain/blade? Test it, now. Get to an ATM. Without power, credit card readers and ATMs will not be working. In a disaster, cash is king. And, if you are planning to travel by air to or through airports between Richmond-Boston Monday through Tuesday Wednesday, forget it. Here is what you should do, now. Amtrak in the Northeast Corridor will likely have service interruptions. Outlook. In addition to the Hurricane Hunters, NOAA is going to fly its Gulfstream jet tonight to gather additional data around Sandy. This should enhance quality of the forecasts available tomorrow morning so we should be able to narrow down the areas to be affected as well as providing more specific forecasts of wind, rain, etc. ADDITION 6:15pm CDT. Here is the official NWS rainfall forecast out to 7pm EDT Tuesday. Some additional rain may occur after this time. 3 comments: One quibble. As noted in my post about possible election impacts, most of the states in the potentially impacted region do not have early voting. Specifically, the swing states of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia all don't, though I'm told Virginia's absentee ballot procedure is so lax that it's virtually a form of early voting. (I haven't verified that claim.) The only swing state in the region with early voting is Ohio. So folks there should definitely vote. Others need to hope for the best.

Share This Post Hurricane Sandy. Has any storm ever put more fear into the hearts of people? The storm caused more damage than any before it, with losses in the Billions, and personal losses that can’t be expressed. Why post radio coverage of a tragedy such as this? Several reasons. First, as with the media coverage of 9/11/01, these recordings represent history and belong in an online audio museum such as ours, just as the audio history of WW2, Vietnam, Korea, and even the comedic ‘Old Time Radio’ of the 1930s belongs. Some will say they can’t listen. Some will listen, but not until their lives are back to some sense of normality. Others will listen out of curiocity, living in places away from the damage and destruction. Whatever your feelings about this, I’ve decided to post as much coverage as I, your webmaster, recorded until my power went out at about 3:30 pm on Oct. 29, 2012, as the storm’s full fury unleashed itself on the Northeast. When you’re ready, begin with this, the first of our series of coverage of Hurricane Sandy. Our coverage begins with the afternoon news from WCBS 880 New York from Sunday 10/28/12 – the day before Hurricane Sandy made landfall in Southern New Jersey. Listen for the rundown of cancellations and mass transit shutdowns as Mayor Bloomberg got New York City ready for an onslaught never before seen in the Big Apple. Like this: LikeLoading...

Monday morning saw the beginning of my day in Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg, TN. I was driving home to go to work Tuesday Morning(so I thought). The trip was uneventful until about 60 miles out of Washington, DC.. By that time i was getting WTOP on my radio. The driving was tough, but slow. I heard how bad it was to the north uf us, and i was worried. when I opened my front door, there was a blast of warm air. My lights were still on!! Never lost them. However i feel badly for those to the north who lost them with some still not restored. I wish all in ‘Jersey and NYC the best and a speedy recovery. I see that really has yet to happen as of 11/4. I am sorry… M WCBS-AM 880 is good because they aired the entire storm effects in the suburbs damaged. WINS is more wooried about sandy’s effects in NYC I tended to hear “in the city” in WINS coverage. As of December 1st 2012 San Francisco is facing a wild storm that affects more in Mudslide areas and the Cliffs in Pacifica and KCBS 740 and 106.9 FM did a good job in airing the west coast storms.
