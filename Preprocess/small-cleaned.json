Updated at 1.09am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 12.41am EDT 00:41 As investigators piece together the background of Khalid Masood, reports are emerging about his past. Police have said that Masood was born in Kent on Christmas day 1964, and that this was not his birth name. Police have not commented on that, but according to the Press Association, a spokesman said he was known by a number of different names and research into them was continuing. As well as Kent, he was believed to have lived for some time in the West Midlands, where police raids took place after the attack in London. The Sun reports today that Masood spent the night before the attack at the Preston Park hotel in Brighton. Facebook Twitter Google plus 12.14am EDT 00:14 Theresa May said the right things this week, writes Martin Kettle. This consensual approach was the right course. It also allowed her to get some politically difficult information out into the public domain early and without provoking any blowback. Khalid Masood had been known to the authorities. But he was off the radar in the run-up to his act of terror. There was no prior intelligence of his readiness to act. When attacks like this happen people rally round. The popular wisdom is difficult to mistake in London this week. Newspapers that are too puffed up with their own importance, especially post-Brexit, got it badly wrong by trying to be divisive or demanding unspecified tough action. A politician who pretended to be Winston Churchill would get it wrong too. Andreea Cristea, a 29-year-old architect, was knocked into the Thames as Khalid Masood drove towards Parliament Square. She was plucked to safety when the crew on a passing boat saw her floating downstream. Staff on the Milennium Diamond used a boat hook to grab her clothing. She was then picked up by a rescue boat and treated by paramedics. Andreea Cristea. He halted the boat in order to hold her out of the water and stop her from being carried any further by the current. Her partner, Andrei Burnaz, suffered minor injuries. Unfortunately they were unlucky. Updated at 11.46pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 11.12pm EDT 23:12 Khalid Masood was a violent criminal convicted of multiple offences spanning 20 years, Robert Booth and Nazia Parveen report: His offences included assaults, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. He had spent time in jail but not for terrorist-related offences, according to Amber Rudd, the home secretary. He was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism, said Theresa May. Since then, there had been no intelligence to suggest his intent to mount a terrorist attack. Facebook Twitter Google plus 10.42pm EDT 22:42 Jason Burke The news that the London attacker was born in Britain and inspired by extremist Islamist ideology was entirely predictable, as was his criminal record. The standout detail from the sketchy profile we have of Khalid Masood is his age: 52, nearly twice that of most contemporary attackers. For the moment it simply underlines the variety of extremist profiles, and the unpredictability of the threat. Most Islamic militants have been between the ages of 18 and 35, with the average age declining in recent years. Some analysts see their attraction to radicalism as partly a generational rebellion. Violent rightwing militants tend to be much older. Thomas Mair, who killed MP Jo Cox last year, was 52. Every case is, of course, unique. And the reality is that, much as all politics is essentially local, so is terrorism. Islamic extremist strategists have wrestled with this challenge to their global vision for years, and have yet to evolve an adequate response. The One Nation leader tweeted after the attack, calling for people to pray for a ban on Muslims in Australia. Updated at 10.19pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 10.00pm EDT 22:00 Arrests latest Here is what we know so far about the arrests that have taken place since the terror attack: Eight people were arrested as a number of addresses were raided in London, Birmingham and elsewhere.

So it took me the best part of an hour to make sense of what I had seen. But the simple truth is this. Today I saw a man die. Possibly even this morning. It was about 2.50pm when a reporter from Bloomberg came running into the Guardian office in the House of Commons to say there had been an incident outside. I ran into the offices of the Daily Telegraph that overlook New Palace Yard to see two bodies lying near the entrance to Westminster Hall, just yards from where Airey Neave had been murdered nearly 40 years previously. I asked what had happened. Westminster attack: four confirmed dead including police officer and attacker - live Read more Armed police officers ran to the scene. Some started tending to the bodies; others stood around. Another man came running out. None of us did, we must have all been in shock. It later turned out he was Tobias Ellwood, a junior foreign minister whom we had all seen countless times before. Time stretched out as people began to do CPR on both bodies. Then after what felt like an age later, but can only have been a matter of minutes, there was the noise overhead of the air ambulance preparing to land in Parliament Square. Several armed police officers ran from New Palace Yard to talk to three paramedics dressed in yellow. The scene became more ordered, yet more urgent. They worked for several minutes, hoping for a miracle that never came. At some point one of the medics must have decided they had done all they could and they agreed to stop. They went to help those attending to the man who had been shot. Lines were put into him and further CPR administered. The man was taken away in an ambulance. A short while later the air ambulance took off, leaving only the dead policeman inside the parliamentary estate. His body was wrapped in a white bag on the cobbles where he had fallen. I went back to my desk, unsure of what to do. At various points in the afternoon, with the whole of the Houses of Parliament locked down, I returned to the window to see what was going on. It was as if I was somehow hoping that I could rewind time, that I could make what had happened unhappen. All rights reserved."}

By Ben Sellers Wikimedia Commons Print HTML N S Sign Up Get the New Statesman's Morning Call email. It seemed pure common sense, so at first I thought it was faux outrage. Now I realise that it is part of a deep dysfunction. We know that, until recently, the route into politics, on both sides, was fairly standard, a well-trodden path: a disproportionate number of MPs came from public schools, or elite universities, especially Oxbridge. To find it normal in any sense, you must have emerged from a very different reality. That different reality is the privileged bubble of the elite, as educated inside the cloisters of Oxbridge colleges and comfortingly expensive private schools. Reading the diaries, there is no evidence that their friendship extended much beyond Westminster. I doubt Caroline would have allowed it. I suppose we can only guess, but my own view is that, because he was from a privileged and politically pluralist background, Benn had learned the parliamentary game. None of that is friendship, at least not the way we conceive it. Close friends are people who you share your home with, your darkest secrets and most fanciful ideas. To many of us, friendships are permanent, binding contracts. Values do, but not formal politics. For people to confuse that and the kind of relationships we are offered in Parliament is absolutely bizarre. New Labour MPs, whether new or not, whether young or old, would slot into the expected culture a lot easier than those who come from the outside in, as it were. If the 2015 Labour intake included many people from outside the political bubble, then the 2017 intake took it one stage further. One of the most incredible consequences of the unexpectedly good result in June 2017 was the entry of a new generation of MPs, which almost accidently ended up being exactly what the Labour Party needed: MPs like Marsha de Cordova, Laura Smith and Ruth George, who are a huge breath of fresh air. Obviously, we should all expect political capital to be made out of any sense that the mould is being broken. There are many people in that place with a real interest in preserving the status quo. So the zealous right-wing press, licking its lips, helped by a strengthened hard right on the Tory benches, has attempted to portray this quiet revolution, this slow gathering of MPs who are truly representative of the population at large rather than a political establishment, as something sinister. The purveyors of hate almost betraying their fear in the process. And they have a deep interest in perpetuating these paper-thin, fake friendships of convenience. So, in some ways, this has been nothing more than a terrible miscommunication. Ben Sellers works for Laura Pidcock, Labour MP for North West Durham and shadow labour minister.

The dead officer was named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father. The attacker has not been named.

Analysis Image copyright PA Image caption A man believed to be the suspect received medical treatment, while two knives lie on the ground By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent The carnage on Westminster Bridge and inside the grounds of Parliament is the attack that security chiefs here in the UK have long been preparing for. Terrorism looks not just to kill and maim - but to create panic and such a sense of disorder that it rocks a city or nation to its foundations. And this attacker sought to do so in as low-tech way as is possible. The days when terrorism meant large, complex bombs and months of planning are gone: Western security agencies - particularly MI5 and its partner agencies - are very, very good at identifying those plots and disrupting them. The longer it takes to plan such an attack, the more people who are involved, the more chances there will be for security services to learn what is going on.

A loving son, brother and uncle. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. Dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will be deeply missed. We love him so much. His friends and family are shocked and devastated by his loss and ask that they are left to grieve alone in peace. Before the TSG, he was based in Bromley borough between 2002 and 2009. Keith was 48 and joined the Met in November 2001. He was married with a five-year-old daughter. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early. In his personal life he was a massive Charlton Athletic fan and had a season ticket. We will miss him so much. He was a fantastic member of staff and will be sorely missed.

Romek, 45, who has lived in Quayside in Winson Green for 12 years, confirmed she knew the London terrorist when she was shown a photograph of him on the stretcher. I have been so shocked by it all. They were a nice family, very reserved. He was very calm. I saw the photos on the TV and knew it was the man who lived here. He had a wife, a young Asian woman, and a small child who went to school. Romek said the family moved out a few months ago. The house is now occupied by new tenants. On Thursday afternoon a police van remained parked outside the white front door. He was a nice guy. I used to see him outside doing his garden. Never any trouble. Romek said the man and his family moved out around Christmas very suddenly and did not say goodbye. Describing the late-night raid, she said officers had swarmed the terraced mews house. I just heard a lot of banging and shouting. They were shouting to open the door. It was all a bit scary.

Masood was also known by a number of aliases, police said in a statement. Scotland Yard said Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack. However, he was known to police and had a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He had not been convicted for any terrorism offences.

At least five people have died after a knifeman mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge then stabbed a policeman in front of Parliament before being shot by armed officers. One witness said she saw an Asian man carrying an eight-inch knife heading towards the building. The man was on the floor with blood. We now know that one of them was sadly stabbed. Kathy Casatelli, 58, saw a car rammed into the front gates of the palace and a man being treated on the floor. It was a grey BMW, it looked like a nice car. The whole windshield was smashed. Police extended the cordon back up Broad Sanctuary beyond Westminster Abbey to the junction with Victoria Street. After the incident, Radoslaw Sikorski posted a video to Twitter purporting to show people lying injured in the road on Westminster Bridge. At least four people were seen lying on the ground, some bleeding heavily and apparently unconscious, on Westminster Bridge near Britain's parliament on Wednesday, Reuters photographs showed. One of the photographs showed a body lying under the wheels of a London bus. An assailant was shot outside parliament by armed police, the leader of the House of Commons said after loud bangs were heard with at least a dozen injured people on the nearby bridge. There are a lot of ambulances. I was coming down the escalators with loads of other people and police suddenly stopped us all. There was no way back up and it was a bottleneck. It was very scary. We're not sure if it was one or two attackers, or if it was the bloke in the 4x4 who attacked everyone on the bridge. Witness Quentin Letts said he saw a man in black attack a police officer outside Parliament before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the House of Commons. PA Scotland Yard are treating the incident as a terror attack The other officer ran to get help and the man in black ran about 15 yards towards the entrance. He initially thought it was a car crash but then he looked outside the window to a heavily-guarded area outside which is out of bounds to the public. Then we heard gunfire, lots of gunfire, maybe five or six rounds. Steve Voake, 55, was walking across the Westminster Bridge towards the South Bank when he saw the aftermath. He said he saw at least two bodies lying on the road and one in the water. Westminster underground station has been closed and pedestrians moved away from the scene. In the Commons, MP John Pugh says MPs are being evacuated from the building. Helicopters are circling overheard as officers at the scene say they are unable to confirm how long the cordon will be in place. Police have cordoned off the Mall to cars with officers seen in Trafalgar Square. It is being treated as a firearms incident. All rights reserved."}

Facebook Twitter Google plus 7.14am EDT 07:14 The Conservatives are heading for a landslide victory according to a string of recent polls. A poll of polls conducted in March by Electoral Calculus gives the Tories a 112-seat majority in Commons. It was based on more than 10,000 voters. A round of weekend polls made it look even better for May. Compared with the year running up to the 2015 general election, much less money has been raised by political parties over the past year, according to Electoral Commission records. Under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has become almost wholly reliant upon donations from trade unions and individual members. In contrast, the Tories rely on money from individual wealthy donors. Before the 2001 general election, there were no limits on what political parties could spend on national campaigns. Each party must ensure it abides by the spending limits in Great Britain. Separate limits apply in Northern Ireland. Here are the figures. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. Let's stand up for Scotland. More people are reading the Guardian than ever, but far fewer are paying for it.

But the speed with which he rushed to this judgement worried me. When violence of this nature erupts, we seek reassurance and return to established narratives. One such narrative widely prevalent today is that many British Muslims sympathise with acts like this and too few do enough to condemn them. In the likelihood of this narrative being further established, it is worth noting what the Muslim Council of Britain said yesterday straightaway or hearing the voice of New Horizons in British Islam: An attack on our democracy, the police, people on our streets, is an attack on our nation, on all of us. We condemn this act, an attack not just on the capital but on the values that people across Britain hold dear. Rowan Williams was a few yards from the World Trade Centre when the first plane hit.

All she would need would be a vote with a two-thirds majority in the Commons. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 provides for fixed days for polls for parliamentary general elections. The polling day for elections will ordinarily be the first Thursday in May every five years. The first such polling day will be on 7 May 2015. The Prime Minister will be able to defer, by statutory instrument, the polling day for such parliamentary general elections to a day not more than two months later than the scheduled polling day. The Act also makes provision to enable the holding of early parliamentary general elections. The trigger for such general elections would be either a vote of no confidence in the Government, following which the House of Commons did not pass a motion of confidence in a Government within 14 days, or a vote by at least two-thirds of all MPs in favour of an early election. Usually a signal that PM is making a party political statement... April 18, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus 5.46am EDT 05:46 If Theresa May is not going to announce an early election, it may be something equally big. There has also been speculation about May making an announcement relating to direct rule in Northern Ireland. But she has shown little interest in Northern Ireland affairs, and James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, would be expected to make an announcement of this kind. At the extreme this could even spark a reversal in the entire Brexit process. May would have to get parliament to agree to this but we know most MPs are positively brimming to head back to the polls to seek fresh mandates in the wake of the Brexit vote. The Tories have a thumping majority in the polls at the moment so the PM may just be gambling on significantly boosting her rather slender majority in Parliament. But right now, all the excitement in Downing Street is certainly weighing on the pound. They are not doing that, which increases the chances that it will be an election announcement. Facebook Twitter Google plus 5.39am EDT 05:39 Buckingham Palace has confirmed that the Queen is currently resident at Windsor Castle, my colleague Matthew Taylor reports. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act that was a consideration, because the prime minister had to see the Queen to call an election. Now that is no longer necessary, although David Cameron did call a courtesy call on the Queen before the 2015 election anyway. But, if there is going to be an election, May would have to have a vote in the Commons first to over-rule the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. - Five reason why she might, and 5 reasons why she might not Andrew Sparrow The surprise announcement that Theresa May is going to make a statement in Downing Street this morning has renewed speculation that she will call an early election. Five reasons why she might call an early election 1 - The polls, obviously. This was YouGov yesterday. April 17, 2017 And these figures may be even more important than the state of the party polling. April 17, 2017 And ComRes found an identical lead for the Tories over the weekend. April 15, 2017 2 - If May is going to call a surprise election, during the Brexit negotiations, now would be a good time to do it. May would be able to get the election out of way within about six weeks, which would not really interfere with the negotiations. The big advantage in having an election now is that during the negotiations she is almost certainly going to have to make compromises that will be unpalatable to hardline pro-leave voters and Tory MPs. If the election is in 2020, as it is meant to be, she may have to go to the polls explaining why the UK is still paying money to the EU, accepting European court of justice rulings etc. If she could win a majority now, she would be safe for another five years. 3 - Labour has said it would vote for an early election, meaning that May would have the two-thirds majority needed to bypass the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. 4 - The Crown Prosecution Service is due to make a decision quite soon about whether to charge Tories in relation to alleged over-spending at the general election in South Thanet and in other constituencies. An election now would eliminate the risk of prosecutions leading to byelections in these seats. He dithered over calling an election at a time when it would have suited him, but called it off at the last moment, having let public speculation get out of hand. May until now has firmly ruled out an election, meaning that if she called one now, it would come as a complete surprise. And five reasons why she might not 1 - Downing Street has firmly ruled out an early election quite recently. 3 - There is no evidence that the public want an early election. In fact, having had the referendum last year, people may be suffering from voting fatigue. And there is some evidence that voters punish politicians who haul them to the polls unnecessarily. 4 - There are already important elections planned for 4 May. It is too late to hold a general election then, and so a general election campaign would have to start after then. Voters would end up with two elections within two months.

Another witness said they had seen a person in the River Thames - a woman was later rescued from the water. The car then smashed into railings surrounding the Palace of Westminster, close to Big Ben in Parliament Square, where the attacker got out and stabbed a policeman. As he approached a second officer, he was shot by armed police. A video has emerged showing two officers pulling up outside the Houses of Parliament and then the sounds of three shots rings out. Three police officers are said to be among those injured in the attack and the French prime minister had confirmed that three French teenage students had also been hurt in the incident. Foreign Office minister and former army office Tobias Ellwood gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to one of the police officers injured in the knife attack in New Palace Yard, the cobbled courtyard in front of Parliament. Parliament was immediately shut down and the Prime Minister bundled into a car as officers searched the building, evacuating floors one by one. However, the evacuation was delayed after a suspicious package was found in a vehicle and the bomb squad were called in to deal with it. Staff in other buildings around Westminster were being asked by police to stay inside their offices and Parliament was suspended for the day. Sightseers on the London Eye were being held inside the viewing pods. An air ambulance landed in Parliament Square and medics were treating a number of people who had been injured in the incident, including the man who had been shot by police. Pictures showed a number of people lying in the road on the bridge, another image showed a man lying bleeding at the foot of stairs next to the Parliament building. At least 10 people were treated on Westminster Bridge and a number of London hospitals had been put on alert, London Ambulance Service said. He said he could see a vehicle on the other side of the road which had crashed into some railings. I walked on a few paces further and saw what I assumed to be either a pedestrian or a cyclist who had clearly been hit and wasn't moving, although he did then gently move. The man was on the floor with blood. One of the key witnesses to the attack was the Acting Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. He was unable to make a statement because he was giving vital evidence to officers. The Government has said it will chair a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee later today. Buckingham Palace declined to comment about its security arrangements but it was clear some precautions had been taken as the gates, patrolled by armed police, had been closed. MSPs have delayed a vote on a possible second independence referendum in light of the attack.

Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said Westminster was a sombre place in the wake of the loss of a member of the parliamentary family. This was an attack on Parliament for a reason. A sombre calm hung over Westminster the morning after the attack. There were none of the large groups of tourists usually seen taking photos outside Big Ben.

The officer was Pc Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old husband and father with 15 years of police service. A minute's silence was held at 9.33am to honour Palmer, whose police shoulder number was 933. Ten people have been arrested and six addresses raided across London, Birmingham and elsewhere. One person has been released on police bail. The woman was killed on Westminster Bridge as a number of pedestrians were mowed down by a grey Hyundai i40. It is believed the man was also killed in the incident on the bridge. Seven people are in a critical condition, and 29 have been treated in hospital. The attacker, has been named as Khalid Masood by police, although he used several alias. Armed with two large knives, he jumped out of the car after smashing it into the railings encircling the Palace of Westminster, fatally stabbing Pc Palmer as he entered the grounds.

While some development is possible within sharia-law, not every kind of change would be acceptable -- for example, the change must not be contrary to the basic teachings and objectives in Islam. Under Islamic law, injunctions laid down in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (Muhammad's way of life, as transmitted in traditional reports of his words, actions and approvals) cannot be changed by any human agency. Though Islamic law makes allowances for an individual Muslim's circumstances (e.g being in environments unsupported of Islamic law), the only way to 'change' such rulings found in mainstream orthodox Islam as the mandate for caliphate, offensive jihad, and pressing forward for world domination under Islamic law, is to leave Islam or to become a Muslim who rejects the binding nature of these laws (and for some Muslims that, too, equates, with apostasy): the law has painted them into a corner. As for subsequent times, there are two possible states in respect to non-Muslims.

Related Articles Analysis: Young, British and part of al-Qa'eda 06 Nov 2007 Muslim converts bear a heavy cross 09 Dec 2007 Britain has become a 'Catholic country' 23 Dec 2007 Cardinal calls for Britain to embrace immigrants 25 Dec 2007 Michael Nazir-Ali: Extremism has flourished as Britain lost Christianity 06 Jan 2008 Oxford Muslims want call to prayer 06 Jan 2008 Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Bishop Nazir-Ali compares the threat to the use of intimidation by the far-Right, and says that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Christianity to be the nation's public religion in a multifaith, multicultural society. His comments come as a poll of the General Synod - the Church's parliament - shows that its senior leaders, including bishops, also believe that Britain is being damaged by large-scale immigration. Bishop Nazir-Ali, who was born in Pakistan, gives warning that attempts are being made to give Britain an increasingly Islamic character by introducing the call to prayer and wider use of sharia law, a legal system based on the Koran. In the Synod survey, to be published this week, bishops, senior clergy and influential churchgoers said that an increasingly multi-faith society threatens the country's Christian heritage and blamed the divisions on the Government's failure to integrate immigrants into their communities. It found that more than one in three believe that a mass influx of people of other faiths is diluting the Christian nature of Britain and only a quarter feel that they have been integrated into society. The overwhelming majority - 80 per cent - said that the Government has not upheld the place of religion in public life and up to 63 per cent fear that the Church will be disestablished within a generation, breaking a bond that has existed between the Church and State since the Reformation. Calls for disestablishment have grown following research showing that attendance at Mass has overtaken the number of worshippers at Church of England Sunday services. Bishop Nazir-Ali, whose father converted from Islam to Catholicism, was criticised by Ibrahim Mogra, of the Muslim Council of Britain. We wouldn't allow 'no-go' areas to happen. But the Bishop's concerns are shared by other members of the General Synod. The Rt Rev Nicholas Reade, the Bishop of Blackburn, which has a large Muslim community, said that it was increasingly difficult for Christians to share their faith in areas where there was a high proportion of immigrants of other faiths. He believes that increasing pressure will be put on the Government to begin the process of disestablishment and end the preferential status given to the Church of England. Gordon Brown relinquished Downing Street's involvement in appointing bishops in one of his first facts as Prime Minister - a move viewed by some as a significant step towards disestablishment. The Government's confused and counter-productive approach risks creating a number of closed societies instead of one open, cohesive one."}

The final global body count after the month-long rampage was 421 dead and 729 wounded.

A marked police van is parked outside the store next to a bus stop with a number of uniformed officers guarding the cordon. He said a number of men appeared to work there but had never come into his shop to buy anything. Mr Gibbs said he had recognised the face of suicide bomber Abedi from the television.

We have to be unequivocal that no amount of excuses, no amount of twisted reasoning about a foreign policy here or a foreign policy there can be an excuse. Control orders restricted the freedom of terrorism suspects and could be used to force people to move or restrict their use of phones and computers. But they were abolished by the coalition government in 2012 amid concerns over their impact on civil liberties. Although they were criticised for breaching civil liberties, in fact they were upheld by the courts, every control order was subject to automatic review by senior judges. Lord Carlile was previously a Liberal Democrat peer but quit the party given its stance on security issues. 9:00AM Pictures: Police raid barbershop after smashing open shutters A police cordon is in place around the Fade Away barbershop in Princess Road, Moss Side, after a police raid early today.

The following day he visited the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester, where he was caught on CCTV buying a Karrimor rucksack. It is believed he then spent the weekend putting together the main components of the device, including the detonator. On Monday he then travelled the three miles from his home in Elsmore Road in the Fallowfield district to a rented apartment in Granby Row on the edge of Manchester's Gay Village. The building was raided by special forces at lunchtime on Wednesdayand specialist forensics teams and bomb squad operatives were still at the building on Thursday. Former Metropolitan Police officer, David Videcette, who helped investigate the tube bombings said it was likely Abedi had spent many months abroad practising how to assemble a device before returning to the UK. He will have spent time at a camp somewhere, possibly in Libya, being shown how to do it.

We've been hearing overnight that counter-terror police have carried out new raids in connection with the attack, searching addresses in Manchester and Merseyside. One man was arrested in the Moss Side area of Manchester in the early hours of Friday morning and detectives searched a property in St Helens. Eight men are in custody in connection with Monday's atrocity, with police and security agencies working at pace amid fears of further attacks. Police raided a house in the Withington area Credit: David Rose for The Telegraph Meanwhile, it is has emerged that police fear the Manchester bomber might have built a second device that is now in the hands of fellow jihadists. Officers who raided the home of Salman Abedi discovered a working bomb factory with a huge stash of explosive chemicals and other components. Security sources now believe that Abedi assembled the bomb himself after learning his trade in Libya. But the amount of material in his home has led to fears that he could have built more than one device and and distributed them to other British-based extremists. Salman Abedi, pictured left putting his bins out and right in CCTV footage shortly before the attack, is now thought to have assembled the bomb himself after learning his trade in Libya Meanwhile, with the General Election campaign due to resume on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn has signalled his intention to bring the issue of terrorism into the political arena. The Labour leader is expected to make a veiled attack on the Conservatives for underfunding the police service at a time of heightened threat, while linking Britain's overseas military campaigns with terrorism at home. Abedi, who was known to security services for his radical views, was said to have been in close contact with family members moments before slaughtering concert-goers on Monday. When and where raids have taken place A relative of the 22-year-old said he had felt increasing frustration at his treatment in the UK, heightened after a friend was fatally knifed in what he perceived to be a religious hate crime. Music fans were targeted at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in the worst terrorist attack on British soil since the July 7 bombing in London in 2005. As Abedi's route to mass murder continued to be probed: Downing Street announced the Government's emergency Cobra committee will meet in Whitehall on Friday morning to discuss the latest developments, chaired by the Home Secretary. Officers also carried out searches at properties in Manchester, Wigan and Nuneaton. British investigative efforts remained focused on smashing the potential terror ring which may have assisted Abedi, despite the belief of Libyan authorities that he acted alone. Twenty-three people remained in critical care across eight hospitals. They included five children at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. British Transport Police announced that specialist firearms officers are to patrol on trains nationwide for the first time. A man and a woman arrested as part of the probe were released without charge. At the Nato summit in Brussels, Theresa May confronted Donald Trump with her concerns about security lapses which allowed crucial evidence to be handed to US journalists by his officials. Emergency services on the night and aftermath of the Manchester attack were criticised by the widower of one victim, who accused them of leaving families in the dark. We've noticed you're adblocking.

Up to 40 people were injured when a lone terrorist attacked Westminster, stabbing a police officer to death as he tried to storm parliament, and killing three members of the public as he careered through the heart of the capital in a 4x4 vehicle. The attacker was among those killed in the first mass-casualty terrorist attack on Britain in over a decade. The Commons and Lords were locked down for several hours because of fears of further attacks. PC Keith Palmer. He was married with children and had been a police officer for 15 years. People fled for their lives as a Hyundai 4x4 driven by the terrorist at about 2.40pm indiscriminately ran into people on Westminster Bridge. The use of the vehicle to attack civilians was a direct copy of an Islamic State tactic used previously with murderous effect in Nice and Berlin. The vehicle then careered off the road on to pavement a few metres away from Big Ben and the attacker tried to storm parliament armed with a knife. The attacker, dressed in black, was shot by another armed officer and died of his injuries. The attacker was already known to counter-terrorism officials. Police chiefs have ordered extra officers, armed and unarmed, on to the streets of the capital. Keeping the national terrorism threat level at severe means an attack is feared to be highly likely but there is no intelligence a specific plot is imminent. They were alerted to the incident by the sound of shots being fired. Rob Lyon, 34, from Rugby, was walking along Westminster Bridge with a colleague when he saw a 4x4 vehicle travelling at high speed, hitting pedestrians. A colleague I was with, James, I heard him sort of shout. I instinctively jumped off the pavement. I could see people being hit. A woman was pulled alive from the Thames with serious injuries after having fallen into the water during the attack. The car then sped towards the Palace of Westminster, and came to a halt on the pavement, up against railings to the north of New Palace Yard, the green space adjacent to Big Ben, opposite an entrance to Westminster tube station. A man with a knife was then seen running through the gates of the Palace of Westminster, across New Palace Yard and stabbing a police officer. The attacker continued his rampage, targeting a second officer, according to witnesses. But he was shot by police as he approached, knife in hand. Witness Rick Longley said he saw the car crash into the railings and a man leaping out. UK terror attacks since 11 September 2001 Read more In the aftermath of the attack, Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood helped treat the injured officer, unsuccessfully trying to resuscitate him. The Bournemouth MP, a former soldier, was pictured with blood on his forehead, helping the police officer in Parliament Square. Two people could be seen lying within New Palace Yard, immediately outside Westminster Hall. The sitting in the House of Commons was suspended while police officers sealed off the area. Parliamentary staff were told to stay in their offices. Minutes after the incident, an air ambulance landed in Parliament Square, as sirens were heard outside, but the officer could not be saved. Up to 1,000 people were evacuated at various locations, including Westminster Abbey. It took several hours for parliament to be evacuated. The ambulance service said eight of those injured were treated at the scene. We pay tribute, too, to the police and emergency services who handled this with bravery.

He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. He was among those who died near parliament on Wednesday. Your Image was too big. Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. Three civilians, Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, and a police officer, Keith Palmer, have been identified as his victims. 27. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. Police released a picture of him on Friday. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and detained under the Terrorism Act was released on Sunday, Met police said in a statement. Eleven other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have also been released with no further action. The inquest into the death of Khalid Masood was adjourned on Thursday and a pre-inquest review has been set by the coroner for May 19. In all, Khalid Masood killed four people and injured more than 30 others in the March 22 attack before he was shot dead. One other person remains hospitalized in critical condition. Masood's cause of death was revealed Thursday in Westminster coroner's court, the Associated Press reported. Masood, 52, drove a car across Parliament Bridge, injuring scores of people, before crashing the vehicle into railings at the side of the houses of parliament. He then assaulted police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries, before being shot dead by officers on the scene. In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. That understanding may have died with him. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. There was nothing more you could have done. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. Authorities believe he acted alone. The 27-year-old man arrested late on Thursday in Birmingham was told he would face no further action. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London and bailed until the end of this month has also been released with no further action. As well as the six people released from custody last night, a 35-year-old man has been released with no further police action, and a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until the end of the month. Both were arrested in Manchester. Meanwhile, two men remain in custody: a 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham on Thursday morning, and a 28-year-old man arrested later in the day at a separate address in the city. They are being detained under the Terrorism Act 2000. One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. She is due to return to police until a date later this month. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Here's everything we know about him. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Read more about what we know so far here. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Read more about Masood here. The man had been in a hospital, and he was taken off life support. The man, who was not named, was one of two people who suffered life-threatening injuries in the attack. Around 23 people were injured in Wednesday's attack, and several were in critical condition. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Read more here. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Nothing to do with immigration. Read more here. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. Please continue to pray for our family. US president Donald Trump tweeted his condolences. My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. Many of the tributes included messages of condolence for PC Keith Palmer, the 48-year-old officer who died after he was stabbed outside the houses of parliament. Read more here. Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. No act of terror can shake the strength and resilience of our British ally. The very heart of the city has been struck. And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. The embassy said he had suffered a knee injury but has been discharged from hospital and that it is in contact with both their families. Read more here. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. Read more here. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Lords and MPs such as Tory MP Dominic Grieve, pictured here dodging some police tape, carried on regardless on Thursday. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. Read more here. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. Read more here. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. He has now been discharged from hospital. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Read more here. The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. Rowley also added that police understood Muslim communities might feel anxious, given previous actions by extreme right-wing groups following terrorist attacks. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Read more here. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The New York Daily News issued a correction after publishing the wrong name and photo. Investigators are treating it as terrorism, he reiterated, and the city will see an increased presence of armed and unarmed police starting immediately. They said the information was coming from colleagues in London. In fact, the image is from a 2013 incident when a man with a knife was tasered outside Buckingham Palace. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. But I know that the whole country will be thinking and praying for those who are affected, as I am. This is an ongoing incident and the Government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. Values symbolised by the Houses of Parliament. Six males and two females. Care is still ongoing. White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also released a statement in the form of a video on Twitter. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. He was pictured surrounded by medics and police officers giving CPR. Read more here. He said a police officer was among the dead, as well as a man believed to be an attacker. At least 20 people were injured. The number of those injured has not been confirmed. I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks. She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. Eyewitnesses, as well as social media accounts, appear to indicate a number of people were seriously hurt on Westminster Bridge. Earlier, a Reuters photographer, Toby Melville, published pictures of four individuals with injuries on the bridge. The Metropolitan Police Service is dealing with the incident and an urgent investigation is underway. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. I and my staff are safe and currently under lock down. This incident has not been separately confirmed by the Metropolitan police. Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. Emergency services are attempting to revive one individual lying down on the pavement on Parliament Street, some way away from the entrance to the building. Approximately a dozen armed police ran into the building shortly after 3pm."}

The attacks on the tube and a bus by four suicide bombers on 7 July 2005 were relatively sophisticated; the bombers had been commissioned and trained by al-Qaida and their actions carefully choreographed. The crudity of the Westminster attack is of a piece with much recent Islamist violence in Europe. There are certainly co-ordinated, well-planned operations, such as the slaughter on the streets of Paris in November 2015, in which 130 people lost their lives, and that in Brussels, a year to the day before the Westminster attack. Increasingly, though, jihadi violence involves individuals, without access to semtex or AK-47s, but with a desire to cause bloody turmoil. Low-tech terrorists driving vehicles into pedestrians is becoming more common, such as the assault on a Christmas market in Berlin last December, or, most horrifically, the truck attack on Bastille Day revellers in Nice last year. The day after the Westminster horror, a similar attack, in which a man tried to drive a car into a crowd, was foiled in Antwerp. Knife attacks, too, are becoming a common feature of low-tech terrorism, from the beheading of Lee Rigby on the streets of south London in 2013 by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, to the wounding in 2015 of three people in Leytonstone tube station in east London when 29-year-old Muhaydin Mire, ran amok with a knife, apparently as some form of deluded response to the war in Syria, to the murder last year of a priest, Father Jacques Hamel, in a church in Saint Etienne-du-Rouvray, in northern France by two teenage Islamists, Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean. What such attacks expose is the continuing degeneration of Islamist terror and the increasingly blurred lines between ideological violence and sociopathic rage. Last August, Zakaria Bulhan, a 19-year-old Norwegian of Somali descent, went on a rampage in Russell Square in London, stabbing six people, one of whom died from her injuries. It was originally seen as a terrorist incident. Later, Bulhan was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Last month, a court ordered him to be detained indefinitely in Broadmoor maximum security hospital. That, too, was first regarded as a terrorist incident, only later as the actions of a mentally disturbed man. In both cases, many refused to believe that these were not terrorist incidents and social media spawned dark conspiracy theories of official cover-ups. Such theories may be irrational, but they reflect, too, the difficulty, often, in drawing a distinction between jihadi violence and the fury of disturbed minds. Facebook Twitter Pinterest James Harris Jackson appears in court last week accused of killing a black man on the streets of New York. What has been less discussed is the changing character of terrorism from the IRA to Islamic State. And, whatever one thinks of such groups, those activities were governed by certain norms and contained a rational kernel. Many civilians were certainly killed through IRA violence, but, unlike jihadis, the starting point of the IRA was not the mere killing of random individuals. It is the arbitrariness of jihadist violence, and its disregard for any moral bounds, that can make it seem so terrifying. Whether Masood had any real links to Isis remains unclear. Deranged fury cloaked in ideological rage is not uniquely Islamist. Two days before Masood mowed down his victims on Westminster Bridge, James Harris Jackson allegedly stabbed to death Timothy Caughman in Manhattan. Jackson was white, Caughman black. Jackson is said to have come to New York from Baltimore armed with a knife and a sword and with the aim of killing as many black people as possible. The police are uncertain whether Jackson had any formal links to racist groups. But, as with many Islamist killings, this stabbing blurs the line between ideological violence and psychotic rage. This murderous act is not an isolated incident. In 2015, Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old American obsessed with white supremacist ideas, shot dead nine African-American worshippers in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Last July, Ali David Sonboly went on a rampage in a Munich shopping mall, shooting dead nine people, and injuring another 36. He was of Iranian origin. He was obsessed by mass shootings and lauded Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian neo-Nazi. A month earlier, in Britain, Thomas Mair, a 53-year-old man with links to far-right groups, had shot and stabbed to death Jo Cox, a Labour MP, while she was campaigning in the EU referendum, in Birstall, Yorkshire. All this exposes both how the character of ideological violence has degenerated and how rage has become a feature of public life. The social and moral boundaries that act as firewalls against such behaviour have weakened. Western societies have become socially atomised. The influence of institutions that once helped socialise individuals and inculcate them with a sense of obligation to others, from the church to trade unions, has declined. So has that of progressive movements that gave social grievance a political form. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dylann Roof appears at a hearing in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. From another perspective, however, we have to accept that because such attacks are low-tech, they are more difficult to prevent. This raises questions about how the authorities, the media and the public should react to such events. The authorities need to gather information on perpetrators and ensure public safety. But what the past week has shown is the need to reset the balance between pursuing such aims and giving exaggerated weight to the attack. While low-tech terror may become more common, we need to maintain a sense of perspective. The Westminster attack, like similar ones before it, reveals how easy it is to cause mayhem and disruption in an open, urban, society. But it should also remind us that, given how easy it is to sow terror, these kinds of attacks are relatively infrequent, even allowing for the fact that many are prevented before they come to fruition. Most people have access to cars and knives. All rights reserved."}

He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. He was among those who died near parliament on Wednesday. Your Image was too big. Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. Three civilians, Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, and a police officer, Keith Palmer, have been identified as his victims. 27. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. Police released a picture of him on Friday. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and detained under the Terrorism Act was released on Sunday, Met police said in a statement. Eleven other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have also been released with no further action. The inquest into the death of Khalid Masood was adjourned on Thursday and a pre-inquest review has been set by the coroner for May 19. In all, Khalid Masood killed four people and injured more than 30 others in the March 22 attack before he was shot dead. One other person remains hospitalized in critical condition. Masood's cause of death was revealed Thursday in Westminster coroner's court, the Associated Press reported. Masood, 52, drove a car across Parliament Bridge, injuring scores of people, before crashing the vehicle into railings at the side of the houses of parliament. He then assaulted police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries, before being shot dead by officers on the scene. In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. That understanding may have died with him. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. There was nothing more you could have done. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. Authorities believe he acted alone. The 27-year-old man arrested late on Thursday in Birmingham was told he would face no further action. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London and bailed until the end of this month has also been released with no further action. As well as the six people released from custody last night, a 35-year-old man has been released with no further police action, and a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until the end of the month. Both were arrested in Manchester. Meanwhile, two men remain in custody: a 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham on Thursday morning, and a 28-year-old man arrested later in the day at a separate address in the city. They are being detained under the Terrorism Act 2000. One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. She is due to return to police until a date later this month. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Here's everything we know about him. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Read more about what we know so far here. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Read more about Masood here. The man had been in a hospital, and he was taken off life support. The man, who was not named, was one of two people who suffered life-threatening injuries in the attack. Around 23 people were injured in Wednesday's attack, and several were in critical condition. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Read more here. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Nothing to do with immigration. Read more here. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. Please continue to pray for our family. US president Donald Trump tweeted his condolences. My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. Many of the tributes included messages of condolence for PC Keith Palmer, the 48-year-old officer who died after he was stabbed outside the houses of parliament. Read more here. Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. No act of terror can shake the strength and resilience of our British ally. The very heart of the city has been struck. And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. The embassy said he had suffered a knee injury but has been discharged from hospital and that it is in contact with both their families. Read more here. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. Read more here. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Lords and MPs such as Tory MP Dominic Grieve, pictured here dodging some police tape, carried on regardless on Thursday. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. Read more here. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. Read more here. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. He has now been discharged from hospital. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Read more here. The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. Rowley also added that police understood Muslim communities might feel anxious, given previous actions by extreme right-wing groups following terrorist attacks. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Read more here. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The New York Daily News issued a correction after publishing the wrong name and photo. Investigators are treating it as terrorism, he reiterated, and the city will see an increased presence of armed and unarmed police starting immediately. They said the information was coming from colleagues in London. In fact, the image is from a 2013 incident when a man with a knife was tasered outside Buckingham Palace. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. But I know that the whole country will be thinking and praying for those who are affected, as I am. This is an ongoing incident and the Government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. Values symbolised by the Houses of Parliament. Six males and two females. Care is still ongoing. White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also released a statement in the form of a video on Twitter. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. He was pictured surrounded by medics and police officers giving CPR. Read more here. He said a police officer was among the dead, as well as a man believed to be an attacker. At least 20 people were injured. The number of those injured has not been confirmed. I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks. She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. Eyewitnesses, as well as social media accounts, appear to indicate a number of people were seriously hurt on Westminster Bridge. Earlier, a Reuters photographer, Toby Melville, published pictures of four individuals with injuries on the bridge. The Metropolitan Police Service is dealing with the incident and an urgent investigation is underway. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. I and my staff are safe and currently under lock down. This incident has not been separately confirmed by the Metropolitan police. Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. Emergency services are attempting to revive one individual lying down on the pavement on Parliament Street, some way away from the entrance to the building. Approximately a dozen armed police ran into the building shortly after 3pm."}

The burning tower or tower struck by lightning is an important card of the Tarot deck a form of divination replete with Kabbalistic symbolism. Amongst other things it foretells Physical disaster, upheaval, revolutionary change. On some decks it is surmounted by a falling crown symbolising among other things the fall of kings, materialistic thought etc. On the Rider-Waite deck small flames representing the Hebrew letter Yod are depicted. Yod represents the divine spark or potential God within man which the Kabbalists hope to liberate ( Ye Shall be as Gods ). NWO, New Age, Fabian Utopia, Open Conspiracy Jewish Messianic Age.

ReplyDelete Violin Accordion 30 March 2017 at 14:59 The shape of the face and skin colour of young Adrian Elms are entirely different from the alleged attacker ReplyDelete Anonymous 31 March 2017 at 10:22 The identity of Ms Cristea is in doubt. Look at the photo of her with her alleged boyfriend where she's doing the V sign. She has a very pronounced notch in her chin. Look at the photo of her with red hair and huge red lips and the chin is smooth. Look at the photo where she has her back to the swimming pool looking out on a night time city scape. That girl has a totally different build and arm thickness compared to the super-model-like girl coming out of the sea. Try to find online coverage of the two Romanians in Romanian websites and you will be out of luck. The dearth of stories is a giveaway. There are so many Andreea Cristeas and they all look like super models and are very similar. You cannot find the two Romanians in Facebook that appear in the Sun article. This copper needs the support of the public far and wide. Aflatoun was launched in 2005 by Princess (now Queen) Maxima of the Netherlands. Since April 2016 Graham Neale is producer for the Italian state network RAI Uno housed in the Millbank tower The Millbank tower is interesting because from here the video of the see-through Hyundai car racing over Westminster Bridge was shot. The Reuben brothers (David and Simon), who own the Millbank tower, have financed a campaign of Boris Johnson (who was in the infamous Bullingdon club with Nat Rothschild and David Cameron). So there you have it, my conclusion is that 29 days before 22 March, the final details for this false flag attack were figured out by the Brookings Institute and the Henry Jackson Society. The trail of Aflatoun International leads directly to the Dutch Royal crime family.

The image is of a tower being hit by lightning and two figures are shown falling. Tarot cards can be interpreted positively or hegatively depending on the cards around them or if they are the right way up or inverted. Some say the tower is the Tower of Bavel (Babylon) which is traditionally considered to have been destroyed by God for daring to aspire to the heights of heaven. That's the positive meaning. The negative reading would suggest the person is ignoring this message and continuing to believe themself as superhuman. Some say the figures are male and female and the male falls while the female glides. In the Golden Dawn deck there is an illustration of the Qliphoth to the left of the tower and the Tree of Life on the right. In the Book of Thoth the All-Seeing Eye features at the top of the card and a fire-breathing serpent appears at the bottom. The card is ruled by Scorpio with loys of reds, oranges and flame yellows. The Tower is Atu or Trump no. 16. For synchronicity with topic of this article ( and as I've just finished reading the book and am tarot reader) see book below. WARNING - not for the easily upset, there are some really gruesome passages. Delete Anonymous 26 June 2017 at 08:08 The more common (not necessarily more correct) association of Key 16 is with Mars. Scorpio being associated with Death, Key 13. Delete Reply Anonymous 25 June 2017 at 02:59 There seems to be a lot of creepy occult imagery concealed in much of Anglo-zionist media and entertainment industry.I Used to think this was all so much tin-foil hat stuff in my less enlightened days but now i keep an open mind. The burning tower or tower struck by lightning is an important card of the Tarot deck a form of divination replete with Kabbalistic symbolism. Amongst other things it foretells Physical disaster, upheaval, revolutionary change. On some decks it is surmounted by a falling crown symbolising among other things the fall of kings, materialistic thought etc. On the Rider-Waite deck small flames representing the Hebrew letter Yod are depicted. Yod represents the divine spark or potential God within man which the Kabbalists hope to liberate ( Ye Shall be as Gods ). NWO, New Age, Fabian Utopia, Open Conspiracy Jewish Messianic Age. Whatever the moniker it smells evil and you can be sure there is Money behind it and its been a long time in the making. On the other hand perhaps its all just one big CIA PsyOp.

Delete Anonymous 26 June 2017 at 04:47 The Magician manipulates all four tarot suit symbols and adopts a Baphomet pose with one hand pointing up and the other pointing down - as above so below - signifying connecting the spiritual with the material. Or this could be understood as the process of making ideas manifest, so your explanation makes a lot of sense. This whole scam would constitute a typical magician's trick - everyone watches the fire while the real action is elsewhere. Perhaps this housing will be used to house the new commonwealth Gastarbeiter needed post Brexit. Poor souls they aren't to blame they just want a living wage. It seems to me our Government however are intent on destroying what is left of British culture outside of obesity, illiteracy, tattoos and the conspicuous consumption of crap in pursuit of some vision of Britain a la Rhodes-Milner.

While I don't always agree with everything on this site, I've spent many hours lost in the rich mix of occult exposes of celebrities and people of power. This site is funny and scary in equal measure and well worth visiting. Absolutely remarkable coincidence that a terror drill involving a body being thrown into the Thames is replicated in real life several days later (Ms Cristea). Probably just coincidence.

The men are regualrly on PressTV and attend lots of conferences in Iran This site and others have provided plenty of evidence that the Iranian leadership have very suspicious connections to western powers and Israel. Yet the guys never mention that. As far as I know from talking to Iranians, the religious goons killed all the real student revolutionaries and subverted the revolution against the Shah. They claim they are being attacked by B'nai B'rith, and seem to expose ZioNazi bad deeds, yet something doesn't feel right to me.

We also link to another of our articles with guidance on supporting pupils who have experienced traumatic events. Contents 1 Following a terrorist attack 2 After a frightening event 3 Discussing incidents and terrorism in lessons 4 Factors to consider when speaking to children 5 Supporting pupils who have experienced traumatic events Article features 6 external links Following a terrorist attack Winston's Wish, a charity for bereaved children, has published guidance on how to respond to children affected by the media coverage of major incidents such as terrorist attacks. My children are asking lots of questions about death. After a frightening event Guidance from Child Bereavement UK explains that as children try to understand a frightening event, common reactions can include: Playing or drawing about the event Getting angry or upset more easily Not being able to concentrate Becoming more clingy with parents or carers Physical complaints such as stomach aches and headaches To support pupils after a frightening event, such as accidents, violence or terrorist attacks, it suggests that adults should: Try to make things as normal as possible to help children feel safer Help children to understand what has happened with a truthful explanation of events Be available to talk with children as and when they are ready. Tips for parents The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has published tips for parents on how to talk to children about terrorism. It is acceptable to agree with children that attacks are frightening and sad, and that you can't stop them. In addition, the guidance says that it is important to address victimisation following a terrorist attack as some children may feel targeted because of their faith or background. Discussing incidents and terrorism in lessons The PSHE Association has developed guidance for primary and secondary schools on discussing unforeseen events. Primary The guidance for the primary phase offers practical tips for discussing a terrorist attack and structuring questioning. It says: To ignore, dismiss, or not answer these questions, or to pretend that nothing has happened, can be counterproductive. Further practical suggestions cover: Offering reassurance Clarifying facts Encouraging community cohesion You can download the guidance document from the webpage below, under the subheading 'Attachments'. Secondary For secondary schools, the PSHE Association has published a framework that identifies the importance of deconstructing events, identifying the difference between factual information, speculation and rumour. It also provides examples of questions that can be used to explore initial feelings. You can download the framework from the webpage below, under the subheading 'Attachments'. Counter Terrorism Policing has also worked with the PSHE Association to develop a series of teaching resources on terrorism safety advice, for use with Key Stage 3 and 4 pupils. Factors to consider when speaking to children We spoke to 3 of our associate education experts, Jeremy Bird, Nina Siddall-Ward and Jenny Moss, about what factors schools should consider when speaking to children. We outline these factors below. School context Jeremy advised that schools consider the cultural background of the school community and the potential risk of radicalisation before speaking to children. Both Jeremy and Nina emphasised the importance of communicating to parents and pupils that the school is not demonising or attacking any particular faith or culture when discussing these events. Jeremy explained that regardless of pupils' age, teachers should be willing to listen to pupils' concerns and reassure pupils about their safety. Nina suggested that when speaking to younger pupils, teachers may want to: When speaking to younger pupils, teachers may want to emphasise the importance of staying close to parents and listening to instructions Emphasise the importance of staying close to parents and listening to instructions Help children to understand who their 'safe' adults are and who they should speak to if they do not feel safe Discuss the importance of rules and making the right choices, explaining that people who commit violence are making bad choices With older pupils, Nina and Jeremy suggested that teachers may want to Stress the importance of spiritual, moral, social and cultural (SMSC) education and British values, particularly tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs and the rule of law Frame the incident within the context of these values A further article from The Key looks at how schools can promote British values in the curriculum. For example, the level of understanding of a 16 year old with SEN who functions at the level of a 7 year old may be similar to that of primary-aged children without SEN. It is therefore important to encourage them to be open-minded, as well as approaching the subject in a way which ensures they are not fearful of everybody. Informing parents Nina also advised that schools should notify parents before talking to pupils as some parents may not want the school to speak to their child about these incidents. Additionally, by informing parents beforehand they can be more prepared if pupils ask any questions at home. Supporting pupils who have experienced traumatic events Another article from The Key relays expert advice and looks at written guidance on supporting pupils who have experienced traumatic events. It also looks at supporting pupil mental health, including children experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A further article relays advice on talking to pupils about death. Sources Jeremy Bird has extensive experience of primary headship. He has also worked with local authorities and published guidance for new and aspiring headteachers and senior leaders. Nina Siddall-Ward is an education consultant. She is the former head of standards and learning effectiveness for a large local authority. She has been a headteacher in three schools. She has worked in school leadership for almost 20 years. This article was updated in response to feedback from a school leader at a special school in London.

On Friday morning it was confirmed that a fourth person, Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, had died from her injuries suffered after being hit by Mr Masood's car on the bridge. Indeed, the attack was not just against London but against the world, he said. Those killed and injured included visitors from countries as far afield as South Korea, Australia, and the United States. After his address ended, the haunting melody of a cellist, playing a traditional Catalan melody in the nave, echoed around the Abbey. Rachel is weeping for her children . . . But the second reading, the parable of the Good Samaritan, was chosen as a direct challenge to those who sought to drive a wedge between those of different faiths who lived in London, just as it originally tackled the enmity between Jews and their brethren in Samaria, the Dean explained. It was read by the Duke of Cambridge, who was joined at the service by his wife and Prince Harry. He recalled the example of the Archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster, who joined the Chief Rabbi and leading Sunni and Shia Muslim imams to proclaim a mutual respect and abhorrence for violence outside the Abbey in the days after the attack (News, 31 March). Prayers were said by faith representatives, including a Commander of the Metropolitan Police, Mak Chishty, a Muslim, and Constable Jaskaran Garcha, a Sikh.

His fourth victim has been named as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Clapham, south London - one of three people killed by Masood's car on Westminster Bridge. Police have now released seven of the 11 people arrested since Wednesday. A 32-year-old woman, who was arrested in Manchester, has been released on bail until late March. A 39-year-old woman, from east London, had already been released on bail until late March. Two are in a critical condition, and one has life-threatening injuries. The injured include Andreea Cristea, who had an operation for a blood clot on her brain after Masood's car hit her on Westminster Bridge and knocked her into the River Thames. Romania's UK ambassador told the BBC that Ms Cristea's boyfriend Andrea Burnaz, who was also injured, had been planning to propose later that day. PC Keith Palmer, 48, died on Wednesday after being stabbed by Masood. On Friday evening it was announced that Tobias Ellwood, the MP who battled to save the life of PC Palmer, and security minister Ben Wallace have been appointed to the Privy Council - the historic group that advises monarchs - in recognition of their responses to the attack. Of those killed on Westminster Bridge, Aysha Frade, a teacher in her 40s, and US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, died on Wednesday, while Mr Rhodes, a retired window cleaner, died on Thursday evening when his life support machine was turned off. Masood, 52, had driven his car onto the pavement and into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, before crashing the vehicle into railings and running into the grounds of Parliament. He was armed with a knife and stabbed PC Palmer, before being shot dead by police. The Metropolitan Police said Masood, who had a number of previous convictions but none for terrorism, had used a number of aliases. Registered as Adrian Russell Elms, in Dartford, Kent, at birth, Masood was also known as Adrian Russell Ajao in childhood. Just an unassuming guy. In the early 2000s, Masood had been convicted of causing grievous bodily harm after slashing a man across the face with a knife in a pub. Masood was believed to have been living in the West Midlands before Wednesday's attack, but had previously spent time in Luton, Crawley, in West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex. Image copyright PA Image caption Masood was shot after stabbing PC Palmer - both men were treated at the scene He worked in Saudi Arabia for a period, understood to be about 2008. The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia said Masood had been in the country from November 2005 to November 2006 and April 2008 to April 2009, during which times he worked as an English teacher. In 2015, he obtained an Umra visa - allowing pilgrimage to Mecca - and was in the country from the 3 to 8 March.

Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. This was a long time ago. Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. I didn't know his name before. It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

Professor Anthony Glees, from the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies programme at the University of Buckingham, has called for staff from car hire companies to tell the police of any concerns they have about people renting vehicles. Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson used on Westminster Bridge from Enterprise car rentals in Spring Hill, Birmingham. Security policy is a dial, not a switch. When times are tough, you turn the dial up and I would say times are tough at moment. I think people hiring cars should be asked to give a purpose, so that people can give a judgment. The vehicles used in some of the most recent high-profile terror attacks are linked in that none of them have been owned by the attackers who used them. In the Nice attack, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel used a lorry he had rented from a local company, while in the Berlin attack last December, 12 people died when Anis Amri ploughed a hijacked lorry into a Christmas market. This link has given rise to theories that the use of vehicles not owned by the perpetrators is a deliberate tactic. The Nice lorry was rented, the Berlin lorry was hijacked. So hiring a car, hijacking a car, would seem to be part of a plan. In that context at the moment, it would make very good security sense to put car hire companies on the alert and to enable data to be shared. A spokesman for the organisation declined to comment on what level of cooperation there was between companies and the police. An industry database called Risc contains the details of drivers who have used fake IDs or damaged vehicles. This, however, would not necessarily work to prevent the hiring of a vehicle for criminal use. In the United States, the FBI and the Department of Justice have distributed flyers to local businesses highlighting potential suspicious activities. People working in vehicle rental businesses have been told to be aware of those who have a reluctance to provide personal information, who use cash for a large transaction or who question the exact dimensions or fuel capacity of a car.

A lorry has driven into a store in a busy area of central Stockholm, killing at least two people and injuring more. There is a grim history of the use of vehicles as deadly weapons by terrorists. It is often a tool of Palestinian militants because vehicles can quickly cause mass injuries and are difficult for security services to stop. Isis has instructed its supporters across the world to carry out terror attacks with vehicles. Here are some of the most high-profile terror attacks with vehicles in recent years. London, UK - 22 March 2017 A terrorist attack took place in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster in London. The attack was carried out by Briton Khalid Masood, who drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, injuring dozens, four of them fatally. It was later confirmed that a fifth victim, named as 31-year-old Andreea Cristea, had died. She had fallen off the bridge into the River Thames during the attack. Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker, had pledged allegiance to Isis before carrying out the attack. He went on the run for several days before being discovered in Milan, Italy, where he was shot dead during a confrontation with police. The driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a Tunisian resident of France, zig-zagged his way through the crowds, resulting in the deaths of 86 people, including children. He injured more than 400. The attack ended after an exchange of gunfire, during which Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was shot and killed by police. Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The assailant was shot dead by a civilian, a member of Israel's security forces and a private security guard, according to a police spokesperson. Police said he was a mentally ill alcoholic. Sarron hanged himself in prison in April 2016. Seven other people were injured and Shaloudi was shot and killed by police. The child killed in the attack was later named as Chaya Zissel Braun, a US citizen. Shaloudi's family told journalists the incident was an accident, but Israeli officials stated Shaloudi was a nephew of Mohiyedine Sharif, a known bombmaker for Hamas. The 25-year-old had reportedly been watching the two victims for several hours before the attack. He was eventually shot and killed by police. A report by the Toronto Sun reported Couture-Rouleau had called 911 before the attack to state his acts were carried out in the name of Allah. The attackers ran Rigby over with a car before killing him with knives. The Islamic extremists were sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2014. Eleven people were injured in the attack. The Dutchman steered the car at high speed through police barriers, missing the royal family, before crashing the vehicle into a monument. Tates later died of head injuries sustained in the attack. The motive is still unclear. All Rights Reserved."}

Over the past year Londoners of every faith and race have come together to show enduring resilience and unity, rather than let a pathetic individual divide us.

I recall when queuing to enter Westminster Hall for the lying-in-state of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, I was confronted by an armed policeman simply for being in a queue of mourners. David Alston EDITOR'S REPLY Dear Mustafa & David Thank you for your letters. The rise of far-Right extremism is one, while police believe the Westminster murders inspired the later London Bridge attack and that the Islamist threat has grown too. Indeed, they warned recently of the danger of the rival ideologies feeding off each other to justify violence. Fortunately, most people remain immune to such poison but vigilance is needed. The question of whether PC Palmer should have been armed is understandable. But Met Commissioner Cressida Dick says she is unsure whether he would have been able to fire because so many members of the public were nearby. Having put up with several years of inconvenience and congestion as cycle superhighways were installed at great expense, I am disappointed to see how few cyclists actually use them. Most of the hi-vis crowd use the main roads, causing friction (sometimes literally) with buses, taxis and lorries, which now have only one lane in each direction to use. Worse still, many of these cycling commuters seem to be a law unto themselves. I realise that stopping at a red light is a pain as it adds time to your journey, but cyclists must adhere to the same laws as everyone else. I have also observed that some only have one light or none at all. As a cyclist and motorcyclist, I consider myself to be subject to the same rules, obligations and constraints. Sadly, many do not. However, there are still many unanswered questions for businesses. We have staff located in Europe and many of our UK-based workforce are from the EU. We need a diverse range of language skills as well as an understanding of the nuances of how different cultures travel. But we are still no clearer on what Brexit will mean in terms of trading conditions or for our staff. Until the Government fully clarifies what Brexit will look like both during and after the transitional period, we remain in limbo. At a stroke this would solve the Irish border issue, prevent the likely 30-mile tailbacks on the Dover road, and minimise the economic damage to both the UK and Ireland. I would have thought Brexiteers would welcome this. It is positive to see the Government finally recognising that longer periods of time off are a crucial part of effective policies for working parents. While we wait for these new policies to come into effect businesses should be working to provide all new parents with flexible working hours. Not only does this allow dads and mums to adjust to returning to work while balancing family life, it also makes strong business sense. Yes, submit this vote Cancel You must be logged in to vote.

The 29-year-old British suspect is not believed to be known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police. A vehicle swerved into cyclists and pedestrians shortly after 07:30 BST before crashing into a barrier outside the Houses of Parliament. Two people were treated in hospital for their injuries but later discharged. A third person with minor injuries was assessed at the scene. A woman who witnessed police arriving to search the Nottingham property told the BBC the raid took place between about 15:00 and 16:00 BST.

A number of eyewitnesses have said the silver Ford Fiesta, which was travelling westbound in Parliament Square, appeared to deliberately hit members of the public as it swerved into the opposite lane. 'Formidable courage' Footage released by the BBC shows the moment when the car then crosses over a traffic island in the middle of the road before crashing into the security barriers. A police officer can be seen jumping over another barrier to get out of the way. The immediate area around the incident remains taped off and screened by white temporary fencing. Parliament is not currently sitting. The Houses of Parliament are surrounded with security barriers of steel and concrete. The measures were extended in the wake of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017 when Khalid Masood ploughed a car into crowds on Westminster Bridge, killing four people. Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Security arrangements at Parliament have progressively tightened since 2001. These include the reinforced low black rampart-like walls that surround Parliament itself and a highly visible armed police presence. Visitors need to go through a chicane-like system designed to help armed officers spot suspects. The one significant weak spot was the main vehicle gates - as became apparent in March 2017's one-man attack. That triggered an internal security review that has led to changes that remain secret - although it's apparent to Londoners that there are now more armed police than ever before patrolling the area. The threat of terrorism is a constant concern for Parliamentarians - it's not new. Irish republican paramilitaries murdered Airey Neave MP in 1979 in a car bomb that exploded within the palace grounds. And the dilemma remains the same: how best to balance security with guaranteeing that the heart of British democracy remains open to the people. The prime minister's official spokesman said as of the end June 2018 there were 676 live investigations into potential terrorist plots. He said since March 2017, 13 Islamist plots and four far-right plots had been foiled. Scotland Yard is asking anyone with information on Tuesday's crash to call 0800 789 321.

The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. This was a long time ago. Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. I didn't know his name before. It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

Meanwhile, the arrivals on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning of goalkeepers Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi have helped bring down the blood pressure of technical officials of the Super Eagles ahead of the two international friendly matches against Senegal and Burkina Faso. An interesting match is at hand as Nigeria seek a 10th win over Senegal in 21 clashes at senior level. Venue is The Hive, home ground of League 2 teams Barnet FC and London Bees. Organisers told thenff.com that they expect about 3,000 spectators at the 6,000-capacity ground. Both nations first clashed at senior level on February 27, 1963, Nigeria winning an Nkrumah Cup game 4-0, but the Senegalese replied in equal measure six weeks later, hammering the Eagles 5-1 in a Friendship Games match in Dakar. Nigeria defeated host Senegal 2-1 in the opening match of the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations, and won by the same margin when eliminating the Teranga Lions in the quarter -finals of the 2000 edition that she co-hosted with Ghana. The Lions paid back by beating Nigeria (same scoreline) in the semi-finals of the 2002 Cup of Nations in Mali. But Nigeria has won the past two encounters between both nations, both at the 2006 Cup of Nations in Egypt: a group phase match in Port Said that ended 2-1 and the bronze medal match that ended 1-0 in Cairo.

There are fears Khalid Masood may have been encouraged by others to carry out the attack, as three more people were today arrested and police probe the theory he had been radicalised before striking in London. PA:Press Association 3 Westminster attacker Khalid Masood was also known as Adrian Elms and Adrian Russell Ajao PA 3 Khalid Masood lies on a stretcher outside Parliament with paramedics treating his injuries while armed cops stand guard Counter-terrorist detectives are attempting to trace any associates of the killer as they weed out what triggered the terrorist's rampage. This comes as the number of arrests following the horrific attack on the capital rose to 11 today. Since the night of the attack on Westminster police have raided homes across the UK and arrested people on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 27-year-old man was held in Birmingham last night and a man aged 35 was arrested during a swoop in Manchester. A woman aged 32 was also held in Manchester this morning. They were all arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and quizzed by police trying to piece together how he came to carry out the attack. A clearer picture of Masood's movements before he wrought carnage on Westminster is beginning to emerge. He stayed in the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton, reportedly telling staff as he checked out that he was going to London. Meanwhile, the widow of a man attacked with a knife by Masood in a pub assault said her late husband was injured after defending someone during a row. Masood was jailed for two years over the 2000 attack in the car park of a pub in Northiam, near Rye in East Sussex, according to a news report at the time. The English teacher had a string of aliases and was born in South East London under the name Adrian Elms. He grew up in Tunbridge Wells, Sussex, where he was known as Adrian Elms before taking on his stepfather's surname of Ajao.

Their coach Tony Davis was with them and attempted to save Palmer's life after he had suffered what proved to be fatal injuries. Despite the way the troubling scenes affected them, the British Lionhearts fighters chose to persist with Thursday evening's World Series of Boxing fixture against Italia Thunder and impressively secured a 5-0 victory overall. The Italians were also present at Westminster alongside fighters Frazer Clarke, Pat McCormack, Muhammad Ali, Calum French and Bulgarian Radoslav Pantaleev at the event celebrating one year of the British Lionhearts in the Community. The Lionhearts were on their way to an exit on New Palace Yard when the attack on Palmer took place, before his attacker Khalid Masood was shot by police. Flyweight and 2016 Olympian Ali was the first to fight, doing so just 30 hours after Wednesday's events, and secured the first of four unanimous-decision points victories despite a second-round knockdown. We were right in front of it. It was weird timing that we saw it all, but it's not something anyone wants to see. My head was a bit all over and I couldn't really stop thinking about it but I'm just glad I've come, got the job done and the win. The coaches handled it very well, got us through it. He saw a lot more than us and was a bit shook up. We tried to really concentrate, and focus on the boxing instead, but my heart goes out to those involved. I'm really sorry for the people involved. Police officers lost colleagues, families, friends. We were the lucky ones so we had every reason to get in there and put a show on. I don't need closure. The families need closure; the colleagues. The mother that has to look after the children. They're the ones that it's impacting, not me. But someone was looking down on us; we didn't go out there (in time to be caught up in the attack). The fourth of the Lionhearts' five wins was secured by Pantaleev, over Gianluca Rosciglione. It emerged earlier on Thursday that PC Palmer had long been a Charlton season-ticket holder, and that the League One club have planned a tribute to him."}

The Houses of Parliament were regarded as a trophy target for terrorists. An ugly ribbon of steel and concrete sprang up, aimed at preventing a suicide bomber with a truck bringing carnage to the heart of London. The loser who set out intent on mass murder at Westminster used instead a weapon as commonplace as it is deadly: a car, driven at speed into crowds of tourists and Londoners. They were the softest of targets. As a city, as a nation and as a world, we must accept that those who seek to trample on our liberal, open and tolerant way of life will turn increasingly to such rudimentary tactics. And we need to move swiftly to protect the crowds who sightsee, stroll and pose for selfies in the tourist heartland of London. Yet in one sense we must turn the clock back to around 1802, a time without motorised transport. Buses, taxis and bikes, of course, must flow across the Thames. But we need to learn from Brussels, which suffered so badly exactly a year earlier. The main thoroughfare that previously carved from north to south has been closed to normal traffic, and life at the core of the Belgian capital is returning to walking (or cycling) pace.

In the chaos of the immediate aftermath, several major MSM outlets were criticized for their coverage of the events, which included graphic, unobscured images and videos of the victims of the attack. While social media platforms do have content filters in place, the sheer volume of graphic content shared in the wake of the attacks caused the questionable content to be shared far and wide on both legacy and digital media, with little to no filtering. Stop tweeting those pictures. Channel 4 News issued a retraction and apologized, but the incident further highlighted the precarious nature of journalism in the digital age.

It is understood PC Palmer's family were home but too upset to speak to anyone outside the family. Neighbours of the 48-year-old, who was stabbed by a terrorist outside Parliament yesterday, expressed their shock at the news. It came after acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley confirmed Pc Palmer, a father-of-two who was a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Squad, had sadly died, despite the efforts of paramedics and Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood to save him. Keith, aged 48, had 15 years' service and was a husband and father. The bravery of the officer was later hailed by colleagues, friends and the many MPs whom he was charged with protecting. We served together in the Royal Artillery before he became a copper. I'm heartbroken. My thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Pc Keith Palmer. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, joined those sending prayers and thoughts to the family of Pc Palmer. A chorus of thanks also came from politicians on all sides of the House.

Four other innocents also died in the attack after being hit by the knifeman's death motor. The attacker was shot by police and later died in hospital. Paramedics fought to save Mr Palmer's life, and that of his attacker, on the floor of the cobbled courtyard in front of Parliament.

So far, 2018 looks on track to be lower still. That was a drop from 2016, which was in turn a drop from 2015. Right now, the number of terrorist attacks and deaths from terrorism appears to have peaked in 2014, when there were nearly 17,000 attacks and more than 45,000 victims. On a global scale, however, the answer is clear. Though there was a surge in terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, most attacks still occur in the Middle East and Africa, and those regions saw a big decline in 2017. The number of terrorist attacks in the Middle East and North Africa dropped by 38 percent year on year according to START; the number of victims declined by 44 percent. That can largely be attributed to the Islamic States' loss of territory and military defeats throughout 2017. Without a stable base, the number of attacks the jihadist group could stage in countries like Iraq and Syria dropped sharply, as did the damage it could inflict on civilian populations. Indeed, it was largely thanks to the rise of the Islamic State and other extremist groups like Boko Haram that 2014 became such a remarkable year for global terrorism in the first place. But a closer read of the 2014 statistics paints a nuanced picture. Even though the total number of deaths globally from terrorism that year was clearly terrible (more than 45,000, according to START), it was still less than the number of deaths due to drug overdoses that same year in the United States alone. But terrorism has still shaken American politics. A Pew poll from July 2016, for example, found that voters thought that terrorism should get more time than any other subject in presidential debates. Trump voters, Pew found, felt most strongly about this. Notably, on Tuesday, two separate reports suggested the number of fighters still with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is considerably higher than previously estimated. But a bigger question is whether we can even know that terrorism is declining. For the past six years, the State Department provided funding to START, effectively subcontracting the job of data collection on terrorism. Though the team is now seeking alternative funding, Miller said, there are currently no plans to publish data for 2018. In its place, we may be left with more unscientific, emotional measures of global terrorism. The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

Higher Education today is shaped by frantic competition for students and huge building projects. The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 even allows universities to go bankrupt. Much of this argument will be familiar to colleagues. The debate about the University Superannuation Scheme (USS) deficit has been an active subject of discussion on campuses since last summer when the press first announced that the pension scheme was at risk. This is a key question, of course. Most important of all, until we know the source of the deficit we cannot begin to propose solutions. In the letter we attributed the reported deficit to three causes. Pension Acts and associated government regulation of private sector pension schemes Quantitative Easing and government monetary policy The impact of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 on the financial behaviour of universities We will turn to these shortly. First we need to summarise briefly the methodology that is used for valuing USS. Future liabilities are estimated on the basis of a number of actuarial assumptions, including life expectancy for men and women, projections of wage and consumer price inflation, and so on. Several of these assumptions have been criticised for over-estimating the liabilities. Small changes in assumptions can have very large consequences thanks to the effect of compound interest. In the most recent valuation, it has been the method for valuing the assets of the scheme that has been the focus of most public challenges. One might think that the scheme should be valued in terms of the assets it holds. Suppose you own a house and you want to use your house value to ease your retirement. Your principal concern will be about the market value of that house in the future (and future remortgaging conditions). They found that income and liabilities closely match for the next 40 years without touching the assets. Figure 1: Doing nothing is a genuine option: income (green) closely matches outgoings (blue) for the next 40 years with some modest assumptions. From Salt and Benstead (2017) Progressing the Valuation of USS. London: First Actuarial. That is, if no action were taken, USS would be able to pay its pensioners well into the future without even touching its assets. Its assets could therefore continue to be invested in a mixed portfolio, and (although past performance is no guarantee) grow at a rate exceeding inflation. Like the house buyer, they are not about to sell their house at current market prices. However, this is not how USS values its assets. But essentially the idea is as follows. Assume that USS closes tomorrow. In order to guarantee payments to pensioners it needs to shield assets from stock market variability. It means selling stock at current prices and buying gilts, and predicting future gilt yields. Crucially, they are likely to stay well below inflation for the near and long term. Note that this is a counterfactual assumption. It is not a model of the running of the scheme. It is a model of what would need to happen if the employers ceased to operate. If all universities went bankrupt tomorrow, staff would not be paid, and USS would receive no employer and employee contributions. The scheme would close, and would then have to pay out its liabilities. The obvious question has to be whether sectoral bankruptcy is a meaningful basis for valuing this pension scheme. Private sector pension scheme regulations say that valuations must take place by modelling this scenario. In the case of single-employer schemes, the worst-case assumption is important. Employers like BHS and Carillion were the sole employer paying into their pension schemes. The single employer can declare bankruptcy, leaving the pension scheme to pay out entirely on its assets. But the 68 large pre-92 Higher Education institutions who are the principal members of USS are not a single employer. The model assumes all institutions go bankrupt simultaneously. This is an extraordinary assumption, one that in political terms can be said to have zero probability. That is, if the entire pre-92 university sector declared bankruptcy, I would contend that the government of the day would be faced with a political crisis of unprecedented scale, compelling them to intervene to protect staff, students and pensions. There has been no instance of a single bankruptcy of a pre-92 university since USS was established. Instead, universities have been obliged to merge, teach out courses and thereby transfer staff and students. Thus when University College Cardiff was in financial difficulty in 1987, it merged with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST, also in some difficulty) and the University of Wales College of Cardiff, to become Cardiff University. This means that even in cases of financial hardship for one institution the sector itself may continue to grow. The joint and several liability for the pension scheme means other employers pick up the tab, just as they grow market share. Let us consider the shocking scenario where a large Russell Group university declares bankruptcy. This is a more realistic possibility than sectoral closure. It is a scenario newly envisaged by the Higher Education and Research Act. Worse, let us also assume that the Government takes a zero-intervention approach, and does not fund a gradual withdrawal from the undergraduate market. The exit of a large player from a market of many competing institutions may be a severe shock, causing (say) 10,000 USS active members to be without employment, and their contributions to cease. In 2017, USS had a total of 190,546 active members (those paying into their scheme). Note: the figure of 10,000 reflects one of the big institutions like UCL. There are 68 pre-92 university employers out of the 350 participating employers. Considering only these employers would obtain an average of 2,802 active USS members per institution. But markets with many players can absorb market share relatively easily. Students will need to move somewhere, and staff will be required to teach them. Grant-funded research activity is hypothecated (funding is earmarked solely for that purpose) and much of it will relocate, with staff. So the redundancies will be absorbed by employment elsewhere. In other words, the obligation to share risk across the sector is, in fact, offset by the ability of institutions to absorb market share. Rather, it is to point out that for USS, these consequences should not be exaggerated. Yet exaggerating the risk of bankruptcy lies at the heart of this valuation model. The result of the USS valuation in September 2017 was the following distribution. The sketch below illustrates the principle. The distribution is approximately Normal, and symmetric. Indeed, the zero point is 0.27 standard deviations below the mean, a probability of 0.21 of the area on the left hand side of the mean. Of course, this entire model hinges on the need to de-risk. Having consulted their members, they concluded that the sector would not like to carry the theoretical declining risk of a mixed portfolio for the next ten years, and would wish to model immediate de-risking. This obtained the following graph. Again, the scheme is in surplus. The projection has become slightly more certain. The actuarial term is extremely misleading. Now that we have understood the valuation method currently in operation, we can consider the three causes outlined in our letter. Cause 1: The Pensions Acts and the Pension Regulator There have been a flurry of Pensions Acts since 2004. There were Pensions Acts in 2004, 2007, 2008 (which established automatic enrolment), 2011, 2014 and 2017. The key ones for our argument concern the office of the Pension Regulator. The Pension Regulator was established by the Pensions Act 2004. On paper, a Pensions Regulator is a good thing, attempting to ensure through intervention that private pension schemes are self-standing in the circumstances where an employer goes bankrupt. However, the regulatory requirements of the Pension Regulator primarily concern Defined Benefit schemes. As bankrupts cannot pay bills, this duty means intervening in the valuation and regulation of live schemes. The Pension Regulator insists on cautionary estimates of pension scheme deficits. The 2014 Act introduced a new statutory duty on the Pension Regulator. This is to minimise any adverse impact on the sustainable growth of sponsoring employers when exercising its functions relating to scheme funding. The Pension Regulator has a number of statutory obligations, the central one being of course to ensure that pension schemes do not fall into deficit. But the new statutory duty of 2014 places the commercial interests of sponsoring employers over the responsibility to fund private sector pension schemes. The obvious point is that modelling a multi-employer pension scheme (especially one whose income stream is an hypothecated section of public sector finances) as if it were a single employer is absurd. Modelling any risk of default on a zero-probability event is to model a zero probability. Indeed the way to risk deficit is to do precisely this. Therefore the Pension Regulator simply needs to accept that the valuation method being used is meaningless, and recognise that efforts to address a non-existent deficit risk are counter-productive. The current manifestation of QE is the retention by the Bank of England of artificially low interest rates. This has had the effect of pushing up the cost of buying gilts but depressing their rate of return (yield). But this has been overtaken by inflation. The crucial factor for a pension fund is whether gilt yields exceed CPI. If all the assets are in gilts, any below-inflation growth is a real-terms decline in asset values. Inflation erodes the pension assets. This is precisely why early de-risking (despite its name) increases the chance of scheme default. Cause 3: The Higher Education and Research Act and its precursors Government HE policy since 2010 culminated in the Higher Education and Research Act 2017. But they were still restricted in the numbers of students they could recruit. This all changed with the removal in 2014 of caps on student numbers. Universities could now compete with each other for students, and market share. The first set of victims have been the post-92 universities, the ex-polytechnics, whose staff are not in the USS pension scheme. In this first wave, the USS employers have boomed. However, to accommodate the new student numbers, universities needed estate capacity. They started a major programme of investment in new buildings, campuses and student accommodation. To do this they needed to borrow. Whereas some initial loans may have been on favourable terms, as construction costs have increased, institutions have had to borrow on the open market. Of course, when you borrow in this way you have to declare your assets and your liabilities, including the liability toward the pension fund. It is this new obligation that I believe explains why, in the USS negotiations, UUK employers (led by the most expansionist Russell Group employers) focused on Defined Contribution, rather than, say, a worse Defined Benefit scheme. This is because a shift to Defined Contribution removes any future liability the employers have towards the stability of the scheme. It ends the employer covenant. Conclusion The fight over the USS pension is the first national dispute over the finances and shape of the UK Higher Education sector since the enactment of the Higher Education and Research Bill as an Act. Market competition and the new regulatory environment are causing employers to try to limit their liabilities and reduce their costs. One can read the specific solutions proposed by the employers as signifiers of their priorities towards staff more generally. When we wrote the Alternative White Paper for Higher Education, we did not predict that the first victim of the new HE regime would be university pensions. For decades USS was strong and stable. There is no evidence that any intrinsic factor has changed. USS has a set of internal regulations and parameters for managing stock market risk. The deficit is a projection under imagined conditions. It is counterfactual, and not real. To compound this observation, even in these impossible conditions the scheme is odds-on to achieve a surplus. The deficit that arises is an artefact of the scale of uncertainty assumed in the model. All three of these extrinsic factors arise as a result of Government policy, whether they be Pension Acts, QE or the fees-and-loans market in education. A compromise solution that leaves the valuation methodology in place invites future cuts in the scheme. We need to fix the problem at source. Moreover, providing this assurance to scheme Trustees until the next valuation would also permit the National Audit Office to review the valuation methodology and propose rational alternatives. USS is required to value the scheme every 3 years and to do so in a way that considers long and short term, but it is not required to use the current approach. There is already an Early Day Motion 619 signed (at the time of writing) by 65 MPs. The problem and the solution lies in Westminster. It is time to resolve this dispute by preserving the scheme as-is. In the meantime, staff in universities are absolutely correct to strike. Unless they do, Government minds will not be concentrated. The main problem we faced in campaigning over the HE Bill was not that we did not convince senior Government figures of our analysis. It was that there was not a mass movement outside of Parliament to defend our Universities. That has all changed with USS. The Alternative White Paper for Higher Education.

Very clear and very helpful. Will share. LikeLiked by 1 person Reply Austin Tate says: March 6, 2018 at 9:39 pm A reasonable valuation of the assets taking into account the plural nature of employing institutions is of course a big issue, but the calculation of the liabilities needs also to be taken into account. Final salary scheme pensions are calculated based on the best year in a period of some 12 years prior to retirement updated by inflation (CPI now rather than the previous RPI). University staff salaries have been held down to well below both measures of inflation for a decade or more. This means in the coming years the salary base used in pensions calculations of many staff with significant years of service will actually begin to fall reducing, not increasng, USS liabilities for those staff. As many in universities and some vice chancellors (e.g. Imperial and Edinburgh) have now been suggesting it is essential that a fair and transparent valuation of assets on a proper considered basis (not some simplified worst case scenario) and the liabilities (using the real data on salaries) is done by some group able to do a proper evidence and data based analysis, not using some unbelievable formulaic approach. This needs to be thorough, detailed and transparent so it is accepted by all sides before any change is made to the current USS scheme so soon after the recent significant changes. The evidence base will also be needed if challenges to regulator formulae or government rules are necessary.

The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. This was a long time ago. Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed.

The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

Mayor Sadiq Khan called for Londoners to attend a candlelit vigil at Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening in solidarity with the victims and their families and to show that London remains united. A lawmaker who battled to save the life of a police officer stabbed in the Parliament attack has been honored with an appointment as an adviser to Queen Elizabeth II. British Prime Minister Theresa May's office says Tobias Ellwood has been named to the Privy Council, a committee of senior lawmakers, judges and others that advises the queen. Security Minister Ben Wallace, who helped coordinate the government response to Wednesday's attack, has also been named to the Privy Council. Ellwood, a former army officer whose brother died in the 2002 Bali bombing, gave mouth-to-mouth-resuscitation to Constable Keith Palmer after he was stabbed by attacker Khalid Masood as he was guarding the Parliament. Palmer died of his injuries. The two women and four men were all arrested in the central England city of Birmingham, where attacker Khalid Masood recently lived. All had been arrested on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. Four other people remain in custody as police try to learn how Masood became radicalized and went on a rampage Wednesday in London with an SUV and knives that killed four people. He was later shot to death by police. Police believe Masood acted alone but want to know whether others helped him prepare the attack.

He shook hands with nurses, who took photos of him as he left the ward. The hospital has treated eight victims. Romanian officials have not identified the woman, who fell into the Thames River when a SUV plowed into pedestrians on Wednesday, citing privacy regulations. Friends have identified her as Andreea Cristea, an interior designer, from the Black Sea port of Constanta. The embassy said Friday any further health updates would need to be approved by her family. Ambassador to Britain Dan Mihalache said on Thursday she underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from her brain. The embassy said her boyfriend has been discharged from the hospital. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has joined other Londoners in leaving floral tributes to honor the police officer killed in the London terror attack. Khan's note and flowers were placed outside of New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Force. HERO. Palmer was stabbed to death by an attacker on Wednesday as he guarded the British Parliament in the heart of London. A former British Army officer told the BBC on Friday that rescuers held the hand of Constable Keith Palmer and talked to him as they tried in vain to save his life after he was stabbed during the attack on Parliament. Mike Crofts, a former Army captain who served in Afghanistan, said he was in the courtyard outside the Houses of Parliament following a meeting with politicians about using boxing to engage young men when the attack took place. We held his hand through the experience. The manager of a hotel where the London attacker stayed the night before he plowed his 4x4 into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then stabbed a police officer at Parliament says he seemed unusually outgoing and mentioned details about his family, including having a sick father. Police raided the room at the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton after the attack, searching for clues about Khalid Masood, who was identified Friday by his prior name, Adrian Russell Ajao. Toumi said Masood checked in under his own name and mentioned having a couple of children, as well as troubles with an ailing father. Among the items seized were the trouser press and the toilet paper holder. He was the perfect British bobby, patiently and politely posing for a photo with a family of tourists from Australia, a wry smile on his face. Keith Palmer, the policeman stabbed to death in the Westminster attack on Wednesday, left a lasting warm impression on the Thorogoods on that day last October, as he willingly posed with the family for a picture. Parliament, the building that Palmer was guarding when he was murdered, was in the background. London's top terror officer says Khalid Masood, who attacked Britain's Parliament, killing four people and wounding some 50, was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Counter-terror chief Mark Rowley revealed the name in a briefing Friday outside Scotland Yard in which he also said there were two other significant arrests. That brought the total number of people in custody for the Wednesday attack to nine. The attacker was born in southeastern England and had most recently been living in the central city of Birmingham. Nine people are currently in custody, while one has been released on bail. Counter-terror chief Mark Rowley on Friday also identified the latest victim, who died in the hospital on Thursday, as 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from Streatham, south London. The attacker, identified as Khalid Masood, drove his car into crowds of people on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon, killing three and wounding some 50, before stabbing a police officer to death at the Houses of Parliament. He was shot dead by police."}

Video: Parliament TV A police officer places flowers and a photograph of PC Keith Palmer on Whitehall near the Houses of Parliament in London. Police activity on Whitehall in London the day after a terrorist attack where police officer Keith Palmer and three members of the public died and the attacker was shot dead. A police officer walks across Westminster Bridge the morning after an attack by a man driving a car and wielding a knife that left five people, including himself, dead and dozens injured, in London. On Thursday night, Scotland Yard said a 75-year-old man who was injured in the attack has died in hospital bringing the death toll to five including the attacker. Masood, who was shot dead during the attack, was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was also known by a number of aliases, police said in a statement. Scotland Yard said Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack. However, he was known to police and had a range of previous convictions for assaults including grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He has not been convicted for any terrorism offences. One Irish person was among the 40 people injured which also included 12 Britons, three French, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Chinese, one Italian and two Greeks. Police said seven of the 40 injured people were in a critical condition. Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan said his department had offered and was ready to provide consular assistance to the injured person. Policeman Keith Palmer (48) and three civilians were killed in the attack. Masood also died after he was shot by police officers. Ms Frade, a mother of two, worked as a teacher at DLD College in London and had family in the northwestern Spanish town of Betanzos. It is believed she was walking from the school where she taught when she was hit by the car driven by the attacker. Ms May also paid tribute to the bravery of the police at the scene on Wednesday. Witnesses on Wednesday described seeing one of the victims injured in the attack being pulled from the river Thames. Romanian ambassador Dan Mihalache told Realitatea TV that the woman sustained serious head injuries and has badly damaged lungs. Her boyfriend suffered a foot fracture. The woman has undergone surgery for a compound leg fracture. Although police have stressed there is no specific information to suggest any further threat to the public, officers will also be on heightened alert for any copy-cat incidents or further attacks. UK police and MI5, supported by GCHQ, have been conducting an unprecedented and largely successful operation to contain the threat. Intelligence agencies estimate there are around 3,000 potentially violent Islamist extremists in the UK, most of them British. Counter-terrorism units are carrying out more than 500 investigations at any one time and say they have foiled 13 potential attacks in less than four years. Meanwhile, a man was arrested in Belgium on Thursday after he tried to drive into a crowd at high speed in a shopping area of Antwerp. The driver, a man of north African origin, was arrested after a chase in the city centre. He was carrying weapons and military uniforms in the boot of the car, according to the RTFB state broadcaster. The Palace of Westminster was locked down within minutes, with MPs in the House of Commons chamber told to lie on the floor immediately after the attack. The commons was suspended but MPs had to remain in the chamber for four hours until the lockdown was lifted. As the dead and injured lay strewn on the ground, the vehicle crashed into a railing outside parliament, close to Big Ben. Masood ran from the car and through the gates of parliament, stabbing two policemen who tried to stop him. Armed officers shouted at Masood and then fired a number of shots. PC Palmer also died, despite an attempt by foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood and others to revive him and bind his stab wounds. I made peace. Sign In Invalid email or password."}

Reuters 6 Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley revealed that four terrorist plots involving right wing fanatics have been foiled since the Westminster attacks last March It compares to 10 Islamic terrorist conspiracies which were smashed by police and MI5 during the same period. In a worrying new trend, at least two of the foiled neo-Nazi plots involved a group of suspects, rather than lone wolves like Finsbury Park killer van driver Darren Osborne and nail bomber David Copeland.

They should be taken away from their parents to stop them being exposed to terrorist propaganda, he believes. He pointed out 100 children had been dealt with through family courts since the start of the Syrian war. He feared home schooling was being used as a cover to radicalise children. Mr Rowley welcomed the specialist skills brought to the task by the Security Service, but added a response from across the whole of society was needed to tackle extremism and terrorism.

The 29-year-old British citizen, originally from Sudan, has also been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, Met Police said. He came to the UK as a refugee and was granted asylum, the BBC understands. Three people were injured when the car hit cyclists and pedestrians during Tuesday morning's rush hour. The silver Ford Fiesta then crashed into security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament just before 07:40 BST. A man and a woman were taken to hospital after the crash and later discharged, while another man was treated for minor injuries at the scene. The suspect is not believed to have been known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police, but is understood to have been known to local police. He did not co-operate with officers after his arrest, Scotland Yard said. Police have concluded searches of two properties in Birmingham and one in Nottingham, and are currently searching a third address in Birmingham. He said while detectives were holding Mr Khater on suspicion of terror offences, they had not yet formally declared the crash a terrorist incident, suggesting they had not yet found anything to link him to extremism. Khater came to Britain in 2010 and successfully applied for UK citizenship in the past two years. His brother said he had been planning a trip back home to see his family, having not seen them for some time. Khater is believed to have lived in a first-floor flat above a parade of shops in the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham until four months ago, when he moved to the city's Highgate area. Neighbours called him a quiet man who frequently visited an internet cafe and a nearby shisha lounge, both on Stratford Road. Having completed his secondary education in Sudan, he studied electrical engineering at university there before moving to the UK. He studied English as a second or foreign language at City College from 2010 to 2011, later studying a diploma in science at South and City College in Birmingham from 2014 to 2017. More recently, Khater studied accountancy at Coventry University from September 2017 to May this year, a spokesman for the university said. He is no longer enrolled there. Members of the Sudanese community have suggested Mr Khater may have had an appointment in London at the Sudan embassy to obtain a visa for his trip. Birmingham Central Mosque said its inquiries with the community found he did not worship at the mosque and had showed no signs of radicalisation. It says he worked in Libya for two years as a farm labourer before coming to the UK. The BBC understands Khater did spend time in Libya before travelling to Britain, but has not confirmed the exact timeframe. The CV also suggests he spent time as a security guard in Nottingham.

I would not be here if it was not for the PFOA - they literally saved my life. In February 2017 I was long-term sick off of work and I was in a very bad place. Whilst I have been unable to continue as a serving officer, I will forever be indebted to the PFOA. I will never be able to repay them for all that they did. All I can say is thank you so much from me and my family. A respite break was granted to allow the officer and his family to get away and spend some valuable time together as a family unit. The PFOA purchased a new cross trainer and have loaned this to the officer to enable him to remain active and hopefully return to Ops. PFOA arranges support for the officers involved prior to the Inquest and after by way of a respite breaks and NLP Coaching or Counselling. I would like to personally thank the PFOA for the gifts we received for our daughter. The timing could not have been better. the week the gifts arrived, she had lost her hair and was due to go back to hospital for her next round of chemotherapy treatment which she was not looking forward to. Opening the parcel put a big smile back on her face for two reasons. firstly, because you had chosen as gifts exactly what she would have chosen for herself. But secondly and more importantly, because she realised other people ere also thinking of her and willing her to get better. People she had never met. Thank you so much for the shopping vouchers, they will come in very handy. Thank you for helping my daddy to be himself again. This act of kindness was greatly appreciated by us both at what is a very difficult time for our family."}

To appreciate the array of odd behaviour on display in the BBC footage of the so-called terror attack outside Parliament on the 14th August, one needs to understand the lay of the roads thereabouts. The A3212 runs parallel to the Thames with Parliament on its left, and the Square on its right. At the corner of Parliament Square, there is a choice to bend around to the right to travel perpendicularly with the river along the southern edge of the garden area, or to tend to the left and continue, eventually, to Millbank. This south-to-north section of the A3212 merges into the western-travelling traffic after the right-hand bend (abovementioned), so essentially there are three pieces of road at the south-east corner of Parliament Square that are separated from each other by central reservations. Moments later, an ambulance on a call (its lights flashing) that has weaved from the very left-hand side of the road into the very right-hand side, speeds past Khater, who turns, as if triggered to do it, sharply onto the reservation that separates the bend and the south-to-north section of the A3212. Luckily (by design, some might say) traffic lights have stopped oncoming vehicles so that Khater can drive the wrong way along a one-way road without coming to any harm, and over the reservation onto the A3212 going south. So much for the main plot. In the background behind the Fiat is a silver van with its lights on (Fig. 1). This is demonstrated by the way it continuously showed its right-hand headlight along the side of the white van, which was travelling sedately, as if it was always looking for a way to pass even by mounting the kerb. The Establishment has dealt with this officially and unofficially. Basu of the Met Police denied the police tail, as we have seen, but also made it be known that Mi5 had never heard of Khater. The distancing from the suspect is therefore complete in a way that rarely happens in such a case. The silver van carries on following the Fiesta wherever it goes. He would only know if he was an insider on the operation. His contribution is merely to encourage people not to think too much. The reader must understand that study of such events has taught the author a fact: there is not an arrangement that is ever too complex to rule it out from being employed by Government to perpetrate its state crime. And in this event, it is quite possible that the traffic lights on the junction complex coming from the south into Parliament Square were set to red at an appointed time, and then stayed red for an interminable time (and undeterminable time as far as we are concerned) for the purposes of the operation. Fig.12 of the image array shows a line of traffic coming from the south that has, at its head, the same vehicles that were waiting there when the incident started. The reader might be astonished to learn that an ambulance arrived on the scene coming the wrong way up this road 39 seconds after the Fiesta crashed into that barrier (Fig. 10). This man runs across all the roads to stand by yards away from the Fiesta, where he appears to signal with a raised hand. This is extraordinary, as there are also police present at the scene, amongst them, the ones famously leaping out of the way of the crashing vehicle (the same ones who may yet be decorated for bravery, by all accounts). And yet, this character is permitted to stand by the vehicle belonging to the suspect in a crime unmolested. Eventually it is turned so that it can drive across the central reservation, and down into the crash scene. Again, the occupants of this vehicle have too much interest in the Fiesta, and act with too much authority for them to be well meaning passers-by. While this case is already possibly the dopiest false flag attack that ever took place in the history of the world, the floundering British Authorities are not through being incompetent yet. The police appear to be briefing the corporate-media, who is telling its audience that Khater is not playing ball. The Wikipedia entry for the incident says: An ambulance immediately behind the Ford stopped and gave assistance to the injured. Basu is talking about the ambulance that sped past the Fiesta. There was no ambulance immediately behind the Fiesta to give assistance. The author is of the opinion that an effort to misrepresent the nature of the one vehicle behind the Fiesta that did actually stop is evidence that it was a police vehicle after all. A mystery white van seen pursuing the alleged terrorist who drove into cyclists outside the Houses of Parliament was a member of the public trying to stop the attack, it emerged today. At first there was speculation that the mystery van was a police surveillance team who were secretly following Khater. However security sources confirmed that the driver was a member of the public who wanted to help. However, the magic does work on the Muggles, and there are many, many more of them.

According to the Mail on Sunday, a well-placed source said that Masood, 52, made the farewell call to a family member in the South East. Westminster terrorist Khalid Masood Credit: METROPOLITAN POLICE In most interpretations of Islam, Masood's final words appear to follow the belief that Muslims enter paradise following death. He was shot dead by police in the grounds of Parliament. Formerly known as Adrian Elms, it is known that he was a Muslim convert and was living in Birmingham when he plotted the atrocity. Police are understood to be aware of who Masood had the telephone conversation with, but decided they had no prior knowledge of the attack and has not been radicalised. Anti-terror police arrested a number of people who were all later released without charge, including members of Masood's family. So far, there has been no direct evidence originating from Masood himself which details why he carried out the attack. We've noticed you're adblocking.

Westminster attack: One year on In the following months, 22 people were killed in the Manchester arena suicide bombing, eight died in the London Bridge attack, and a man was killed when Darren Osborne rammed a van into a crowd at Finsbury Park mosque. There was also a botched attempt to bomb a Tube train at Parsons Green, which injured 30 people. Today Theresa May, Ms Rudd and the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, attended a service at St Mary Undercroft chapel in Parliament. Ms Rudd expressed sympathy for victims and praised those who sought to help them. In an article for the Standard she warned that further action was needed to stop radicalisers from inspiring more attacks. I will be remembering the bravery of our emergency services, including Pc Keith Palmer who made the ultimate sacrifice. And I will be thinking of those left behind whose lives have been forever changed. When our values come under attack that is the time when we must commit more than ever to that which unites us. We are proud to live in a decent, open and respectful society. Terrorists want to attack our way of life and cause maximum disruption in society. They thrive over the divisions their actions cause and hope that we respond with panic. Daesh want nothing more than for all British Muslims to feel under attack in this country too. This only helps to feed a grievance narrative that is deployed by predatory recruiters. That is why it is important to tackle all forms of terrorism, whether Islamist or far-Right. We need to respond by stamping out those recruiters, whether it is an Islamist terrorist disseminating material that inspires and instructs how to carry out an attack, or a racist who uses Westminster to provide justification for further acts of cruelty and hatred. We cannot only deal with those who have been already been drawn into terrorist activity. We need to intervene earlier and stop people being radicalised in the first place. We cannot be complacent. Westminster was the first of five attacks in this country last year, including three more in our capital at London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green. But we must recognise the professionalism of those who are protecting us and the 10 Islamist terrorist plots and four far-Right terrorist plots that have been thwarted since March last year. As I make my way to Westminster today I will see Londoners and tourists enjoying the sights and freedom this great city has to offer. And I will remember how we all came together to stand united against the terrorists. This is something to be proud of. We will not be defeated.

A car mounted the sidewalk and plowed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge leading to multiple serious injuries with one death arleady confirmed. A knife-wielding attacker was killed after stabbing a policeman. Here are some eyewitness accounts. And he set about one of the policeman with what looked like a stick. The policeman fell over on the ground and it was pretty horrible to watch. Then having done that, he disengaged and ran towards the House of Commons entrance used by MPs and he got about 20 yards or so when two plainclothes guys with guns shot him. And I have to say that they were very quick to run out of wherever they ran out of and ran towards him and they did the shooting pose with their legs straight and one leg in front of the other. He ran in through the open gates. These are the gates where people drive in and out of the Parliamentary Estate and they are manned by uniformed policeman. The gates were open and this man ran through. John Campbell, who witnessed events from a passing bus told the Telegraph: I was upstairs on the number 88 bus which was stuck in a traffic jam on parliament square when I saw a lot of people running up from Westminster Bridge. I then saw a man running with a very large kitchen knife. He was running really fast and went straight past the guards at the gate. I then saw him stab a police officer two or three times. His colleague then intervened and the officer managed to stagger away. I then heard two neat shots and the man went down. I was ushered onto Westminster Bridge and looked onto the west pavement of the bridge and literally north to south I must have counted 8-10 prostrate figures on the ground. There was smoke coming from underneath the bonnet. I saw a pedestrian or a cyclist who had clearly been hit. The driver of the car sprinted away from the scene. That was followed by four what sounded very much like gunshots. Then all of a sudden all hell was let loose and police descended everywhere. The whole area was locked down. Kevin Schofield, editor of Politics Home was in parliament at the time of the attack. Writing on Twitter: Then there were gunshots and lots of armed police running around everywhere.

He said he was struck by three images from yesterday. The first is of a vehicle being driven across Westminster Bridge by someone who had a perverted, nihilistic, despairing view of objectives of what life is about, of what this society is about, that could only be fulfilled by death and destruction. The second is of that same person a few minutes later on a stretcher or on the ground being treated by the very people he had sought to kill. The third is of these two houses, where profound disagreement, bitter disagreement, angry disagreement, is dealt with not with violence, not with despair, not with cruelty, but with discussion, with reason, and with calmness. That was shown yesterday, hat is shown not just in our expression of values but in our practices which define those values and that is the mood that we must show in the future. Justin Welby, archbishop of Canterbury. About 3,000 Britons, mainly Islamists, are monitored because police suspect they might be capable of an attack. Of them, 500 are the subject of active investigations and only a limited number of those become the targets of physical surveillance. The Guardian understands that the attacker was not one of them. He did not even make the list of 3,000. Updated at 8.41am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 8.27am EDT 08:27 Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has been speaking to US news show Morning Joe. He says the attacker was known to police and MI5, as May said earlier this morning. I think what I can say about the individual concerned is that his values, his idea of the world will not prevail. He launched an attack at the heart of our democracy as has happened many times in the last decades. The values of that Palace of Westminster will continue to triumph and whatever he thought he was doing, he will not succeed. London Mayor Boris Johnson responds to London attack and Theresa May's address before Parliament. March 23, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus 8.22am EDT 08:22 Islamic State claims responsibility for Westminster attack Amaq, the news agency used by Isis to broadcast propaganda, says that the group is responsible for the attack. This is a claim by them, which obviously cannot be verified at this stage. The wording of the Isis statement suggests he was inspired, rather than directed by them but we have no confirmation on either front.

The tribute to Keith and the police are that we are here today and our proceedings are going on. I do hope that at an appropriate time, with discussion with the family, that we too may be able to look at a lasting memorial to Keith in order that each and every one of us know that there are people putting their lives on the line for our democracy today.

Updated at 9.26am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 8.05am EDT 08:05 In the Commons Theresa May has now finished her statement. She says many MSPs have friends and even family members working in Westminster. They were shocked by what happened, she says. She says her thoughts and prayers are with the family of PC Keith Palmer. And she praises the bravery of all those who serve in the police. She says she was updated by Police Scotland yesterday, and again this morning. There is no evidence of a threat to Scotland. But, as a precautionary measure, policing has been increased, she says. She says the only people to blame for acts of terrorism are those who perpetrate them. She says she wants to echo the words of Theresa May: terrorists seek to undermine our values, but they will not succeed, she says.

With heads bowed, MPs from different parties stood side-by-side along the green benches to pay their respects ahead of digital, culture, media and sport questions.

The ceremony in Westminster Hall was held to mark the first anniversary of the attack and was attended by politicians, senior police officers and people involved in the incident.

MP Tobias Ellwood broke down on television today as he recalled the moment he comforted his young son after he had tried in vain to save the life of Pc Palmer in the Palace of Westminster. Mr Ellwood was in Parliament when terrorist Khalid Masood launched his sickening attack, mowing down and killing four pedestrians before stabbing unarmed Pc Palmer as he stood guard. In an emotionally-charged interview one year on, the politician fought back tears as he recounted the conversation he had with his son in the wake of the atrocity. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood pictured at the scene as he desperately tried to save PC Palmer MPs observed a minute's silence in memory of those killed in the 2017 Westminster terror attack in the House of Commons this morning MEMORIALS TO HONOUR OFFICERS AND TERROR VICTIMS Pc Palmer's name will be one of 1,400 inscribed on a new UK Police Memorial commemorating officers killed on duty. Another 4,000 of those who died on duty will be remembered inside the memorial in Staffordshire. Plans have also been revealed for a memorial for victims and survivors of the four terrorist atrocities that took place in the city last year - at Westminster Bridge, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green. Well-wishers will be able to leave messages in a digital book of hope at City Hall from today. Five innocent people were killed in Masood's rampage - 48-year-old Pc Palmer, US tourist Kurt Cochran, Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, 31, and Britons Aysha Frade, 44, and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes, who were mown down on the bridge. Mr Ellwood told the BBC: 'The other reflection and vivid image I have is returning home after what had happened and finding my son on the top of the stairs. 'He was in tears and he was just on his own. 'He couldn't understand why I had stepped forward, why someone had been killed, why someone was yielding a knife in a place that he had visited so many times. In a statement released through Scotland Yard, Pc Shaun Cartwright said: 'Keith loved being a police officer, he just wanted to help people and do his best. 'Keith was always happy, always the first to help anyone out, first in to work and the last one out. 'He was a proud and courageous police officer who did his job and never wanted any fuss or to be the centre of attention. Keith was a true and loyal friend, utterly reliable. Mr Ellwood, a former Army officer whose brother Jonathan was killed in the 2002 Bali terror atrocity, has paid tribute to the police for their work in a country 'that seems to be getting more dangerous and more volatile'. The Defence Minister said the threats faced by the UK were not going away and involved not just terrorism but 'resurgent nations challenging the world order'. He also recounted the moment of the attack on ITV's Lorraine. This harrowing picture of Mr Ellwood as he and members of the emergency services desperately tried to save Pc Palmer's life became one of the defining images of the attack Pc Palmer (pictured posing for a photo at the Palace of Westminster), was 'a proud and courageous police officer who did his job and never wanted any fuss', his friend has said MET POLICE PAY TRIBUTE TO VICTIMS The Metropolitan Police posted a message from Commissioner Cressida Dick today. It read: '22nd March 2017 is a day that remains vivid in many of our minds. Our thoughts are also with all those who died that day or whose lives were turned upside down.' 'Aysha Frade; Keith Palmer; Kurt Cochran; Leslie Rhodes and Andreea Cristea. All of whom remain much loved and missed by their families and loved ones. Today it is only natural for many of us to stop and pause and remember in our own way. 'The horror of that day was marked by acts of astonishing compassion and bravery as those who responded rushed to help the injured; to comfort those in distress and to bring calm to chaos.' 'I know that today we will remember, those taken from us, those who were injured and all those that day has had a lasting impact on. We owe it to them to carry on with courage, professionalism and determination; to do our very best to prevent future attacks and keep people safe.' Mr Ellwood told the host today: 'Huge respect to all police officers, because they don't know how their day is going to unfold and they just go to work and get on with it. 'I saw PC Keith Palmer lying there and could see he had lost a lot of blood and that's when I stepped forward to try and help. 'I just recall how professional the police were in moving into a situation where they were taking control and command of everything up to the silence of what is usually a busy place, until there was no-one around except for police. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with PC Palmer's friends and family. He did what he loved doing. He applied to stay on and do this work and loved every minute of it. 'We know these police officers well. They are part of the fabric of the community, so it is one of ours - it felt. 'But there was this feeling that we will not be cowed by this. We will not let this affect us. Life goes on. The next day, Parliament did sit - we weren't going to stop. 'Likewise, these terrorist activities try to rip us apart but they do they do the opposite. He added: 'When we go back to when I first became aware of terrorism was the loss of my brother in 2002 (in the Bali bombings). 'Fifteen years ago and today these attacks are still taking place. We are going through a very dangerous and volatile period. Or do we see where things are going wrong. Al Shabab or Boko Haram or Al Qaeda - all these flourish where there isn't any governance. 'Not only that, the religion of Islam itself is being used - a peaceful religion - these terrorists have scant understanding of it and think they are going to paradise for what they do and that's the work that we need to embark on. 'There is a determination that we will not be defeated. And we walk by that location every day - it's right by the main entrance so all MPs are very conscious. Let's not forget Jo Cox was killed by an extremist too and her plaque is inside the chamber itself which we all look at. 'We live in a very dangerous world and it's up to us to work out the strategy we're going to hold in order to stand up to our values which we've spent decades, millennia, developing.

Picture: AFP. Seven people were arrested earlier on Thursday following six raids in Westminster. Four people died, including the gunman, and at least 40 others were injured, with seven of them in a critical condition. The authorities say the attacker drove his car into pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer. He was later shot dead. London police say more arrests are expected in connection with the terror attack. The Metropolitan Police Service's Mark Rowley says police had searched addresses in London, Birmingham and other parts of the country in their investigation. He said there was a mix of nationalities among the dead but gave no details. The victims were a policeman who was stabbed and two members of the public, a woman in her mid-40s and a man in his mid-50s. The fourth casualty was the assailant. Police believe they know the identity of the attacker but have not named him. The attack on Wednesday started when the assailant sped across Westminster Bridge in a car, ramming pedestrians along the way. He then ran towards parliament and stabbed the policeman before he was shot. Three French high-school students aged 15 or 16, who were on a school trip to London with fellow students from Brittany, were among the injured. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was expected to arrive in London to visit them at hospital, French media reported. Westminster Bridge remained cordoned off with a strong police presence. The nearby Westminster underground train station, normally a busy hub in the morning rush hour, was not accessible from street level as it was within the cordon. WATCH: Witnesses describe 'horrendous' London attack Prime Minister Theresa May has called the policeman who died in the line of duty a hero. Additional police officers have been deployed to step up patrols on the streets of London. Parliament was due to convene later in what May said late on Wednesday was a sign that the attack would not disrupt British democracy or normal life in the capital.

Reports have emerged that his birthname was Adrian Russell Ajao. He was earlier named as Adrian Elms. Fifty people have been confirmed as injured, with 31 requiring hospital treatment. Two police officers remained in hospital with significant injuries. He was a peripheral figure. The names of two people who died after Masood mowed them down on Westminster Bridge also emerged. They were Kurt Cochran, 54, a US tourist from Utah celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary, and British-born Aysha Frade, 43, who worked at sixth-form college and had been walking over the bridge to pick up her daughters from school. In the frenzied attack on Wednesday, Masood also stabbed to death PC Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old husband and father. The attack was stopped when armed officers assigned to protect the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, shot Masood, who is believed to have been intent on entering parliament. Palmer died at New Palace Yard on the edge of the parliamentary estate, near Parliament Square, raising questions about security for legislators. In an emergency statement to the Commons, May said people from around the world had been caught up in the attack. She later visited the injured in hospital. Police said Masood had been inspired by Islamic State. But he hid his extremism from his neighbours, coming across as a keen gardener and family man. The domestic intelligence service will face questions over why Masood dropped off the radar after being investigated in relation to concerns over violent extremism. An MI5 team has been set up to see what lessons can be learned from the case and to look at the decision to not put him under surveillance. The police and security services monitor an estimated 3,000 Britons, mainly Islamists, regarded as capable of terrorism, but it emerged he was not on this list. Isis claimed responsibilty for the attack, although the claim could not be verified. Amaq, the news agency it uses to broadcast propaganda, issued a statement describing the attacker as a soldier of Islamic State, without naming him. Police revealed that Masood, born in Kent on Christmas Day 1964, had a string of criminal convictions. Map Neighbour Iwona Romek said Masood was a keen gardener, who lived in the modern mews house with his wife and young child. It is believed that Masood rented the Hyundai car that he turned into a weapon of terror from the depot of a car hire firm, Enterprise, in Spring Hill, Birmingham. Police still believe the attack was carried out by Masood alone, but are looking into whether others helped him. The eight arrests were all on suspicion of acts of preparation of a terrorist act, a key indication that police are investigating the possibility of a wider conspiracy. A 39-year-old woman was arrested in east London, while two women aged 26 and 21 were detained in Birmingham. Five men aged 23, 26, 27, 28 and 58 were arrested in Birmingham. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will be deeply missed. The Met has put extra officers on the streets and has extended the shifts they work from eight to 12 hours, until further notice. Forces outside London are also increasing their presence on the streets, to provide reassurance and to deter not only any further Islamist attacks but hate crimes against Muslims. The Independent Police Complaints Commission began an investigation into the shooting of the suspect, which is mandated by law. All rights reserved."}

I want to express my heartfelt condolences to his family, his colleagues and his friends at this incredibly difficult time. A highly decorated old soldier has joined calls for murdered PC Keith Palmer to be given a posthumous medal in recognition of his bravery. Bob Filby, 93, who was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery during heavy fighting in the Second World War, said PC Palmer should be posthumously given the George Cross, a gallantry medal. Yesterday hundreds of people descended on Parliament to pay their respects to the officer as well as the three other victims of Masood. Thousands of bouquets lined the streets where the horror unfolded, while many adorned the railings surrounding the Palace of Westminster. He is a hero.

Westminster attack: car hire firms urged to tell police about suspicious customers Read more After four days of intensive inquiries across England and Wales, involving hundreds of officers, the Metropolitan police said they had so far failed to establish the reason for the attack. Although 11 people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack, nine have since been released, with no further action to be taken. A 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham remained in custody on Saturday while a 32-year-old woman from Manchester has been released on bail. The police statement confirming that he was a lone actor does not appear to support suggestions that he had been in touch with an accomplice. He left the car at 14:40:51 and was shot by a police firearms officer, part of the close protection team of the defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, in the palace courtyard at 14:41:30. At 14:40:59, the first 999 call was made to the Met reporting the incident. Basu said the investigation was continuing and appealed for anyone who had spoken to Masood in recent months, especially in the days leading up to the attack, to contact the police. He praised the way London and communities throughout the rest of the country had come together and that there had been no backlash. A very small minority of people have tried to use this as an opportunity to stir up hate, but once again we stand together in calm defiance. It is common for converts to Islam such as Masood to seek work in Saudi Arabia. Fifteen people are still being treated in hospital. All rights reserved."}

Up to 40 people were injured when a lone terrorist attacked Westminster, stabbing a police officer to death as he tried to storm parliament, and killing three members of the public as he careered through the heart of the capital in a 4x4 vehicle.

People fled for their lives as a Hyundai 4x4 driven by the terrorist at about 2.40pm indiscriminately ran into people on Westminster Bridge. The use of the vehicle to attack civilians was a direct copy of an Islamic State tactic used previously with murderous effect in Nice and Berlin. The vehicle then careered off the road on to pavement a few metres away from Big Ben and the attacker tried to storm parliament armed with a knife. The attacker, dressed in black, was shot by another armed officer and died of his injuries. The attacker was already known to counter-terrorism officials. Police chiefs have ordered extra officers, armed and unarmed, on to the streets of the capital.

Rob Lyon, 34, from Rugby, was walking along Westminster Bridge with a colleague when he saw a 4x4 vehicle travelling at high speed, hitting pedestrians. A colleague I was with, James, I heard him sort of shout. I instinctively jumped off the pavement. I could see people being hit. A woman was pulled alive from the Thames with serious injuries after having fallen into the water during the attack. The car then sped towards the Palace of Westminster, and came to a halt on the pavement, up against railings to the north of New Palace Yard, the green space adjacent to Big Ben, opposite an entrance to Westminster tube station. A man with a knife was then seen running through the gates of the Palace of Westminster, across New Palace Yard and stabbing a police officer. The attacker continued his rampage, targeting a second officer, according to witnesses. But he was shot by police as he approached, knife in hand. Witness Rick Longley said he saw the car crash into the railings and a man leaping out. UK terror attacks since 11 September 2001 Read more In the aftermath of the attack, Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood helped treat the injured officer, unsuccessfully trying to resuscitate him. The Bournemouth MP, a former soldier, was pictured with blood on his forehead, helping the police officer in Parliament Square. Two people could be seen lying within New Palace Yard, immediately outside Westminster Hall. The sitting in the House of Commons was suspended while police officers sealed off the area. Parliamentary staff were told to stay in their offices. Minutes after the incident, an air ambulance landed in Parliament Square, as sirens were heard outside, but the officer could not be saved. Up to 1,000 people were evacuated at various locations, including Westminster Abbey. It took several hours for parliament to be evacuated. The ambulance service said eight of those injured were treated at the scene. We pay tribute, too, to the police and emergency services who handled this with bravery. We always have, and we always will. The headline of this article was changed on 23 March 2017 after the death toll from the terrorist attack was revised downwards from five to four.

Known as Carriage Gates, the entrance is generally monitored by police officers. In any case, the existing security procedures likely minimised the impact of the attack, which could have been even worse and more deadly. As it was, a terrorist drove a vehicle down a Westminster Bridge pavement crowded with pedestrians and into a perimeter fence. Getting out of the car, the man stabbed the first officer he encountered after entering the unlocked gate; the officer later died of his wounds. Five people were killed, including the attacker, who was shot to death. Twenty-nine were wounded, including seven reported in critical condition. The low-tech, rudimentary nature of the attack is another reminder of the changing face of terrorism The changing face of terrorism The low-tech, rudimentary nature of the attack is another reminder of the changing face of terrorism. Previous emphasis on elaborate, carefully planned attacks seems to have given way to a more barebones approach to creating terror: Simply drive a vehicle into a crowd of people. Planning more elaborate attacks tends to involve more people and could leave an electronic trail to enable security and anti-terrorism agencies to uncover plots before they can be carried out. In contrast, driving a vehicle into a crowd is easier, might involve fewer perpetrators and likely needs little advanced planning. Successful detection of more elaborate plots has led terrorism groups to resort to the simpler route. Several terrorist-related web sites have reportedly encouraged followers to use vehicles as weapons of terrorism. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the London attack. The plan was simple and almost undetectable until it happened. Vehicle barriers Vehicle barriers can help prevent such attacks, whether concrete or moveable bollards, steel fencing, crash-rated portable barriers, or other measures. They are currently used all over the world, including government buildings and high-profile locales where pedestrians might gather. The Elysee Palace is fortified by high walls and steel fences and is restricted from traffic and protected by armed patrols For example, Berlin's Reichstag has fences in front of the building's main entrance and is surrounded by low concrete blocks, although it is largely accessible to the public with no fences on the other sides. The European Parliament headquarters in Brussels is protected by low steel bollards on the roadside, and the French National Assembly's front gates are protected by concrete bollards to prevent high-speed ramming. France's Elysee Palace is fortified by high walls and steel fences, and is restricted from traffic and protected by armed patrols. Vehicle traffic around the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., is restricted; steel railings several feet high, also encircled by steel bollards and chains, protect the perimeter of the White House. Such venues will be the subject of new security evaluations, even as Britons look for answers about how the latest attack could have been prevented. The challenge is that any weak spot could be the point of entry for the next tragedy. eyes and ears in the fast-changing security marketplace, attending industry and corporate events, interviewing security leaders and contributing original editorial content to the site. A new layout and hall numbering system will be unfamiliar to past attendees but promises to simplify the experience as it brings together attendees and exhibitors. European physical security market Security Essen is an international trade fair, but the emphasis is more on German, Austrian and Swiss companies. In all, Security Essen will feature 1,000 exhibitors from 40 nations. At the last Security Essen in 2016, organisers reported about 40,000 visitors including conference participants, VIP guests, members of various delegations and journalists. Newly modernised Messe Essen The newly modernised site of Security Essen will encompass eight halls, newly renumbered and with the subject areas reorganised, too. Visitors will find Services in Hall 1; Access, Mechanatronics, Mechanics and Systems in Halls 2 and 3 and the Galeria; Perimeter Protection in Hall 3; Video in Halls 5 and 7; and Fire, Intrusion and Systems in Halls 6 and 7. A helpful smart phone app, downloadable free from the Google Play Store (Android) or the Apple App Store (iOS), will be available two weeks before the event and include a show floor plan; the exhibitor list with booth numbers and contact information; and an overview of the supporting programme. Cyber Security Conference At the new Cyber Security Conference, located prominently at the new East Entrance, experts will share their knowledge about the more pressing challenges and potential of cybersecurity. The fair organises the conference in cooperation with the BHE Federal Association of Security Technology and the technical support of the Federal Office for Information Security. The products and solutions will be installed in four different building scenarios (town hall, school, hospital and library) and it will be possible to test them extensively. The forum, including lectures and discussions, will target municipal decision makers and planners of public spaces. Comprehensive programme A Security Expert Forum in Hall 2 will present a continuous programme with more than 90 presentations during the period of the fair. Visitors will obtain information and solution ideas about all six subject areas covered at the fair, and the programme will begin with a keynote lecture each morning and finish with a live demonstration in the evening. Targeted and professional communication will be established between companies and job applicants to facilitate making contacts, developing networks, and filling actual vacancies. Thursday (27 September) will be observed as Fire Prevention Day, and a Drone Course will be provided each day in Hall 7. Advance sale tickets are discounted. Steps to develop an integrated retail security strategy There are many aspects to consider when developing a retail security strategy, including loss prevention, physical security, asset protection, risk management, and IT. All these areas could be the responsibility of just a few people working to secure a handful of stores or each of these areas could be entirely separate departments, as is often the case for major retailers with locations throughout the country. Regardless of the size of the retailer, there are many different technologies that can be used within a retail store to improve security and loss prevention, yet none should be used in a silo. There are tremendous benefits to integrating security technologies and communications systems together, including enhancing overall safety and security, reducing shrink, and improving operations. There are many different technologies that can be used within a retail store to improve security and loss prevention As the existing security infrastructure is evaluated and plans for the future are developed, the team responsible should consider some of the following questions. Understanding current pain points within the stores and how integrated security solutions can address these is the key to implementing the best solution. Integrated systems enhance security at these locations. Video recording of HD or megapixel cameras integrated with point of sale data makes it easy to locate video associated with transactions and exception reporting. This allows for visual verification of each transaction when needed.There are tremendous benefits to integrating security technologies and communications systems together Other risks like robbery not only result in loss, but also impact the safety of employees and shoppers alike. Panic buttons or bill trap sensors connected to the intrusion detection system ensure silent alarms are issued when employees are at risk. When the intrusion detection system is integrated with the video system, pressing a panic button or pulling the bill from the sensor can automatically trigger a video snapshot to be sent to the monitoring station to provide verification of the alarm and more information for law enforcement when they are dispatched. If no security guard is onsite, video monitoring services can allow the monitoring centre to intervene through audio, alerting the perpetrator that his or her actions are being monitored and that the authorities have been contacted. This may cause the offender to flee the area, helping to mitigate the safety risk as well as the potential for loss. Panic buttons or bill trap sensors connected to the intrusion detection system ensure silent alarms are issued when employees are at risk High value displays Protect high-value or frequently-stolen items such as electronics, using video analytics integrated with audio communication Protect high-value or frequently-stolen items such as electronics, using video analytics integrated with audio communications. Cash office An access control reader at the door to the cash office restricts access to only authorised individuals. For example, the intrusion detection system can monitor doors for abnormal conditions, even when the system is disarmed.Loss can also occur when a cooler or freezer malfunctions or when the door is accidentally left open A door left open for longer than a pre-defined time can cause an alarm on the intrusion panel, which can trigger a nearby camera to send a snapshot of the open door to the store manager and trigger the public address system to play a pre-recorded message through a nearby speaker. This prompts the employee to close the door, reducing risk of theft. Loss can also occur when a cooler or freezer malfunctions or when the door of one of these units is accidentally left open. The same concept for monitoring exit doors can also apply to doors for coolers and freezers to prevent spoilage. A cooler or freezer door monitored by the intrusion detection system can trigger an alert or chime to play in the area to remind an employee to close the door or to alert the store manager to the issue. While providing surveillance of the cash register area, the camera's video analytics can be used to trigger an alert in case the queue exceeds the pre-defined threshold Serving a dual purpose Retailers can use the metadata from the cameras to gather business statistics like counts of people entering the store While the technology solutions described above positively impact loss prevention in a retail store, they can also extend beyond security to improve health and safety and enhance customer service as well as customer engagement and sales. This data can help them understand peak days and times when making decisions about staffing. Or while providing surveillance of the cash register area, the camera's video analytics can also be used to trigger an alert in case the number of people in a queue exceeds the pre-defined threshold. At this point, the same public address system and loudspeakers used to play background music to enhance the shopping experience could be activated to broadcast a message to request another cash register to be opened, improving store operations. For security and loss prevention purposes, video analytics can also be used to ensure that no one enters or leaves the retail shop using the emergency exit. This information can be used by merchandisers to evaluate the success of displays and store layouts, which directly impacts customer engagement and sales. When systems are used for and deliver data for purposes beyond security, other departments may be willing to contribute toward the cost of the system. This provides an added benefit by relieving some of the cost burden from security or other operational budgets. Product selection Integration is becoming easier using standards and expanding industry partnerships. However, in some cases, choosing systems from a single vendor that are designed to work together can help to speed and simplify installation, while also reducing system costs for both the integrator and the user. Regardless of the products chosen, it will be important for a retailer with many locations to have consistency in the type of equipment installed at each site. This makes support easier and enables a more uniform response to incidents that happen at various stores. As many retailers already understand, there is no silver bullet to reducing loss. However, a combination of the right technologies working together to prevent shrink and improve investigative capabilities can result in smarter and more effective loss prevention. GSX 2018 continues 63-year tradition as an integrated trade show GSX 2018 is both a new event for the security industry and the continuation of a 63-year tradition. In recent years, the ASIS event has joined forces with other organisations to expand its scope and to appeal to a broader audience. Partners include ISSA (Information Systems Security Association) and Infragard, a public-private partnership between U.S. businesses and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Improving the state of cyber security Held September 23-27 at the Las Vegas convention Center, GSX 2018 seeks to attract more than 20,000 operational and cyber security professionals and 550 exhibitors. The Cyber Security Summit will co-locate with GSX, offering cyber security programming at a time when it is needed the most. Top government, industry and academic thought leaders will engage in a dialogue to improve the state of cyber security. The 2018 Security Cares Program will address school violence prevention and response in a free education program. Topics will include pre-violence indicators, target hardening, and best practices to involve the entire community of school administrators, law enforcement, security professionals and mental health providers. Experts to deliver keynote speeches Keynote speakers including CNN host Fareed Zakaria will bestow celebrity appeal. Air Force Major General Bradley D. Spacy will share details about the new AFWERX innovation and tech hub in Las Vegas and how the U.S. Air Force is collaborating with the private sector to bring new security product ideas to market. Historically, the trade show aspect has existed separately from the educational program, and foot traffic to the exhibits has sometimes suffered from the competition. Beginning last year, and continuing in 2018, ASIS International has pursued innovative approaches to integrate the trade show more closely into the overall attendee experience. GSX 2018 this year may face even more scrutiny based on the changes, rebranding, and location (also in Las Vegas). However, GSX is a completely different show than ISC West, which focuses on the business of security. In contrast, GSX is much more about the practice of security than business. The international network of ASIS International members attend the yearly conference to make new connections, to learn and to benefit from the experiences of other security professionals around the world. The successful trade show exhibitors are the ones that approach the show with that understanding. GSX is not as much about sales leads as about making connections and contributing to a larger conversation about how to protect people, facilities and assets. ASIS International deserves credit for their efforts to integrate the trade show element into the larger goal of the event. our dedicated portal for our Americas audience."}

His legal teams also said Mr Ali considered it 'a barbarous and cruel act of murder for which there was no possible justification or mitigation'. In 2009 it emerged that Mr Ali, then an IT worker and president of the Civil Service Islamic Society, was suspended on full pay for six months following comments on his blog. In one post Mr Ali quoted an interview with an Islamic militant who said: 'If I saw an American or British man wearing a soldier's uniform inside Iraq I would kill him because that is my obligation. 'If I found the same soldier in Jordan I wouldn't touch him. In Iraq he is a fighter and an occupier, here he is not. Sir Gus O'Donnell, then Britain's most senior civil servant and patron of the Civil Service Islamic Society, ordered that Mr Ali be suspended while an investigation was carried out. Six months later the investigation finished and Mr Ali returned to his job. His group Mend works with politicians on all sides, the police and the CPS to enhance the engagement of British Muslims in UK life. Mend relies on donations for funding and online it quotes the Koran saying: 'And whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah's Cause), He will replace it' Today The Times made a number of claims about the organisation. The newspaper also claims that The Charity Commission will speak to three charities over their funding of Mend speaking events. At one an Islamic speaker considered to have extreme views told the audience that killing comes easily to 'the children of Israel'. The Times also claims that Mend targeted the NSPCC and used social media to send them angry messages because the children's charity set up a hotline for families to report children if they feared they were being radicalised.

Westminster terror attack suspect was British-born married father of 3, Khalid Masood Jake Kanter Mar. 23, 2017, 11:21 AM createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); Westminster attack suspect. PA The London attack terrorist was named by the Metropolitan Police as Khalid Masood. The 52-year-old married father of 3 was also known as Khalid Choudary. See our updated coverage of Masood's background here. He was a 52-year-old married father of three children, and was a bodybuilder. He was shot dead by police after killing an officer with a knife. Moments earlier he ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in a 4x4 vehicle. He was born in Kent and had previously been investigated by MI5 over concerns relating to violent extremism. It was not known he was planning Wednesday's attack, but police said in a statement he has a range of previous convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm (GBH), possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. He has not been convicted for any terrorism offences. Earlier on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Masood, who was the unnamed at the time, had a history of extremism, and was known to police and intelligence officials. The police have conducted raids at six addresses, including in Birmingham, and made eight arrests. Channel 4 names the wrong man The attacker was briefly identified by Channel 4 News on Wednesday evening as a prominent British-born Islamist extremist, but the broadcaster later reversed its report after other journalists disputed it on Twitter. ABC journalist Rym Momtaz echoed this account, saying she had spoken with the person's solicitor on Wednesday. Channel 4 News later acknowledged the error made in its 7 p.m. bulletin. Editor Ben de Pear said award-winning reporter Simon Israel named the wrong man, but he did not apologise for the mistake. A Press Association photographer took images of the suspect in the attack receiving medical assistance outside the Palace of Westminster. Sprawled metres away from the slain police officer, the man died from his gunshot wounds. Moments earlier, a police officer could be seen standing over the man with his firearm. He appeared to be standing on a knife, possibly the one used in the attack. All rights reserved.

London has been a target for terrorism many times over past decades. Wednesday was the anniversary of suicide bombings in the Brussels airport and subway that killed 32 people last year, and the latest events echoed recent vehicle attacks in Berlin and Nice, France. In the House of Commons, legislators were holding a series of votes on pensions when deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced that the sitting was being suspended and told lawmakers not to leave. Parliament was locked down for several hours, and the adjoining Westminster subway station was shuttered. Conservative lawmaker Tobias Ellwood, whose brother was killed in the Bali terror attack in 2002, performed first aid on the wounded police officer, who later died. About 10 yards away lay the assailant. The attack began early Wednesday afternoon as a driver in a gray SUV slammed into pedestrians on the bridge linking Parliament to the south bank of the River Thames. One man was bleeding from his head. Ambulances arrived within minutes to treat people who lay scattered along the length of the bridge. One bloodied woman lay surrounded by a scattering of postcards. Police said one injured woman was pulled from the river. The car crashed into railings on the north side of the bridge, less than 200 yards (meters) from the entrance to Parliament. As people scattered in panic, witnesses saw a man holding a knife run toward the building. I have never seen anything like that.

And so they do because they are our values too. We stand, all of us, with the UK. Comforted that we share those values. Freedom of speech, democracy, the rule of law. We will never give in to terror.

Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says the injured person lives in South Australia. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace.

The notion that these London-based friends were somehow in peril from an attack that was neutralised many hours ago seemed absurd to me in London. The attack on the Palace of Westminster was grave and tragic, but, as rapidly became apparent, it was also crudely undertaken and successfully contained by the police and emergency services. Four people died during the atrocity, 29 people were injured. March 22, 2017 The problem is one of scale. This is especially the case for places such as Westminster or the City of London, which ebb and flow with the tide of civil servants or bankers each day. Their friends were probably compelled to enquire after Facebook chose to turn on Safety Check, the action sowing a seed of doubt. When it was launched in 2014, Safety Check was intended as a tool to let loved ones know you are safe during a natural disaster. Facebook first turned Safety Check on for a terror attack after the Paris attacks in November 2015. As much as it was praised for its role in the French capital, it was pilloried for not using the feature for other, non-western attacks. In March 2016, Facebook pushed its Safety Check notification following a suicide bombing in Lahore to users as far away as Hawaii, New York and the UK. But the link was to a video from August 2015. The problem of how to judge whether an attack is of a large enough scale is a tricky one for Facebook. Algorithmically, turning it on made perfect sense. Yesterday, feeds inevitably filled with people sharing information about their whereabouts and news articles as events unfolded in Westminster. There is no doubt that for many Londoners the simple act of checking in that you were safe allayed the fears of far-off loved ones. But it also spread unnecessary worry about people who were simply nowhere near the affected area. All rights reserved."}

The full details of exactly what happened are still emerging. But, having been updated by police and security officials, I can confirm that this appalling incident began when a single attacker drove his vehicle into pedestrians walking across Westminster bridge, killing two people and injuring many more, including three police officers. This attacker, who was armed with a knife, then ran towards Parliament, where he was confronted by the police officers who keep us and our democratic institutions safe. Tragically, one officer was killed. The terrorist was also shot dead. Acting deputy commissioner Rowley will give a further operational update later this evening. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all who have been affected; to the victims themselves and their family and friends who waved their loved ones off, but will not now be welcoming them home. For those of us who were in Parliament at the time of this attack, these events provide a particular reminder of the exceptional bravery of our police and security services who risk their lives to keep us safe. Once again today, these exceptional men and women ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way. On behalf of the whole country, I want to pay tribute to them and to all our emergency services for the work they have been doing to reassure the public and bring security back to the streets of our capital city. The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city, where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech. That is why it is a target for those who reject those values. But let me make it clear today, as I have had cause to do before: any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to failure. Tomorrow morning, Parliament will meet as normal. We will come together as normal. And Londoners - and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great city - will get up and go about their day as normal. They will board their trains, they will leave their hotels, they will walk these streets, they will live their lives. And we will all move forward together. Never giving in to terror.

Police were called to an incident at Parliament square in central London at 14.40 (GMT). An attacker drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing at least two and seriously injuring others. A badly-injured woman was rescued from the Thames. The attacker then crashed into the railing of the Houses of Parliament, before attacking a police officer inside the gate of the Houses of Parliament. The police officer died of his injuries. His assailant was shot and killed by police. MP Tobias Ellwood attempted to resuscitate the officer, but he died at the scene. A group of French students and students from the north West of England were among the injured. Five London hospitals treated casualties: hospital officials said 12 people were treated for serious injuries, eight more were treated for less serious injuries at the scene. Large areas of central London were shut off to the public, and workers in the Palace of Westminster, including MPs were placed in lockdown for several hours. All rights reserved."}

It was not just Britain First and the English Defence League which tried to make political capital out of the deadly attacks in Westminster on 22 March. UK-based politicians and international figures were not slow to add their very unhelpful pennyworths to the supposed analysis of what had gone wrong. At first politicians were blaming migration, as well as asylum policies. When it emerged that the perpetrator, Khalid Masood, was British, politicians shifted their attack to failed multiculturalism. Just hours after the Westminster attacks, Donald Trump Jr. implied in a tweet that London Mayor Sadiq Khan was weak on terrorism. Nothing at all to do with what had happened at Westminster that day. Foreign politicians were quick to seize on the event to justify repressive policies at home. It does not seem to matter that the perpetrator of the Westminster attacks was neither an asylum seeker nor an immigrant, or that he was found not to be connected to any terrorist group. The event had provided the occasion for rightists the world over to vindicate their positions in the public narrative.

At one stage during the brief security lapse, a courier on a moped even appears to enter the grounds unchallenged. Metres from the scene, at the same time, Theresa May was rushed from the scene in a waiting car. Following the attack, MPs have called for a review of the security arrangement around Parliament. Parliament's main entrance has two sets of large metal gates which allow vehicles to enter and exit the estate. A pair of smaller gates were introduced recently with two police officers at each to check passes and allow cyclists, cars and delivery drivers to come in. There are usually armed police present just inside the entrance gate. More armed police are also present after the final checkpoint. AP The latest revelation has raised fresh questions that the terror carnage would have been even worse Labour MP Mary Creagh urged the authorities to step up security following the terror attack. We have four police officers there. Two on the gate going in, two on the gate going out. I think we will need to look at security at the Palace in the wake of this incident but this is a plan for another day. Former Met firearms officer Roger Gay said Britain may now need to move away from the idea of unarmed policeman in important locations.

According to the BBC, Three people have died and at least 40 have been injured after an attacker drove a car along a pavement in Westminster, stabbed a policeman and was shot dead by police in the grounds of Parliament. The dead police officer - who was unarmed as the attacker charged over and stabbed him - is known as PC Keith Palmer, aged 48, a husband and a father. Another victim has been named as 43 year old, mother of two and Spanish language teacher, Aysha Frade. Aysha was mowed down by a the grey Hyundai 4x4 as she walked over Westminster Bridge to collect her two daughters, aged 8 and 11. The third victim was American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was on the final day holiday with his wife celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary when he was killed. At least 40 people are known to have been injured. Among them twelve Britons, four South Koreans, three French youngsters on a school trip, two Romanians, two Greeks, one German, one Polish national, one Irish citizen, one American citizen, one Chinese and one Italian. However, it remains to be seen whether the attack was directed by ISIS , or inspired by them. It seems more likely that it was the latter, not the former. As usual, after every one of these tragedies, we subject ourselves to the same rituals we always go through. It really is tiring and immensely frustrating to see one side act as if there is no problem, or if they do they severely simplify and misdiagnose the problem, while the other side will exploit what is a legitimate issue in order to spread bigotry, hatred and unneccessary, irrational fear. I write this first and foremost as a human being, who has a sense of empathy, compassion and solidarity with my fellow creatures. In the aftermath of every terrorist attack, All of my thoughts and condolences are with the victims and their families, before anything else. They are the ones whose lives have been taken from them, unable to ever embrace their parents, wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, children and friends again. Just imagine being the children of Aysha Frade, eagerly waiting for their mother at school, looking forward to going home to spend time with the family, only to realise that someone had taken her life. Imagine being the wife of PC Palmer, who everyday says goodbye to her husband as he goes off to work always expecting he will return home from his shift safely, but this time, on this day, he doesn't. Nothing is worse than that and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. True, this Jihadist scumbag and his ideological ilk do hate these values and their universality because it is in direct opposition to everything they stand for: one set of values sets the conditions for human flourishing, happiness and emancipation, while the other set can only bring death, misery and enslavement. However, let us have some perspective. No individual, no matter how well armed they are, no matter how determined, no matter how committed he is to his cause, can overthrow democracy or enslave a free people. These hard won rights and liberties that previous generations have struggled for are too robust, too vigarous, too steeped in the consciousness of all generations, to be overthrown by a twisted zealot with a weaponised vehicle, a knife, and a perverse belief in a reward of 72 virgins in a celestial orgy for killing 'the kuffar'. The only way the terrorist would have any impact on democracy and freedom is if we give him an enourmous helping hand. It will be our response as a society to this act of barbarity that will decide whether democracy is under attack or not. You can rest assured vile bigots and Muslimaphobic chauvanists who desire to stigmatise and demonise an entire community, are talking this attack up as an act of war, the latest blow by an Islamic army slowly, stealthily conquering Europe. These merchants of racism from the far-right have no other purpose but to spread irrational fear and hatred. This is of course a total falsehood, London carried on as normal and people were not cowed and went about their business as usual. All these people desire is the power to subjugate and stigmatise muslims, and they seek to undermine the idea that peoples of different faiths can coexist with each other and build a society. I have said it before and I will say it again: do not give me this crap that jihadist atrocities are a response (or shall we say 'blowback') to western imperialism. ISIS are not anti-imperialists, or some strange Islamic version of liberation theology. They are pro-imperialism, they seek to revive a lost empire: their imagined caliphate. This is what their Islamic state project is all about, imposing a purritanical, theocratic fascist empire, first in the muslim world, then across the whole world. Obviously, this project is so utopian and so irrational that it could never be fully established, but let us be clear on their intentions and the character of their ideology. In response to these two pathologies, we cannot surrender ourselves to the culture of fear and the politics of suspicion because it will potentially lead to us down the barren road of petty authoritarianism, the security state and foul assaults on the liberties which supposedly needed to be defended from the Islamist threat. While it is understandable and proper that we focus on the tragic nature of this attack and the challenges around other potential attack it provokes. Let us not forget the bravery, heroism and humanity that was on display in the midst of such savagery and the international solidarity and sympathy. We may have seen the worst of humanity, but we also saw the best of it. Our response to yesterday's assault should be to demand more freedom and democracy, not less. It should be to never allow hatred and fear to colonise our hearts. It should be to remember the victims, their memory and humanise them, as opposed to the manner the terrorist dehumanised them. Ultimately, it is to do everything within our power to make sure that while this bloody, savage act may have succeeded in impacting awfully on scores of innocent people, it will have no impact on our values, our political life, our daily lives, and our sense of security. This, of course, on its own won't solve the challenges the global threat we all face from the Jihadist internationale, but it is neccessary step to even begin dealing with the challenge. We must resist terrorism not complete it. . This story is ugly but I must share it to clear my conscience and pave the way for a new beginning in life.

Two are critical and two are stable St Thomas' Hospital said two patients had been admitted - both are stable The Port of London Authority said a woman was pulled alive from the River Thames near the bridge and was being treated for serious injuries Analysis Image copyright AP Image caption A man believed to be the suspect received medical treatment By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent The incident outside Westminster is exactly the kind of scenario that security chiefs have been planning for. It looks like the type of attack jihadis have wanted to carry out in Britain - namely attacking people with a vehicle and taking on the security forces with knives. That means casualties, as we have seen in Nice and elsewhere, are inevitable. But what matters just as much is how the police then respond. Armed police at Parliament were able to stop the attacker. Within minutes, Westminster was flooded with more armed officers, including counter-terrorism specialists. Inside Scotland Yard, teams of detectives began working on the next critical phase - establishing the suspect's movements, whether he acted alone and, in tandem with their colleagues on the street, making sure London is as secure as it can be in light of these awful events. Westminster remains locked down and it will remain so until Scotland Yard is certain the threat has been contained. 'Screams and commotion' Press Association political editor Andrew Woodcock witnessed the scenes unfolding from his office window overlooking New Palace Yard. 'Mowed down' An eye witness, Radoslaw Sikorski, a senior fellow at Harvard's Centre for European Studies, posted a video to Twitter showing people lying injured in the road on Westminster Bridge.

At least 50 people from 12 different countries were injured when Masood ploughed his rented car into crowds of people walking along the pavement on Westminster Bridge, before crashing the vehicle into the fence outside parliament. Three people on the bridge died after being hit by the speeding car, then the attacker leapt out and fatally stabbed a police officer just inside the gates of the Houses of Parliament before being shot dead. The other victims were 48-year-old policeman Keith Palmer and, on the bridge, 43-year-old Briton Aysha Frade, who was on her way to pick up her two daughters, and an American citizen in his 50s, Kurt Cochran. They told the Daily Mail that he later began drinking and using drugs and slipped into criminal behaviour, receiving convictions for assault and possession of offensive weapons between 1983 and 2003. According to The Sun tabloid, he married a Muslim woman in 2004 and moved the following year to Saudi Arabia to teach English, returning in 2009, but officials could not confirm this. A total of 11 people have been arrested over the attack, their ages ranging from 21 to 58, all on suspicion of preparation of terrorist attacks. All four women have since been released, one on bail, while five of the men were also released, according to police. Lawmakers returned to work as normal on Thursday morning, even as forensic officers worked at the scene, but a review of parliamentary security is now under way. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, whose attempts to save police officer Palmer were widely praised, was on Friday appointed to the Privy Council, a prestigious role usually reserved for senior ministers, as a reward for his efforts. The attack had echoes of the atrocities in Nice and Berlin when trucks ploughed into crowds of people, killing 86 people in the French Riviera city in July and 12 at a market in the German capital just days before Christmas.

Author: Carlton Reid Publish date: Mar 23, 2017 Lord Carlile has told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that yesterday's terrorist attack in London was, in effect, made easier by a paint-only cycle lane on Westminister Bridge. Lord Carlile is a crossbench peer and, from 2001 to 2011, he was the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. The attacker then abandoned his car and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer, a policeman guarding the Houses of Parliament. The parliamentary estate is ringed by public highways, including roads, footways and a small length of kerb-protected cycleway. However, the cycle lane on Westminster Bridge is protected by paint alone, although work is soon to start on adding kerbs to the cycle lane. The interview can be heard on the Today programme's website at 53 minutes 30 seconds. Later in the programme a presenter asked London Mayor Sadiq Khan about easy access to the cycle lane, but Khan did not respond to that point. The spot where the British-born attacker abandoned the 4x4 is just beyond the bridge and where the protected cycleway starts. Some MPs and peers blame London's cycleways for, among other things, congestion and air pollution. In 2015, Lord Lawson claimed that cycleways were more damaging to London than anything since the Blitz. All rights reserved. England and Wales company registration number 2008885."}

Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Big Ben lit up honoring London attack victims 00:46 Jonathan Russell is head of policy at Quilliam, a counter-extremism think tank in London. Joshua Stewart is a strategic communications officer there. The opinions in this article belong to the authors. (CNN)Wednesday's attack on London was expected, planned for, and in the view of many, a long time coming. This was amply reflected in the way in which London, its security services and the public responded: rapid first responders, clear public information dissemination and a narrative of resistance. In many ways, we could not have hoped for a more effective response -- from both the police and members of the public. Read More Equally, the elasticity with which the police were able to absorb the shock of attack, contain the threat and then coordinate simultaneous raids across the country on known suspects -- without causing substantial fear or disruption to public life -- is remarkable. Despite this, there is, of course, room for us to assess the current security and intelligence picture; evaluate our strengths, limitations and what we can learn from this. At this stage, it is hard to say whether this was deliberate. If so, then it is extremely likely that other would-be attackers will be doing exactly the same thing. Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Digital and signals intelligence can only go so far. To carry out human surveillance on just one target requires several human officers. In short, prioritization is essential. Terrorists always look for the path of least resistance. This is why they fill post-conflict vacuums. But it is also why we have seen a proliferation of unsophisticated attacks in Europe. Trucks in Nice, France, and Berlin, cars and knives in London. Security services simply cannot prevent these in all cases. However tempting it is, we should avoid hinging our response around hard security measures. Counterintuitively, our best way of responding is to innovate and enhance our soft power and preventative approaches, so that would-be lone actors become less likely to slip through the net of society. Counter-extremism initiatives fill this gap. If extremist recruiters seek to manipulate grievances, teachers and youth workers must develop programs to address them through promoting democratic responses. As radicalizers identify the vulnerable experiencing identity crises and promote a ready-made group identity as a quick fix, we must proactively show them alternative pathways, preventing these people from becoming radicalized. Because ISIS promotes its fantasies so effectively online, we must enlist communications firms and social media experts to counter such narratives -- and moderate imams to challenge their pernicious Islamist ideology while also distinguishing it from Islam. It is incumbent on all parts of civil society to support this common cause to prevent terrorism. First responders and the security services do a wonderful job, but there are simply some things they cannot do alone. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. .d8888b."}

Objections from the US and France sank the idea. Cameron, though no neocon, is a traditional Atlanticist, and has energetically promoted a small fraternity of foreign policy hawks since gaining the Tory leadership in 2005. They first emerged in defence of Tony Blair and his unpopular foreign policies. Cameron himself, though he only reluctantly voted for the Iraq war, greatly admired Blair's stance in the debacle. Indeed, for many Tories , Blair is neocon rex. Gove is the author of a number of neoconservative tracts. In it, Gove was trying to persuade Tory allies sceptical of the adventurism of Rumsfeld and Bush that their policies were ones that the great patriarchs of conservatism would approve of. Palmerston and Churchill were also given their due as precursors to modern neoconservatism. Alongside Gove in the neoconservative faction are Ed Vaizey, the under-secretary of state who is, like Gove, has also signed up to the Henry Jackson Society's principles. His PPS, Greg Hands MP, is also a signatory to the Henry Jackson Society. Neoconservative ideas are also propagated in a number of thinktanks such as Policy Exchange whose director, Nicholas Boles MP, is another Henry Jackson Society signatory. The magazine Standpoint provides monthly ballast to this tendency. This gave the Tories few opportunities to land any damaging blows against New Labour. Cameron's recent speech announcing the failure of multiculturalism can be seen as a tilt toward the neoconservatives in his cabinet. Yet the neoconservative temptation is a dangerous one for Cameron to succumb to. It offers moral and intellectual definition to an aggressive but vacillating government lacking legitimacy. But Cameron still needs his Liberal allies, and the electoral base for neoconservatism is smaller even than for the aggressive Thatcherism he jettisoned in opposition. If Cameron were to openly embrace the neoconservative agenda, it would be a retreat from the electoral coalition-building that has temporarily saved the Tories from irrelevance.

One video showed photos of men firing assault rifles and fighters on horseback holding Daesh flags while leading a procession of vehicles. An eighth video, the only one not made by Staples, featured the logo of a media organisation used by Daesh to release propaganda material. Staples uploaded the video to his YouTube account. In the video an armed man wearing camouflage says that the only path to victory is through sacrifice and jihad. Staples posted the videos between May and September 2016 and had more than 1,000 followers on the accounts. The CPS argued that each video glorified violent jihad and his intention was to encourage others to fight for Daesh. On 24 January he was found not guilty of one count of encouraging terrorism. When questioned by police, Staples denied having extremist or political views; he said the videos were only pictures with no political purpose. During the trial, he gave evidence that he had created one of the videos but claimed that two men he had limited details for had visited his house and must have created the remaining videos without his knowledge. The court heard that in January 2016 he had been convicted of child cruelty after showing a young child a video of jihadist beheadings.

She says, feebly. I was never at risk at all. I was on the other side of the river to where the innocent people were murdered. However, I was scared, frightened, in shock. I want to scream, burst into tears, hit something. Outside, the sickening sound of ambulances and police cars builds up. Feeling rather morbid I watch, not knowing what else to do. It will take several hours for me to calm down. Everyone is in shock. This is incredibly unlikely, I say to myself, repeatedly. You are fine. My friends are also behaving weirdly in their shock. They go from silent horror, to attempts at humour, to almost excitement. Some want us to come back from university early. Hours after the attack, the tension is palpable. People being murdered in cold blood is scary. Especially when it happens so close to home. Terrorists know that. Go out tomorrow and walk the streets, attend that party and go and watch that film.

While ambulances and other emergency vehicles dominated scenes, Mr Robinson shouted aggressively at those who challenged him and launched into a scathing analysis of the incident for his personal camera crew. The reality is these people are waging war on us. But Mr Robinson has been denounced for his intervention, with people accusing him of simply inflaming the situation and exploiting the tragedy for his own gain. A video of the far-right leader, who led the EDL from 2009 until October 2013, outside the Houses of Parliament appeared on Rebel Media, a fringe right-wing Canadian media company after he went down to the scene. Mr Robinson announced he was leaving the EDL in 2013 in a joint conference with think tank Quilliam. His departure was widely covered, with the former leader later telling police he would help with their investigations into alleged racists within the extremist group. Proceedings at Parliament were suspended on Wednesday afternoon after a police officer was stabbed and an alleged assailant shot by armed police outside the Houses of Parliament, shortly after a vehicle is reported to have mowed into members of the public on Westminster Bridge. Police are treating the Westminster shooting which took place on Wednesday afternoon as a terrorist incident until further notice."}

The latest arrest was a 30-year-old man who was detained in the central city of Birmingham on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts, London's Metropolitan Police said. A dozen people have been arrested since Wednesday's attack by 52-year-old Khalid Masood who deliberately ran down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge then stabbed a policeman just inside the gates of parliament. Nine people have been released without charge, while a 58-year-old man remains in custody and a 32-year-old woman has been released on bail. The arrest came as the government confirmed Masood had used the WhatsApp messaging service, saying it was crucial that the security services be allowed to access the heavily-encrypted app. Media reports said Masood used the Facebook-owned service just minutes before staging his assault, although it was unclear whether he sent any messages or just looked at the app. Although police believe he acted alone on the day, investigators are still trying to find out whether he was encouraged or directed by others. Tech firms and social media players are coming under increasing pressure over extremists using their websites, applications and technology to communicate extremist content. Last year, US authorities fought a legal battle with tech giant Apple to get it to unlock a smartphone used by one of the shooters in a 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California. The FBI's own experts ended up breaking into the device. And Google has faced a boycott by companies whose adverts appear alongside extremist content on its internet platforms, particularly its video-sharing site YouTube."}

Another group of men sitting nearby, aged between 18 and 26, laughed and made comments. Goh, who had been dating Darren since they were 15, said she pleaded with him not to get involved. The beating lasted for 15 minutes, during which time Darren managed to call his friend on his mobile. By the time the friend got there half an hour later, Darren had already been taken to hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival from neck and head injuries. His two friends and Goh were unhurt. 11 men were arrested. Darren, who had a step sister, returned home from Sheffield three weeks ago.

Get short URL Topic: Westminster Attack (50) 4 10 5 The terror attacks that have occurred in France, Germany and Britain in the past twelve months indicate that the special services of EU countries are losing the fight against terrorism, Sergey Goncharov, head of the Alpha Anti-Terrorist Unit's International Association of Veterans, told Sputnik. On Wednesday, four people were killed and many others injured after a vehicle drove into a crowd on London's Westminster Bridge near the UK Parliament building. The terrorist was later shot by police after he stabbed an officer inside the Parliament compound. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that a British-born man inspired by Islamist ideology, who had been previously investigated by MI-5, was responsible for the attack. On July 14, 2016, a truck rammed into a large crowd that was celebrating Bastille Day in Nice. At least 86 people, including children, were killed and over 400 people were injured. The driver was shot dead by police. Daesh claimed responsibility for the attack. On December 19, Anis Amri, a 24-year-old asylum seeker from Tunisia, drove a heavy truck into a crowd at the Christmas market on the Breitscheidplatz square in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring almost 50 others. A few days later, Amri was shot by police in Milan, Italy. He stressed that it is almost impossible to fight lone-wolf terrorists. At the same time, Goncharov said that he does not see the fact that the unarmed policeman was the first to stand in the way of the terrorist in London as an indication of a security breach.

The dead officer was named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father. The attacker has not been named. Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said they think they know who he is and that he was inspired by international and Islamist-related terrorism, but gave no further details. The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament. The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed. The attacker was shot dead by armed officers. The pair had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer became a policeman. Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood - a former Army officer whose brother died in the Bali terrorist bombing in 2002 - attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of PC Palmer. The attacker's other victims have not been named yet. One is known to be a woman. She is expected to make a statement in the Commons later. BBC Newsnight reported there was a suggestion the car used in the attack was hired from an address in Birmingham. However, this has not been confirmed. Armed police carried out a raid on an address in Hagley Road in the city on Wednesday night. The BBC understands the Birmingham raid is linked to the London attack. West Midlands Police referred inquires about the operation to Scotland Yard. Analysis Image copyright PA Image caption A man believed to be the suspect received medical treatment, while two knives lie on the ground By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent The carnage on Westminster Bridge and inside the grounds of Parliament is the attack that security chiefs here in the UK have long been preparing for. Terrorism looks not just to kill and maim - but to create panic and such a sense of disorder that it rocks a city or nation to its foundations. And this attacker sought to do so in as low-tech way as is possible. The days when terrorism meant large, complex bombs and months of planning are gone: Western security agencies - particularly MI5 and its partner agencies - are very, very good at identifying those plots and disrupting them. The longer it takes to plan such an attack, the more people who are involved, the more chances there will be for security services to learn what is going on.

Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. This was a long time ago. Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. I didn't know his name before. It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

A Met Police spokesman claimed that no explosion has taken place on Birdcage Walk, near where mourners have gathered for a vigil in Trafalgar Square. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline that officers had been called after a suspect package was found in Birdcage Walk, close to Buckingham Palace. The road runs from the landmark, down past the Palace of Westminster, and turns into the A302, which goes over Westminster Bridge. Four people were killed when the attacker mowed down pedestrians and cyclists on the bridge then stabbed an officer by the gates of the Houses of Parliament. Two civilians injured on the bridge died, as well as the policeman and Masmood, who was shot by another officer moments after stabbing his colleague. Not sure what happened though. Sky News producer Pia Talbot claimed that police told them they had carried out a controlled explosion within earshot of their crew. The spokesman said police would not be releasing further information. More to follow. account.

Updated at 7.26am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 7.22am EDT 07:22 Theresa May's statement - Summary MPs from all sides of the Commons have been praising Theresa May for the tone and the language she used in her statement to the Commons about the Westminster terror attack. It is routine for prime ministers to respond to terrorist killings by saying that democracy will prevail, but May delivered that message this morning with great dignity and sincerity. Here are the key points. But he had not been a current suspect, she said. His identity is known to the police and MI5, and when operational considerations allow, he will be publicly identified. He was a peripheral figure. She gave details of the nationalities of those injured on Westminster Bridge. Two people were killed and about 40 more were injured, she said: In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know that the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in. A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price. A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us. Owen Lambert, 18, was on Westminster Bridge when the vehicle ploughed into pedestrians, killing two and leaving dozens more injured. His fellow student, Travis Frain, suffered a cracked rib plus hand and arm injuries. He is expected to remain in hospital for several days. Police officers like Keith Palmer put their lives on the line every day, she said. They show enormous bravery and we are grateful to them all. Photograph: PA What happened yesterday was an appalling atrocity. Today, we are united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity. The injured include people of ten nationalities. Innocent people were killed yesterday walking across Westminster Bridge as many millions of Londoners and tourists have done before them. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. It behoves us all not to rush to judgement, but to wait for the police to establish the facts. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred. Updated at 7.13am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 7.06am EDT 07:06 Attacker's car was rented from Enterprise in Birmingham area The attacker rented a car from an Enterprise branch within the Birmingham city area, sources have told the Guardian. We ran another check to verify, and immediately contacted the authorities. Updated at 7.08am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 7.05am EDT 07:05 Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader, praised the prime minister for her statement. Today of all days we are reminded that, notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues, we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none. In the days to come I hope we will remember the love and bravery of the victim, not just the hatred and cowardice of the attackers. Others paying tribute in the house include the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Since June 2013 our police, security and intelligence agencies have successfully disrupted 13 separate terrorist plots in Britain. Mr Speaker, in terms of security here in Westminster, we should be clear first of all that an attacker attempted to break into Parliament and was shot dead within twenty yards of the gates. If his intention was to gain access to this building, we should be clear that he did not succeed.The police heroically did their job. But as is routine, the police together with the House authorities are reviewing the security of the Parliamentary estate, co-ordinated with the Cabinet Office, who have responsibility for the security measures in place around the Government secure zone. All of us in this House have a responsibility for the security and safety of our staff and advice is available for Members who need it. Mr Speaker, yesterday we saw the worst of humanity, but we will remember the best. We will remember the extraordinary efforts to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, including those by my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Bournemouth East. And we will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way ... Mr Speaker, a lot has been said since terror struck London yesterday. Much more will be said in the coming days. But the greatest response lies not in the words of politicians, but in the everyday actions of ordinary people. The streets are as busy as ever. The offices full. The coffee shops and cafes bustling. As I speak millions will be boarding trains and aeroplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth. A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in. A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price. A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us. Mr Speaker, let this be the message from this House and this nation today: our values will prevail. And I commend this statement to the House. Theresa May speaking in parliament. Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy. But today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face ofterrorism. And we meet here in the oldest of all parliaments because we know democracy and the values it entails will always prevail. Those values free speech, liberty, human rights and rule of law are embodied here in this place and shared by free people around the world. A terrorist came to the place where people of all nationalities and culture gather to celebrate what it means to be free. He took out his rage indiscriminately on men, women and children. This was an attack on free people everywhere and on behalf of the British people I would like to thank our friends and allies around the world who have made it clear they stand with us. What happened on the streets of Westminster sickened us all. While there is an ongoing police investigation, the House will understand there are limits to what I can say but having been updated by police and security officials let me set out what at this stage I can tell the house. At approximately 2.40pm yesterday a single attacker drove his vehicle at speed into innocent pedestrians crossing Westminster Bridge, killing two people and injuring around 40 more. In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. We are in close contacts with the governments of the countries of all those affected. The injured also included three police officers returning from an event to recognise their bravery ... Two of those three remain in a serious condition. The attacker then left the vehicle and approached a police officer at Carriage Gates, attacking that officer with a large knife before he was shot dead by an armed police officer. Tragically 48 year old PC Keith Palmer was killed. He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten. I can confirm police have searched six addresses and made eight arrests in Birmingham and London. It is still believed this attacker acted alone and police have no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public. His identity is known to the police and MI5. When operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. What I can confirm is the man was British born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He is not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or the plot. We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real. But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not and will not be cowed by this threat. We are stepping up policing to reassure the public and as a precautionary measure it will mean increasing patrols in cities across the country, with more police and more armed police on the streets. Updated at 7.01am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 6.49am EDT 06:49 Corbyn says the injured include people from 10 nationalities. We send them our best wishes, he says. He urges people to look after each other, to help one another and think of one another. It is by looking after each other that we will defeat the poison and hatred. All rights reserved."}

Home of the Daily and Sunday Express. The funeral service was led by the Dean of Southwark The Very Reverend Andrew Nunn and is being followed by a private cremation. The Met's senior chaplain, the Reverend Prebendary Jonathan Osborne, led the prayers and Chief Insp Neil Sawyer, who worked with PC Palmer in Bromley and the Territorial Support Group, paid warm tribute to his colleague. Hymns including I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say were followed by a rendition of The Last Post by a bugler from the Honourable Artillery Company. Officers bowed their heads as the Last Post sounded from the cathedral shortly after a recital of the Lord's Prayer. A few moments' silence then followed a rendition of God Save The Queen, as on-duty officers, medical staff and members of the public stood still in respect for PC Palmer. Around 50 members of PC Palmer's family including his wife, child, mother and father, brother and sisters are attended the service. PC Palmer's coffin travelled 2.6 miles along some of the capital's usually bustling streets - but avoiding the scene of last month's atrocity on Westminster Bridge - to arrive for the 2pm ceremony. Met commissioner Cressida Dick - the first female head of Scotland Yard in its 188-year history - also attended the funeral. It was her first public engagement in her new role. The officer's name has been added to the police roll of honour at the National Police Memorial in London. GETTY Floral tributes blanket the street near the site where the PC died Yesterday, the officer's coffin was draped in the flag of the Metropolitan Police as it was taken to a chapel just a short distance from where he died. PC Palmer, 48, rested at St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster for 24 hours ahead of his funeral today. PC Palmer, a father of a five year-old daughter, was murdered by Khalid Masood after the he killed four pedestrians on Westminster Bridge on March 22. Four other people were innocently killed and dozens of others injured in the 82-second attack on Wednesday March 22, which ended with lone-wolf attacker Khalid Masood being shot dead.

On the day of the attack on March 22, Pc Palmer, a husband and father, was on duty at the Palace of Westminster. The 48-year-old officer came face to face with Masood, who was armed with two large knives, moments after the terrorist drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Intent on protecting his colleagues and the public, Pc Palmer confronted the 52-year-old attacker despite the danger he faced. Video: How the Westminster attack unfolded The policeman was fatally wounded during the incident, which came to a close when Masood was shot dead by armed officers. Pc Palmer had served on the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Group since 2016 and had been with the Met for 16 years. It is not the first honour for Pc Palmer, as last year it was announced that he was to be awarded a George Medal in the Queen's civilian gallantry list. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood was also honoured at the ceremony, being given an outstanding contribution award for his efforts in rushing to help Pc Palmer. Mr Ellwood, a former soldier, tried in vain to save the officer, giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and applying pressure to staunch the flow of blood from his wounds.

Japan stands in solidarity with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, as well as with its people during this difficult time. Prime Minister May has conveyed the message that the United Kingdom is firm in the fight against terrorism. Japan offers its full support to Prime Minister May and will combat terrorism in cooperation with the international community. In December, a man whose asylum claim had been rejected by Germany drove a truck into a market in Berlin, killing 12. Last July a stolen truck driven through a Bastille Day parade in Nice killed 86. The strikes appear inspired, if not actively commissioned, by Isis in Iraq and Syria. In November a student used a vehicle and knives to injure 13 on a campus in Ohio, in the US. His motives and allegiance are less clear. Such attacks are not unprecedented, but have become much more numerous in recent years. Though al-Adnani, who was killed in 2016, pointed a finger specifically at France, where there were two vehicle attacks in 2014, he also cited the UK among preferred targets.

The Guardian has not been able to verify this report. Facebook Twitter Google plus 11.54pm EDT 23:54 Elle Hunt Londoners have expressed defiance after the terrorist attack at Westminster, sharing messages of solidarity on social media. At this point it is not clear whether this is in any way related to the attack in London. She is originally from Germany but now lives in South Australia. Turnbull said: As prime minister Theresa May said earlier this morning, the values of the British parliament command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. And so they do because they are our values too. We stand, all of us, with the UK. Comforted that we share those values. Freedom of speech, democracy, the rule of law. We will never give in to terror. He said of British MP Tobias Ellwood, who assisted attempts to resuscitate the police officer, PC Keith Palmer, who was fatally stabbed: This act of heroism is just one of the extraordinary stories that are emerging from this tragedy. Shorten paid tribute to Palmer: The murder of the Metropolitan police officer reminds us of the risks our security agencies take on our behalf to keep us safe. And on behalf of all honourable members I want to acknowledge and thank our Australian federal police and the parliamentary security officers for whom this news must strike a particular chord. Consular staff in London are offering the woman assistance, he said. He added: We stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says the injured person lives in South Australia. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace. There will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates, but for now, there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job.

The attacker shot dead by police on the Champs-Elysees on Thursday evening is believed to be Karim Cheurfi, 39. A property being searched in the eastern Paris suburb of Chelles is understood to be his home and three members of his family have been taken into custody. Anti-terrorism prosecutor Francois Molins said that a note had apparently fallen out of Cheurfi's pocket that defended the Islamic State. Mr Molins said Cheurfi had a long criminal record, including trying to attack police previously. He added that Cheurfi had been arrested in February but released due to lack of evidence. French officials, speaking anonymously, said the suspect had been convicted of attempted murder after firing on two plainclothes police in 2001. While in jail, he also shot and wounded a prison officer after grabbing his gun. He was one of the officers who responded to the attack on the Bataclan during the Paris attacks in November 2015. As the country prepares to vote, France's prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said more than 50,000 police and gendarmes, as well as 7,000 soldiers, had been mobilised to safeguard the election and protect polling stations. 1:48 Video: Family say they were 10ft from the gunman Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen used the aftermath of the attack to call for the government to immediately expel foreigners being monitored by intelligence services and to reinstate France's borders. Image: The public were ushered away from the scene as police drew their weapons :: Charlie Hebdo to Champs-Elysees - timeline of France terror attacks The attack happened when a silver Audi pulled up next to a police van on the famous Champs-Elysees avenue - usually packed with tourists heading to the Arc de Triomphe. The gunman got out and immediately used an assault rifle to shoot officers guarding an area near the Franklin Roosevelt metro station. He tried to run along the pavement, aiming at other police and hitting two of them. Other officers opened fire, killing the assailant. 1:08 Video: Paris attack witness: 'I heard six gunshots' As well as the two officers - who doctors now say are out of danger - a female German tourist was also wounded. A pump-action shotgun and knives were found in the gunman's car. IS claimed it was responsible for the attack and named Abu Yusuf al Beljiki as the attacker. The pseudonym indicates the attacker was Belgian - something the country's interior minister, Jan Jambon, has denied, insisting the attacker was French. In fact, he (the gunman) was hidden behind the van and shooting at the police. He said he and tourists fled to a shop. Image: The car believed to have been used in the attack Police were seen pointing their weapons at members of public as they evacuated the area. The people of France will not take much more of this.

At least two people have died as a result of being injured by the car. The driver then reportedly ran the few metres to the parliament complex and attacked a police officer with a knife before being shot by another officer. The police later confirmed that the stabbed officer was among the dead, as well as the suspected attacker. Parliamentarians were quickly put into lockdown and the prime minister was driven away at speed. The rapidity with which the authorities reacted proves that London, though horrified by what has happened, was ready for such an event. MPs were kept shut in the House of Commons as the incident unfolded outside. PA Senior security figures including Andrew Parker, head of intelligence agency MI5, have been warning of the potential for an attack of this kind for some time. The devastation that can be caused when ordinary vehicles are used as weapons on soft targets such as civilian areas has been all too clear in recent years. With so many killed in Nice in July 2016 and Berlin in December 2016 by men driving lorries into crowds, there has been mounting concern about how to protect public spaces. On this occasion it appeared to be a car that was used, but the driver was still able to inflict serious injury on passers by. The terror effect The Metropolitan Police have been preparing for such an incident in London at least since Daesh (IS) struck in Paris in November 2015. And planning has realistically been in the works since long before that. London suffered its last large-scale terrorist attack in 2005, but several smaller scale incidents have occurred since and many more plots foiled. Preparations for attacks have included a series of exercises to test responses and effectiveness in dealing with an incident. Just days before the Westminster attack, armed police were out on the river Thames carrying out a large-scale hostage simulation involving a ferry and dozens of actors. Police lock down the area around parliament. Government minister Tobias Ellwood attempted to resuscitate the stabbed policeman. These days, physical barriers can be seen at strategic locations all over London. The palace of Westminster itself is surrounded by large black barriers, which make approaching the complex in a vehicle difficult. Police officers are deployed at strategic locations and their numbers have been increased lately. They are on the ground to provide a rapid response to attack and appear to have done exactly that in this case. The suspect was tackled extremely quickly and the area locked down at great speed. Details are still emerging but most are in agreement that the police reaction was rapid and worthy of high praise.

For the murder and mayhem unleashed in Westminster and the life of McGuinness were two aspects of a timeless story. They were a reminder of the pain terror inflicts, and the precious fragility of any and every effort to make it stop. The murder and mayhem unleased in Westminster and the life of McGuinness were two aspects of a timeless story Start with the pain, which is never a surprise but strikes afresh with each new outrage. Consider the arbitrariness that can end the life of a man from faraway Utah, in London to celebrate his silver wedding, or a college worker collecting her kids from school or a retired window cleaner off to a visit a friend in hospital. The sense of duty that propels an unarmed policeman towards an attacker carrying a knife. And meanwhile, over in Derry, images from a church, images that would once have made no sense, at least not under a single roof. There was the coffin, draped in the tricolour of Ireland, containing the body of the former IRA commander in the city. Just a few steps away stood the current leader of the Democratic Unionist party, the successor to the Rev Ian Paisley. The DUP leader was there to pay her respects to the former IRA man. Anyone old enough to remember life on these islands before the 1990s can only feel astonishment at such a sight. These were once mortal enemies, with an emphasis on the mortal. In the 1970s, every year but one saw the number of British deaths caused by terrorism top the 100 mark: in 1972, the figure reached 353. In the 80s and early 90s, the annual death toll hovered between 50 and 100. And almost all of those deaths were in Northern Ireland. Strange to recall it now, but the persistence of this lethal conflict became part of the mental furniture: there, but not something you thought about too often. A bombing or shooting in Belfast was a routine news story. Bomb scares at London railway stations or shops were regular occurrences, an inconvenience to be got around. His reputation was for clear-eyed, unflinching brutality. But McGuinness then applied that same single-minded, disciplined focus to the task of peacemaking. He was a patient, creative negotiator, who deserves much credit for the Good Friday agreement. He was a core part of both the problem and the solution. His record of violence was not erased by the shift he made, but our view of it is inevitably altered. In 2002, I found myself in the chair at a two-day private meeting, organised by the Guardian, which brought those who had forged the Good Friday agreement face to face with Israeli and Palestinian leaders longing to resolve their own conflict. The most memorable session came when McGuinness sat alongside the loyalist leader David Ervine. The latter explained that each of them had once been hellbent on killing the other. Now they were determined that their children would grow up with better dreams. They held the room rapt. Much as we might wish it were otherwise, their words had a greater impact than those spoken by the Ulster Unionist or SDLP leaders who had always eschewed violence. The explanation was partly practical: the Israelis and Palestinians around the table knew that no peace between their peoples would ever hold unless it included the men of violence. But something more human was at work too: the sense that, because the likes of Ervine and McGuinness had seen into, even fallen into, the abyss, their determination to pull back from it was especially intense. And, as Bill Clinton captured in a masterful eulogy to McGuinness, we cannot help but be inspired by stories of men who abandon war to pursue peace. It gives us hope. When you have one, you hold it carefully and with both hands. Yet this basic wisdom seems lost on our current leaders. True, the common travel area between north and south exists independent of the EU, and should survive. Recall that the arch-Brexiteer Michael Gove was a noisy, inconsolable foe of the peacemakers of Northern Ireland. He authored a denunciation of the Good Friday agreement in 2000, two years after it had been signed. No wonder, then, that Gove and his fellow members of what is still, misleadingly, called the Conservative and Unionist party are ready to yank out a plank from an infinitely complex, frail structure assembled with such patience two decades ago. Like the rest of us, they have seen again this week the pain that terrorism can cause. In the onward march to Brexit, there is nothing that gives them pause.

For the attack in June 2017 in London, see 2017 London Bridge attack. For the incident in 2018, see 2018 Westminster car crash. For other uses, see Westminster attack. The attacker, 52-year-old Briton Khalid Masood, drove a car into pedestrians on the pavement along the south side of Westminster Bridge and Bridge Street, injuring more than 50 people, five of them fatally. He then crashed the car into the perimeter fence of the Palace grounds and ran into New Palace Yard, where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer. He was then shot by an armed police officer and died at the scene. Masood reportedly said in a final text message that he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries in the Middle East. Amaq News Agency, which is linked to Islamic State, said the attacker answered the group's calls to target citizens of states that are fighting against it, though the claim was questioned by the UK police and government. One of the victims, a Romanian tourist, was thrown by the car's impact over the parapet of the bridge into the River Thames below. Masood, wearing black clothes, got out of the car and ran around the corner into Parliament Square and through the open Carriage Gates where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer, PC Keith Palmer. Parliamentary staff were confined to their offices; journalists and visitors to Parliament were not permitted to leave the building. A fifth victim, Andreea Cristea, a 31-year-old tourist from Romania, fell into the Thames during the attack; she died in hospital as a result of her injuries on 6 April after her life support was withdrawn. He changed his name to Khalid Masood after he converted to Islam. Born in Kent, Masood was brought up in Rye, East Sussex, and later attended secondary school in Tunbridge Wells in Kent. In 2000, he was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm after a knife attack in a public house in Northiam in Sussex. Farasat Latif, director of the language school in Luton where Masood taught between 2010 and 2012, told The Guardian that when Masood lived in Luton he was apolitical and not aligned with the younger and predominantly Asian local radical Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun. Masood's profile was atypical in that most jihadi terrorists are under 30, while he was 52. The security services later recovered the last WhatsApp message sent by Masood shortly before his attack. The investigation was named Operation Classific. By 25 March, only one man from Birmingham remained in custody and the woman on bail from East London had been removed from police enquiries. A one-minute silence in honour of the dead was observed in Parliament, and by London's emergency services, at 09:33. That evening, there was a public candlelit vigil in Trafalgar Square to honour victims of the attack. Amber Rudd appeared on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show to call for government backdoor access to encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, which Masood used to send a message shortly before the attack. She announced a meeting with similar technology industry leaders for 30 March, where she would persuade them to voluntarily co-operate with the government. The cameras recorded the involvement of the emergency room and intensive care staff over the next few hours, and then followed the cases of three patients until their discharge. The Independent.

The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. This was a long time ago. Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. I didn't know his name before. It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

Video: Ronan McGreevy Floral tributes in Parliament Square, London, for the victims of the Westminster terror attack. The footage, captured by The London Times, shows the aftermath of the assault on New Palace Yard which left police officer Keith Palmer fatally wounded. Mr Palmer was knifed by the attacker, Khalid Masood, after the terrorist drove a car at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before storming the parliamentary estate armed with two knives. He was then shot dead by police. As armed officers swarm the cobbled forecourt after killing Masood, the footage shows that the iron gate which allows vehicles to enter parliament was apparently left wide open. No police officers are visibly guarding the entry point, known as Carriage Gates, fuelling concern that the attack might have been worse had Masood been followed by accomplices. Pedestrians are shown walking past and at one stage a courier on a moped appears to enter unchallenged. Separate footage had shown British prime minister Theresa May being rushed from the building and into a waiting car just yards away. Former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Ian Blair and ex-House of Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans have both said security will now have to be stepped up. Prison Meanwhile, fears Khalid Masood was groomed for extremism in prison have heightened after it was claimed he turned to Islam while behind bars. Only two men - a 27-year-old and 58-year-old arrested in Birmingham - remain in custody after a hunt for accomplices saw 11 people detained in raids across England. It remains unclear whether the assault was carried out alone or with support. A childhood friend of the man who was known then as Adrian Elms told The Sun newspaper that Masood first emerged as a Muslim after serving a jail sentence. Saudi statement The Saudi embassy said Masood lived in the country between November 2005 and 2006 and between April 2008 and April 2009, during which time he worked as an English teacher on a work visa. He travelled to the country again for five days in March 2015. Masood was born in Kent, but moved across the country and used a variety of aliases, including Adrian Russell Ajao. Searches at three addresses are continuing. He had convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm, as well as possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. Mr Cochran was killed and Ms Cochran was badly injured. Aysha Frade, who worked in administration at independent sixth-form school DLD College London, in Westminster, also died. She is believed to be a 43-year-old mother-of-two. Leslie Rhodes, a retired window cleaner from Clapham, south London, died from injuries sustained in the attack.

Revelations that Khalid Masood used the messaging service WhatsApp just minutes before launching his attack sparked fresh debate over encryption and privacy, with communications providers meeting the Home Secretary on Thursday. He warned that Isis was using social media not only to spread its message, but to incite and control attacks, including a 2015 shooting at an exhibit featuring cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed in Texas. That was linked to British Isis hacker Junaid Hussain, who foreshadowed attack on Twitter after the perpetrators used the social network to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. Police released a picture of him on Friday. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and detained under the Terrorism Act was released on Sunday, Met police said in a statement. Eleven other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have also been released with no further action. The inquest into the death of Khalid Masood was adjourned on Thursday and a pre-inquest review has been set by the coroner for May 19. In all, Khalid Masood killed four people and injured more than 30 others in the March 22 attack before he was shot dead. One other person remains hospitalized in critical condition. Masood's cause of death was revealed Thursday in Westminster coroner's court, the Associated Press reported. Masood, 52, drove a car across Parliament Bridge, injuring scores of people, before crashing the vehicle into railings at the side of the houses of parliament. He then assaulted police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries, before being shot dead by officers on the scene. In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. That understanding may have died with him. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. There was nothing more you could have done. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. Authorities believe he acted alone. The 27-year-old man arrested late on Thursday in Birmingham was told he would face no further action. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London and bailed until the end of this month has also been released with no further action. As well as the six people released from custody last night, a 35-year-old man has been released with no further police action, and a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until the end of the month. Both were arrested in Manchester. Meanwhile, two men remain in custody: a 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham on Thursday morning, and a 28-year-old man arrested later in the day at a separate address in the city. They are being detained under the Terrorism Act 2000. One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. She is due to return to police until a date later this month. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Here's everything we know about him. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Read more about what we know so far here. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Read more about Masood here. The man had been in a hospital, and he was taken off life support. The man, who was not named, was one of two people who suffered life-threatening injuries in the attack. Around 23 people were injured in Wednesday's attack, and several were in critical condition. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Read more here. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Nothing to do with immigration. Read more here. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. Please continue to pray for our family. US president Donald Trump tweeted his condolences. My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. Many of the tributes included messages of condolence for PC Keith Palmer, the 48-year-old officer who died after he was stabbed outside the houses of parliament. Read more here. Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. No act of terror can shake the strength and resilience of our British ally. The very heart of the city has been struck. And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. The embassy said he had suffered a knee injury but has been discharged from hospital and that it is in contact with both their families. Read more here. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. Read more here. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Lords and MPs such as Tory MP Dominic Grieve, pictured here dodging some police tape, carried on regardless on Thursday. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. Read more here. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. Read more here. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. He has now been discharged from hospital. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Read more here. The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. Rowley also added that police understood Muslim communities might feel anxious, given previous actions by extreme right-wing groups following terrorist attacks. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Read more here. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The New York Daily News issued a correction after publishing the wrong name and photo. Investigators are treating it as terrorism, he reiterated, and the city will see an increased presence of armed and unarmed police starting immediately. They said the information was coming from colleagues in London. In fact, the image is from a 2013 incident when a man with a knife was tasered outside Buckingham Palace. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. But I know that the whole country will be thinking and praying for those who are affected, as I am. This is an ongoing incident and the Government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. Values symbolised by the Houses of Parliament. Six males and two females. Care is still ongoing. White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also released a statement in the form of a video on Twitter. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. He was pictured surrounded by medics and police officers giving CPR. Read more here. He said a police officer was among the dead, as well as a man believed to be an attacker. At least 20 people were injured. The number of those injured has not been confirmed. I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks. She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. Eyewitnesses, as well as social media accounts, appear to indicate a number of people were seriously hurt on Westminster Bridge. Earlier, a Reuters photographer, Toby Melville, published pictures of four individuals with injuries on the bridge. The Metropolitan Police Service is dealing with the incident and an urgent investigation is underway. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. I and my staff are safe and currently under lock down. This incident has not been separately confirmed by the Metropolitan police. Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. Emergency services are attempting to revive one individual lying down on the pavement on Parliament Street, some way away from the entrance to the building. Approximately a dozen armed police ran into the building shortly after 3pm."}

Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. This was a long time ago. Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. I didn't know his name before. It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

Others remain in a critical condition as London banded together in a show of support in an emotional candelit vigil at Trafalgar Square last night. Police have searched homes around Birmingham and London in the aftermath of the attack, while maintaining that Masood, who had previously been investigated by MI5 and was known by a number of aliases, had acted alone. Fears have grown that the lone wolf was radicalised while working in Saudi Arabia. Three other officers were injured - PC Kris Aves, who sustained life changing injuries, PC Roger Smith and PC Bradley Bryant. There have now been calls for hero cop Keith Palmer to be awarded a posthumous medal to honour his bravery. The last photograph to emerge of the brave serviceman has since emerged, with a tourist having taken a happy snap with him just 45 minutes before chaos broke out.

Theresa May yesterday admitted there was no prior intelligence of the deadly attack at Parliament, which has now been claimed by ISIS. His mother was questioned by cops but maintained that she was too upset and couldn't comment on the horrific incident. The 52-year-old had been holed-up in a budget hotel near Brighton ahead of Wednesday's carnage.

Business. By Lorelei Marfil on April 5, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge (in Missoni) and Prince Harry arrive after laying a wreath at Westminster Abbey in London. The incident, which took place outside the Palace of Westminster, and on the nearby bridge, saw five people killed, including the perpetrator, and 50 injured. The Westminster Underground station remained shut that day, and government buildings were in lock down as police dealt with the victims on Westminster bridge, and outside the Houses of Parliament. Victims and their families, alongside the police, NHS hospital workers, fire brigade and ambulance teams took part in the service. About 2,000 people attended the multifaith ceremony, called Service of Hope, which was aired on BBC One TV. Kate Middleton wore a gray and white Missoni coat, the same one she donned for the Somme Vigil in France last year. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge (in Missoni) after laying a wreath at Westminster Abbey in London. The attacker, Khalid Masood, was shot and killed by police. Two male suspects were taken into custody that evening, while seven were released by police. A woman was arrested in Manchester, then released on bail, while another woman was arrested in east London, and also released on bail. The attack started when Masood drove his car over Westminster Bridge, hitting and injuring a number of members of the public, also including three police officers who were on their way back from a commendation ceremony. After the car crashed into railings, Masood continued his rampage and tried to enter Parliament, killing a police officer with a knife. Police believe he acted alone. Produced by David Merrick and directed by Gower Champion, the West End play originally debuted on Broadway in 1980. In 1984, it debuted at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane and starred Catherine Zeta Jones. The production raised funds for the Nook Appeal, an initiative under EACH, where the duchess is a patron.

This strike at parliament took aim directly at the heart of British democracy. The earlier car attack on the dozens of tourists and office workers and three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony, caught walking across Westminster Bridge around 2.45pm, was plainly intended to magnify the terror. This is the moment that everyone planned for and hoped would never happen, the Metropolitan police acting deputy commissioner, Mark Rowley, said at his first news conference afterwards. It was also the hardest kind of attack to stop, an apparently lone terrorist using low-tech weaponry seeking to do maximum harm, almost certain of death himself. He got through, but a dozen or more attacks have been foiled in Britain since 2013, 10 of them in the past two years. More than 500 live counter-terror investigations are under way at any given moment, Mr Rowley said recently. The police and the security forces have to be right all the time. The terrorists only need to be lucky once. It is important to hold on to that truth, and to remember that, terrible as the loss of life has been and grim as the aftermath will be, no one would want to live in the kind of world where such an attack had been made entirely impossible. The security forces acted swiftly and courageously to protect parliament and the public. For the families of the dead, and for the injured, this is a horrendous, life-changing event. The shock and distress of eyewitnesses, trapped on buses or simply walking along the pavement, was evident in their voices and their faces as they spoke to reporters. Some of them behaved with impressive presence of mind, including the foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood, who tried to revive the fatally injured policeman. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace. There will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates, but for now, there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job. We often mock our political class, but it is worth remembering that being an MP has never been risk-free. An MP died in the Brighton bomb in 1984, and another was murdered at his home in 1990. Last June, Jo Cox died at the hands of a rightwing extremist, Thomas Mair, as she made her way to her constituency surgery. Security at parliament is tighter than it has ever been. Its one obvious weakness was the main vehicle entrance into New Palace Yard, off the road linking Whitehall with other government offices. This is the very heart of government. It is not an act of war. It must not be allowed to divide us one from the other. The first protection against it must be solidarity. All rights reserved."}

Blind. Deaf. Mmm. There was, however, a desperate urge to get booked on Fox News. And since this is a showbusiness column, may I congratulate Katie and her publicist in pulling the gig off this time. Katie seems marginally more frantic to break America than even Robbie Williams once was. The problem is that Over There hardly lacks for its own supply of reactionary wingnuts. And with a protectionist president openly demanding a return to American-made goods and services, a foreign purveyor of discord will only be first choice in rare situations. Katie knows there are only going to be a few times a news producer is going to call her instead of Ann Coulter. The Westminster attack is one of them. These are the hours and days you need to make count. She wants that phone ringing off the hook. She wants to graduate from Tucker Carlson to helping Sean Hannity talk about anything but Trump and the FBI. To read Katie Hopkins is to know that she would have disagreed with the Enlightenment if she thought there was a Loose Women appearance in it. Her Westminster article reads like a series of Google calendar reminders to herself. An Asian man rushed to hospital. And I grew colder. Prose of lead. The concrete shoe of no verbs. Too many. Staccato sentences. Passing for gravitas. In fact, having performed a highly scientific linguistic analysis, I can confirm Katie uses fewer active verbs than even Tony Blair or John Keats. Still, were Katie on hand now, I expect she would retort that what we say is more important than how we say it. For now, it falls to her to explain London to the Americans. Had Katie spent more than 10 minutes in the World History aisle of Wikipedia, she would know there have always been people who hated cities for what they stood for. The metropolis has at many times served as shorthand for a kind of moral decay and wicked permissiveness that requires (usually forcible) regression. The Khmer Rouge decided that the only solution was to empty the cities, and send their suspiciously educated denizens to the countryside. Yes, in a sledgehammer irony that will nonetheless have escaped her, Abu Hopkins detests the liberalism of the city. A serial preacher of hate, she speaks of humans as cockroaches, and of non-military matters in terms of struggle and war. She now seeks to demonise London among her faithful, calling for an end to its degenerate values in the most apocalyptic terms she can muster. For all the tragedies and assaults enfolded into its history, London is a city that will never be so defeated as to have the time to explain itself to Katie Hopkins. All rights reserved."}

And that perhaps is going to make some Conservative voters unhappy. Only the Green party offers a bold, positive vision for a different kind of Britain. We will stand up to the politics of hatred and division that is scarring our communities and give people across the country a chance to vote for a better Britain. I have just chaired a meeting of the cabinet, where we agreed that the government should call a general election, to be held on June 8. I want to explain the reasons for that decision, what will happen next and the choice facing the British people when you come to vote in this election. Last summer, after the country voted to leave the European Union, Britain needed certainty, stability and strong leadership, and since I became prime minister the government has delivered precisely that. Despite predictions of immediate financial and economic danger, since the referendum we have seen consumer confidence remain high, record numbers of jobs, and economic growth that has exceeded all expectations. We have also delivered on the mandate that we were handed by the referendum result. Britain is leaving the European Union and there can be no turning back. And as we look to the future, the government has the right plan for negotiating our new relationship with Europe. We want a deep and special partnership between a strong and successful European Union and a United Kingdom that is free to chart its own way in the world. That means we will regain control of our own money, our own laws and our own borders and we will be free to strike trade deals with old friends and new partners all around the world. This is the right approach, and it is in the national interest. But the other political parties oppose it. At this moment of enormous national significance there should be unity here in Westminster, but instead there is division. The country is coming together, but Westminster is not. In recent weeks Labour has threatened to vote against the deal we reach with the European Union. The Liberal Democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standstill. And unelected members of the House of Lords have vowed to fight us every step of the way. They are wrong. They underestimate our determination to get the job done and I am not prepared to let them endanger the security of millions of working people across the country. If we do not hold a general election now their political game-playing will continue, and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election. Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country. So we need a general election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin. I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion. Since I became prime minister I have said that there should be no election until 2020, but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take. And so tomorrow I will move a motion in the House of Commons calling for a general election to be held on the eighth of June. That motion, as set out by the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, will require a two-thirds majority of the House of Commons. This is your moment to show you mean it, to show you are not opposing the government for the sake of it, to show that you do not treat politics as a game. Let us tomorrow vote for an election, let us put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programmes for government and then let the people decide. And the decision facing the country will be all about leadership. It will be a choice between strong and stable leadership in the national interest, with me as your prime minister, or weak and unstable coalition government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, propped up by the Liberal Democrats - who want to reopen the divisions of the referendum - and Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. Every vote for the Conservatives will make it harder for opposition politicians who want to stop me from getting the job done. Every vote for the Conservatives will make me stronger when I negotiate for Britain with the prime ministers, presidents and chancellors of the European Union. Every vote for the Conservatives means we can stick to our plan for a stronger Britain and take the right long-term decisions for a more secure future. It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond. So, tomorrow, let the House of Commons vote for an election, let everybody put forward their proposals for Brexit and their programmes for government, and let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability and continue to give the country the strong and stable leadership it demands. Updated at 7.16am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 6.24am EDT 06:24 Here is Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, on the announcement. This election is your chance to change the direction of our country. If you want to avoid a disastrous hard Brexit. If you want to keep Britain in the single market. If you want a Britain that is open, tolerant and united, this is your chance. Only the Liberal Democrats can prevent a Conservative majority. April 18, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus 6.17am EDT 06:17 Matthew Weaver Here are some of the things Theresa May has said in the past about ruling out an early election. Just before she assumed the role of prime minister she said there would be no early election under her leadership. On 30 June, in the speech that launched her bid, she explicitly ruled it out. Then in her first major interview after taking office, she told the Andrew Marr Show last September that the UK needed a period of stability after the shock Brexit vote. In her Christmas message in 2016, May also strongly hinted that an early election was not on the agenda by calling for unity. Updated at 6.24am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 6.12am EDT 06:12 She challenges the opposition parties to accept an early election. Then let the people decide. And that election will be allow about leadership, she says. May says it is with reluctance that she called an election. But it is with determination that she will fight it. Let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability, she says. She says she will give the country the strong leadership it needs. This is the right approach. But the other parties oppose it, she says. There should be unity in Westminster, she says. But there is not, she says. Labour has threatened to vote against the final deal. The Lib Dems want to grind parliamentary business to a standstill. The SNP opposes what the government is doing. And peers have said they will oppose the government all the way. She says she is not prepared to allow her opponents to jeopardise the Brexit negotiations. If there is not an election now, game-playing will continue. And she says the Brexit talks will conclude as election speculation is intensifying. May says she has only recently come to this conclusion. May says she will move a motion in the Commons tomorrow proposing an election on 8 June. Facebook Twitter Google plus 6.06am EDT 06:06 May is explaining her decision now. She says when she became prime minister the country needed stability. She has delivered that, she says. And she has delivered on the referendum result.

Masood ran over dozens of pedestrians and tourists on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon before crashing his car into parliament, where he managed to stab a police officer before being shot dead. Lawmakers returned to work as normal on Thursday morning, even as forensic officers worked at the scene, but a review of parliamentary security is now underway. Numerous aliases The death toll rose late Thursday after life support was withdrawn from a 75-year-old man injured in the attack, whom police named as Leslie Rhodes from south London. The other victims were 48-year-old policeman Keith Palmer and, on the bridge, a 43-year-old British woman, Aysha Frade, who was on her way to pick up her two daughters, and an American citizen in his 50s, Kurt Cochran. One woman was later released on bail. Rowley gave no details of the new arrests, only to say that they took place in the West Midlands the area of the country that includes Birmingham and the north-west of England. Born in Kent in southeast England, Masood was a British citizen with convictions for assault and possession of offensive weapons dating from 1983 to 2003. According to The Sun tabloid, he married a Muslim woman in 2004 and moved the following year to Saudi Arabia to teach, returning in 2009. Police said he went by numerous aliases, including, reportedly, Adrian Elms, while reports suggest he lived all over England, including in Luton and east London. The crowds at Trafalgar Square late Thursday brought messages of defiance, flags and flowers, and offered their condolences to officers who lost a colleague in the attack. First IS claim of British attack The IS group said it was responsible, according to the Amaq propaganda agency, its first claim of an attack on British soil. The latest attack had echoes of the atrocities in Nice and Berlin when trucks ploughed into crowds of people, killing 86 people in the French Riviera city in July and 12 at a market in the German capital just days before Christmas. In 2013, British soldier Lee Rigby was run down and knifed on a London street to death by two Islamist extremists."}

I will leave that subject for another day. However, I have learned that there are times when it is vital to be observant and vigilant when certain events take place. It is an unbelievably important lesson from history that we never take information that is conveyed to us by the media on blind, face value. An irresponsible observer is one who does not scrutinise all they see and are told. Equally so when we do not ask questions. Please keep this in mind as we are told more about the events in Westminster and we observe the subsequent reactions of those in positions of authority. Today is 322. More accurately, it is March 22nd. 322 is considered a hugely significant number in certain occult and esoteric circles. Although many men of power and wealth have moved through the ranks of Skull and Bones, its most high profile member is undoubtedly George W Bush. March 20th 2017 celebrates the High Feast of Ostara and is also the Spring Equinox - often dedicated to the worship of the Mother Earth Goddess Gaia. The date is also curious for an assassination plot that took in Ancient Rome. The Season of Human Sacrifice will conclude on April 30th 2017 - which is Beltane Eve (often celebrated with bonfires and fertility rites) and considered to be one of the most crucial occult dates in the annual calendar. A few weeks ago, a provisional release date for the film was cited, by certain sources, as April 30th. It is now being stated as May 19th. According to several early sources, the assailant allegedly responsible for the events was shot by police at 2.30pm. A number of witnesses heard 3 shots being fired. For much of the afternoon, the BBC has been airing helicopter footage of the Westminster Bridge cordoned off. From the time on the Big Ben clock face, we can see this footage was filmed at 3.20pm. One directs for the A302, the other for the A3211. These are the only road numbers shown on the road surface of Westminster Bridge in the footage. A minister in the House of Commons announced the events in Westminster to his fellow house members at exactly 3pm. Finally, Westminster is located in W1. W is the 23rd letter of the English alphabet. Maybe this is all coincidental... maybe not. I will leave it for you to decide. If nothing else, please remember always to be mindful and observant - especially right now. The Truth Seeker's Guide. Much food for thought I must say. Thank you for the work you do and share with all of us. I agree that we must all remain very diligent especially in the days we are now living.

Several Worcestershire MPs were held on lockdown inside the Commons as today's horrifying terror incident unfolded. Former Worcester Labour MP Mike Foster was also at Westminster today and was told by armed police to leave the area for his own safety. The attacker mowed down people on Westminster Bridge before smashing his car into railings, running through gates at the front of parliament and stabbing a police officer. He then tried to enter the building, where hundreds of MPs were gathered, but was shot several times by armed police as he approached a second officer at 2.45pm. It left a trail of destruction, with victims strewn across the bridge and up to a dozen gunshots heard by witnesses amid the chaos. Some county MPs, including Mid-Worcestershire's Nigel Huddleston and Wyre Forest MP Mark Garnier, were put on lockdown in the chamber as police dealt with the aftermath outside. The staff of all six Worcestershire MP's also locked themselves in their offices as police scrambled to close off roads, before the palaces were evacuated. The dead police officer was named as Keith Palmer, 48, a dad and husband with more than 15 years experience in the job. One woman jumped into the River Thames to avoid the attacker's 4x4 as it drove at her, and is expected to survive after being rescued from the water and taken to hospital. Some MPs also described how armed military-style police stormed sections of the building. West Worcestershire MP Harriett Baldwin, who is in Malaysia doing ministerial work in her defence role, is flying back to Britain after being briefed on it. Witnesses described the attacker being an Asian man in 40s with an eight-inch long knife. Prime Minister Theresa May was seen being bundled into a silver Jaguar in the grounds of the palace just 40 yards from where the gunshots unfolded. Worcester's former Labour MP, who lost his seat in 2010, was at Westminster for meetings about his work fronting up an energy and utilities trade body. He left the palaces just after 1pm and tried to get back in just after 3pm, unaware of what had been unfolding moments earlier. Mr Foster, who was Worcester's MP from 1997 to 2010, is now chief executive of the Energy and Utilities Alliance and has not ruled out a return to politics.

He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. He was among those who died near parliament on Wednesday. Your Image was too big. Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. Three civilians, Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, and a police officer, Keith Palmer, have been identified as his victims. 27. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. Police released a picture of him on Friday. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and detained under the Terrorism Act was released on Sunday, Met police said in a statement. Eleven other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have also been released with no further action. The inquest into the death of Khalid Masood was adjourned on Thursday and a pre-inquest review has been set by the coroner for May 19. In all, Khalid Masood killed four people and injured more than 30 others in the March 22 attack before he was shot dead. One other person remains hospitalized in critical condition. Masood's cause of death was revealed Thursday in Westminster coroner's court, the Associated Press reported. Masood, 52, drove a car across Parliament Bridge, injuring scores of people, before crashing the vehicle into railings at the side of the houses of parliament. He then assaulted police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries, before being shot dead by officers on the scene. In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. That understanding may have died with him. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. There was nothing more you could have done. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. Authorities believe he acted alone. The 27-year-old man arrested late on Thursday in Birmingham was told he would face no further action. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London and bailed until the end of this month has also been released with no further action. As well as the six people released from custody last night, a 35-year-old man has been released with no further police action, and a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until the end of the month. Both were arrested in Manchester. Meanwhile, two men remain in custody: a 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham on Thursday morning, and a 28-year-old man arrested later in the day at a separate address in the city. They are being detained under the Terrorism Act 2000. One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. She is due to return to police until a date later this month. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Here's everything we know about him. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Read more about what we know so far here. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Read more about Masood here. The man had been in a hospital, and he was taken off life support. The man, who was not named, was one of two people who suffered life-threatening injuries in the attack. Around 23 people were injured in Wednesday's attack, and several were in critical condition. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Read more here. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Nothing to do with immigration. Read more here. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. Please continue to pray for our family. US president Donald Trump tweeted his condolences. My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. Many of the tributes included messages of condolence for PC Keith Palmer, the 48-year-old officer who died after he was stabbed outside the houses of parliament. Read more here. Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. No act of terror can shake the strength and resilience of our British ally. The very heart of the city has been struck. And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. The embassy said he had suffered a knee injury but has been discharged from hospital and that it is in contact with both their families. Read more here. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. Read more here. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Lords and MPs such as Tory MP Dominic Grieve, pictured here dodging some police tape, carried on regardless on Thursday. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. Read more here. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. Read more here. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. He has now been discharged from hospital. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Read more here. The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. Rowley also added that police understood Muslim communities might feel anxious, given previous actions by extreme right-wing groups following terrorist attacks. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Read more here. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The New York Daily News issued a correction after publishing the wrong name and photo. Investigators are treating it as terrorism, he reiterated, and the city will see an increased presence of armed and unarmed police starting immediately. They said the information was coming from colleagues in London. In fact, the image is from a 2013 incident when a man with a knife was tasered outside Buckingham Palace. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. But I know that the whole country will be thinking and praying for those who are affected, as I am. This is an ongoing incident and the Government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. Values symbolised by the Houses of Parliament. Six males and two females. Care is still ongoing. White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also released a statement in the form of a video on Twitter. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. He was pictured surrounded by medics and police officers giving CPR. Read more here. He said a police officer was among the dead, as well as a man believed to be an attacker. At least 20 people were injured. The number of those injured has not been confirmed. I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks. She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. Eyewitnesses, as well as social media accounts, appear to indicate a number of people were seriously hurt on Westminster Bridge. Earlier, a Reuters photographer, Toby Melville, published pictures of four individuals with injuries on the bridge. The Metropolitan Police Service is dealing with the incident and an urgent investigation is underway. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. I and my staff are safe and currently under lock down. This incident has not been separately confirmed by the Metropolitan police. Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. Emergency services are attempting to revive one individual lying down on the pavement on Parliament Street, some way away from the entrance to the building. Approximately a dozen armed police ran into the building shortly after 3pm."}

My parents walked out of the room and came back in.

He spoke of the crowds of who gathered peacefully in Trafalgar Square, the mainly Muslim women who stood holding hands on Westminster Bridge, the unity of faith leaders and the messages of defiance scattered among the flowers on the bridge. 'Best of humanity' Labour MP Mary Creagh said the mood at the service was both sombre and resolute. The Dean invited members of the congregation to light candles to honour the commitment. Prince William lit the first candle and the light was passed around to people at the service.

They swooped close to Westminster underground station. The scene where the man, aged 27, was arrested is metres away from where Khalid Masood launched his attacks on Westminster Bridge and the parliamentary estate five weeks ago, leaving five people dead, including himself. Masood used a vehicle to mow down pedestrians before using a knife to stab a police officer to death. The man was pinned to the ground after his arrest at 2.22pm, with armed officers standing over him. Shortly afterwards, forensic experts examined the ground where two knives had fallen, along with a bag, which is believed to have contained the knives. It is thought the suspect, who is believed to be from the London area but born outside the United Kingdom was acting alone. Given the location of the arrest, investigators believe one possibility was an attack on the Westminster or Whitehall areas. Past Islamist propaganda has called for attacks on civilians or symbols of power. Westminster arrest map Police said the arrest came at the junction of Parliament Street and Parliament Square, barely 30 metres from Westminster Bridge. Witnesses said the suspect wrestled to the floor by police but appeared calm after his detention. The motivation of the suspect will be a key part of the investigation and his mental health will be of keen interest to investigators. Knives have been recovered from him. The suspect was held on Parliament Street for more than half an hour, without speaking or struggling. While two officers detained him, about two dozen heavily armed police blocked off the traffic and pedestrians on one side of the road with tape. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A forensic officer examines items at the scene. Features of the arrest were highly unusual. Police prefer to arrest terrorism suspects in dawn raids at their homes, away from any potential target of attack. One source said there may have been a need to gather evidence to secure a conviction. Arresting someone in their home with knives poses challenges of convincing a jury that a terrorist attack was planned. Harry Peasnell, 27, and Andy Burnage, 22, were leaving a building adjacent to the scene which houses various government offices after a meeting with officials when they were told the usual entrance on to Whitehall was closed. As they left the area via an alternative route, they said they saw a man in his 20s or 30s, who they thought was the suspect, being spoken to by police next to the wall of the offices. Witness Ian Moss, who was travelling on a bus through Whitehall at the time, said the suspect was on the ground in the middle traffic island. He was very calm. I think they got him on the ground, then they stood him up against the wall. The incident unfolded with few MPs present in the Palace of Westminster because parliament is winding down before the election and May has already headed out on to the campaign trail. However, civil servants were still working as normal and a number of HMRC staff were locked outside their building when the Whitehall entrance was closed off. The atmosphere in parliament remained calm and all gates were operating as normal during the incident. The nervousness around security at Westminster was heightened when, in a separate incident, packages addressed to parliamentarians containing white powder were intercepted before they could reach their victims. The terrorism threat level for the United Kingdom remains at severe, meaning an attack by terrorists is assessed to be highly likely. The biggest threat is seen as coming from Islamic State, which constantly urges followers to stage attacks. All rights reserved."}

A Downing Street source declined to say where Prime Minister Theresa May was during the attack, but said she had not been involved and that she was safe.

For the incident in 2018, see 2018 Westminster car crash. For other uses, see Westminster attack. On 22 March 2017, a terrorist attack took place outside the Palace of Westminster in London, seat of the British Parliament. The attacker, 52-year-old Briton Khalid Masood, drove a car into pedestrians on the pavement along the south side of Westminster Bridge and Bridge Street, injuring more than 50 people, five of them fatally. He then crashed the car into the perimeter fence of the Palace grounds and ran into New Palace Yard, where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer. He was then shot by an armed police officer and died at the scene. Masood reportedly said in a final text message that he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries in the Middle East. Amaq News Agency, which is linked to Islamic State, said the attacker answered the group's calls to target citizens of states that are fighting against it, though the claim was questioned by the UK police and government. One of the victims, a Romanian tourist, was thrown by the car's impact over the parapet of the bridge into the River Thames below. Masood, wearing black clothes, got out of the car and ran around the corner into Parliament Square and through the open Carriage Gates where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer, PC Keith Palmer. Parliamentary staff were confined to their offices; journalists and visitors to Parliament were not permitted to leave the building. A fifth victim, Andreea Cristea, a 31-year-old tourist from Romania, fell into the Thames during the attack; she died in hospital as a result of her injuries on 6 April after her life support was withdrawn. He changed his name to Khalid Masood after he converted to Islam. Born in Kent, Masood was brought up in Rye, East Sussex, and later attended secondary school in Tunbridge Wells in Kent. In 2000, he was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm after a knife attack in a public house in Northiam in Sussex. Farasat Latif, director of the language school in Luton where Masood taught between 2010 and 2012, told The Guardian that when Masood lived in Luton he was apolitical and not aligned with the younger and predominantly Asian local radical Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun. Masood's profile was atypical in that most jihadi terrorists are under 30, while he was 52. The security services later recovered the last WhatsApp message sent by Masood shortly before his attack. InvestigationEdit Police and media outside the Hagley Road premises that were raided on 22 March, seen on the morning following the raid At 23:00 on 22 March, West Midlands Police raided a flat in Hagley Road, Birmingham. The investigation was named Operation Classific. By 25 March, only one man from Birmingham remained in custody and the woman on bail from East London had been removed from police enquiries. A one-minute silence in honour of the dead was observed in Parliament, and by London's emergency services, at 09:33. That evening, there was a public candlelit vigil in Trafalgar Square to honour victims of the attack. Amber Rudd appeared on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show to call for government backdoor access to encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, which Masood used to send a message shortly before the attack. She announced a meeting with similar technology industry leaders for 30 March, where she would persuade them to voluntarily co-operate with the government. The cameras recorded the involvement of the emergency room and intensive care staff over the next few hours, and then followed the cases of three patients until their discharge. The Independent.

The attack left at least four dead and dozens injured. Andrew Thorogood was in the English capital in October and crossed paths with PC Keith Palmer when the family visited the Houses of Parliament. Alice Springs jeweller Andrew Thorogood, his kids Alexsandra, 12, Georgia, 9, and slain PC Keith Palmer in London.Source:Supplied Mr Thorogood, originally from Townsville, met his wife Claire in Alice Springs when she was a backpacker, on holiday from the UK. He recognised the slain policeman when he was named in Australia on Thursday morning. Mr Thorogood still had the photo with PC Palmer on his phone. He seemed like a genuinely nice guy. We talked about the desert and Alice Springs. Keith Palmer was a police officer killed during the terrorist attack. Those injured in the attack included many foreigners. Here is what we know about the victims so far. The 48-year-old husband and father had been a police officer for 15 years and was part of the parliamentary protection force.

DOZENS INJURED Police said 29 of around 40 people wounded were treated in hospital. Four of the five Koreans who were injured in the attack have been released from hospital, according to The Korea Herald. Three Korean women and one man suffered broken bones during the attack. All were aged in their 50s and 60s. The four people discharged will return home on Saturday. The fifth person is awaiting a progress report after undergoing an operation. South Australian woman Patricia Neis-Beer, a German-born Australian resident from South Australia, was among those hurt when Masood used a speeding car to mow down tourists along the Westminster Bridge. Ms Neis-Beer, 54, who has a 26-year-old son called Jordan and a 19-year-old daughter called Paige and who works in an organic market and cafe in Stirling in Adelaide, was one of those injured in the first mass-casualty terrorism attacks on British soil in more than a decade. Mr Downer said Ms Neis-Beer was being well cared for and the consulate was providing her with assistance.

{"URL_s":"http://www.searchforthetruth.co.uk/westminster-bridge","Timestamp_s":"20180919055010","Sentences_t":"He may have been sacrificed to give the whole event some reality. False flag staged attacks are psychological warfare operations targeting the minds of the masses. Fabricated events can be used to further an agenda of the deep state and the perpetrators typically include CIA, MI6, MI5, MOSSAD, and DGSE (French Intelligence). We are told the person who carried out the Westminster attack was Khalid Masood (Adrian Russell Elms) who was a Christian until he allegedly converted to Islam in 2005, so he is not really a Muslim. What did this Muslim have to gain from this event, what was his objective in carrying it out, well he had none whatsoever. These false flags are now becoming so obvious with so many mistakes. Let us look at 13 reasons why this could be a fabricated or staged event. 1. Suspicious Video. The first piece of evidence is the video below which shows the only footage known of the car that was reported to have been involved in the Westminster terrorist attack. First the car looks more like a cartoon or ghost car in comparison to the other vehicles on the bridge. The video is below if you want to look at it. Look at the splash in the water on the video below, the splash is followed by a black streak. It is CGI, not real. Notice how the person (if it was a person) jumped into the water after the car has already gone by. In the past and in the present Milbank Tower has been used by a cluster of predominantly political organisations including the Conservative and Labour parties and the United Nations to name a few. Today it hosts a wide range of companies from PR agencies to the Ministry of Justice Records Management Service. One company in the Milbank Tower is Altitude London which was opened by former PM David Cameron in 2010. So we are led to believe the person who took this video just happened to have a video camera pointed at Westminster Bridge when this alleged car started its journey. The one thing that looks really odd is that the attacker was able to drive at speed over Westminster Bridge and mow down pedestrians. 2. Suspicious Photographers. Other photographs of the events of the attack were taken by one Stefan Rouseau who states on his website that he has spent the past 15 years travelling with and taking photographs of the Prime Minister. 3. The Woman under the Bus The two pair of legs sticking out from under the bus do not belong to a human being, it is a dummy or mannequin. We are told this woman got hit by a car and then the front wheels of a double decker bus went over this woman and then the back wheels went over this woman. It is not believable. It looks like this dummy was placed under the bus for shock effect meant to manipulate public consciousness. As mention earlier this photo was taken by Toby Melville. I used to be a fireman in London many years ago, and seen some real gory shit, trains that ran over people, trucks, all sorts. If she had been run over as depicted, she would have been flat, and there would have been a mass pool of blood and shit, up to a 3 to 4 meter radius of her body with all sorts splattered everywhere, be like you standing on a fly only much bigger of course. Now there is a few videos on Youtube which shows videos of someone moving along Westminster Bridge just after the alleged car mowed down pedestrians. It shows alleged injured people on the floor been attended to by members of the public. At the point that the lady in the pink jacket is taking photos, the car that allegedly mowed down all the pedestrians has already gone along past were she is standing because there is an injured person already near her on the floor. A screenshot is below. Do you get that, the lady in pink was not hit by the car. Now there is a another video of her lying injured in the same spot with blood near her as if she has been hit by the car and the same man standing next to her taking the photos is now acting as her helper. The screen shot is below of her lying injured. She was not hit by the car, it is a staged scene and she is an actor and probably paid huge sums for this fakery. Notice the man helping her, it is the same man who was stood near her taking photos. The Shoes Shoes were placed into a scene for some unknown reason. Here we have a photo which shows a man being attended to and there are no shoes by the side of the road. We now see a photo of the same man being attended to but this time with shoes carefully placed by the side of the road. Take a closer look at this picture. If he was in pain his knees would be resting on the ground, flopped over to the left or right and so would his left arm. It takes a lot of effort to stay in the position he is in, it is not believable. Look at the photo above, does the hand look real. The video is below which shows this more clearly. Video was removed by the Jewish run Youtube, sorry. In the photo below look at the man with the blue gloves he is holding the Policeman up by his feet now the Policemans head must be touching the floor. 7. The CCTV cameras for Westminster were taken off-line during the attack. CCTV on board the bus that blew up was also offline. The same Israeli Company who ran 911 airport security (No CCTV), ran the London bus CCTV during the attack. This alleged car that came onto the bridge must have came from somewhere in London. So where is the CCTV of this car approaching the bridge from its starting point, well they can't show it can they. London has more CCTV than any city in the world per population. 8. No Security The main gate into the grounds of parliament was left open and reportedly nobody was guarding the gate. Normally these gates are always kept shut. There are claims that no-one was on duty on the gate when the attacker entered. That place is a fortress. There is no way anyone could get into that area. There are armed guards at every entrance. At least four staff are usually stationed at all the gates, two outside and two inside. No one can enter that region. 9. The London Eye The London Eye was stopped during the Westminster attack for 3 hours. Whoever was behind the attacks had the London Eye stopped because if someone on the London Eye took a video of what really happened on the bridge then got off the London Eye with this evidence and disappeared, the this evidence could be the used at some point to prove the hoax. To stop this happening the London eye was stopped and as people got off their phones were checked by the Police to make sure they had no evidence of the alleged car driving along the bridge at high speed. 10. The Shot Assailant: Lack of Blood There was first news of the assailant being a Mr. Abu Izzadeen but later identity of killed assailant was given as Khalid Masood. The man originally alleged to be the main attacker, Trevor Brooks aka Abu Izzadeen, has links to MI6. The media found out they made a blunder and that Abu Izzadeen was alive in jail. But there is no real blood anywhere, including on the knife which was used to stab a Police officer. 322 is a big time satanic number and date, is the identifier of the Skull and Bones secret society of which many American Presidents were a member of. The truck attack in Stockholm, Sweden happened on April 7 th. Believe me the same organisation planned all the attacks and then convinced some patsie to carry it out and it was not Isis or Al Qaeda. The Illuminati and its intelligent (Psychopaths) agencies such as Mossad, CIA, MI5 and MI6 were behind all these attacks. It is not possible that these were random events. In July 2006 Netanyahu and former Irgun gang members attended a 60th anniversary celebration of this outrage and continue to claim that it was all the fault of the British and not the fault of the bombers. 12. Terror Drills Every major terrorist incident has had terror drills or training at exactly the same time as the terror incident was happening. 13. Israel Connection Every terror event from Manchester to Nice seems to get blamed on ISIS or ISIS claims responsibility. Did you know that an Israeli group SITE (Search for International Terrorist Entities) always announces first that terror events like Westminster, Manchester and Nice were allegedly done by ISIS. In fact any ISIS related news come from SITE first. It is run by a Jewish woman Rita Katz whose father was a Mossad spy. Look at this message that SITE tweeted before the Westminster attacks, seems they knew this would happen before it did. Or maybe it was just a Mossad (Israeli Intelligence) operation from the start. Click on the ISIS section of this website to see more information on that. My research says the ones behind the planning of this event were Mossad (Israeli Intelligence) with the help of MI5 and MI6. It is a psychological operation to keep in the minds of the masses of people and politicians that the Muslims are the real threat and that gives Israel the support it needs to slaughter the Palestinians and gives a legitimate reason to keep the wars in the Middle East rolling along, more Muslims slaughtered (4 million since 1990). But there are other reasons. After the Westminster attack Home Secretary Amber Rudd has demanded more action from social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Youtube to take down extremist videos, really she means videos that expose the false flag lies so no one will be able to find out the truth. She said new proposals are going to be implemented by the government to make internet giants take down so called hate videos. But in reality they are not hate videos but truth videos that try to expose the lies of the government. Also in government plans in the wake of this alleged attack is to deploy 5000 soldiers on the streets of the UK. This secret plan is codenamed Operation Temperer. The attack stopped parliament from voting on leaving the EU. So it disrupted the Brexit debate. Terror attacks also keep us divided especially Muslims and Christians. These terror attacks are happening in Christian countries in Europe and America and we are told the perpetrators are always Muslims. The global elites know full well that the Global Economic & Financial System is on the verge of collapse and that the banksters in London are the primary culprits. This would have been Impossible to pass without having the Charlie Hebdo Shooting. Once again, CCTV cameras were missing, drills and events that mimic the event played out just days earlier, and, the aftermath, the loss of personal freedoms and freedom of speech, plus troops on our streets being proposed. The Russians have potentially blown the whistle on the fact that the US war on Daesh was a fake. This is no accident. This is no accident. He may have been sacrificed to give the whole event some reality. False flag staged attacks are psychological warfare operations targeting the minds of the masses.

The programme reported that Abu Izzadeen, an Islamist activist formerly known as Trevor Brooks, was the person responsible for the terror attack who had been shot dead by police.

Fifty-two-year-old Briton Khalid Masood used a car and a knife to carry out an attack in the heart of London on Wednesday that left four people dead. He was killed by law enforcement on the scene. Rudd said she was not arguing for the government to access all messages on such platforms. Instead, she wants encrypted services to recognise they have a responsibility to engage with law enforcement agencies to counter terrorism. The rhetoric on Sunday highlighted a clash between digital privacy and national security that has been playing out globally in recent years. The most famous case so far has been Apple's tussle with the FBI. In 2016, the security service took on the Silicon Valley giant in an attempt to bypass the lock screen of the iPhone 5C used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook. Farook and his wife killed 14 people and wounded 22 more in San Bernardino, California in Dec., 2015. The U.S. Justice Department obtained a court order ordering Apple to assist the FBI in bypassing the phone's security, fearing that too many attempts to guess the passcode would wipe the phone's memory. The UK-based digital rights advocate Open Rights Group has warned that undermining encryption would make ordinary internet activities more vulnerable. The UK already has extensive laws allowing the government access to the internet footprint of its citizens. In late 2016, it passed the Investigatory Powers Act, also known as the Snoopers' Charter. The bill creates a quasi-internet history database that's accessible to law enforcement upon request, among other measures. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mr Ellwood became visibly upset as he recalled trying to explain to his son the terrorist outrage by Khalid Masood, who also ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The former Army officer said the hardest part of the day was arriving home and telling the eight-year-old, who had refused to go to bed, what had happened. Mr Ellwood, who has medical training, had desperately tried to save Pc Palmer's life by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and applying pressure on the wounds to stem the blood flow. A normal day in Parliament, very busy, very bustling. I saw what was going on , so I stepped forward. I was one of many people that stepped forward that day to do what we could. It's the heroes of the police force who guarded Parliament. We are still not able to better understand why people with a scant understanding of Islam are able to be recruited with a false promise of a fast-track to paradise. 'Hero' police officers 'defending Parliament' Mr Ellwood was walking through the Palace of Westminster when Masood ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing unarmed police officer Pc Palmer a year ago on Thursday. Well-wishers will be able to leave messages in a digital book of hope at City Hall from Thursday, a year since Khalid Masood's attack in Westminster. The tribute has been set up to mark the four terrorist atrocities that took place in the city last year - at Westminster Bridge, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green. We will never forget the bravery of our emergency services and first responders who ran towards danger while urging the rest of us to run to safety. Today we pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer, Kurt Cochran, Andreea Cristea, Aysha Frade and Leslie Rhodes. We stand with their loved ones in remembrance and solidarity. The planned memorial was agreed following meetings with bereaved families, survivors, members of the emergency services and local councils. MPs hold minute's silence to remember victims Leader of Westminster City Council Nickie Aiken said she would join the Lord Mayor to lay flowers in Parliament Square on Thursday.

It is one of a series of tweets from 2016 and 2017 which show for the first time how a network of Kremlin-backed accounts posted a number of anti-immigration and pro-Brexit messages around the time of the referendum and in the wake of major terror attacks. The account has now been identified by Twitter in evidence to the US congress as being backed by the Russians. The reaction that the tweet provoked at the time of the attack in March, in which five people were killed by Khalid Masood before he was shot dead by armed police, prompted the woman release a statement through Tell Mama, a group which monitors hate incidents against Muslims. She also thanked photographer Jamie Lorriman, who had spoken out in her defence and pointed out that other photographs had shown she was visibly upset. It was one of many accounts identified as Kremlin linked which were mainly focused on US politics but dabbled in wider issues in Europe. They have all been suspended by Twitter. The news comes as MPs prepare to begin an inquiry into Russian interference in British politics to which both Twitter and Facebook have been asked to give evidence. We've noticed you're adblocking.

Listen carefully. He did not say that Muslims will be the majority population in what is still recognizably Europe. We are not talking about Muslims here. We are talking about Islam. Lots of individual Muslims desire peaceful coexistence, even assimilation. Advertisement As we go to press, five innocent people are dead after Khalid Masood, a terrorist acting on unambiguous scriptural commands to war against non-Muslims, rammed his rental Hyundai SUV into dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, many of them tourists taking in the iconic views of Parliament. About 50 people suffered injuries, some of them grave, so the death toll may yet rise. Masood was born as Adrian Russell Ajao on Christmas Day, 1964, in Kent county, just outside London. Prior to that point, while fathering three children with his wife, he had several arrests, some for violent attacks. During at least one of the resulting stints in prison, like many inmates, he began indoctrination into Islam. He became an English language-teacher working for the Saudi government. When we speak of Islam, as opposed to Muslims, we are not speaking about a mere religious belief system. We are talking about a competing civilization. Masood returned to England from Jeddah about seven years ago. Advertisement There is diversity in Islam, including millions of Muslims who adhere only to its spiritual elements or see themselves as more culturally than doctrinally Islamic. But when we speak of Islam, as opposed to Muslims, we are not speaking about a mere religious belief system. It has its own history, principles, values, mores, and legal system. Advertisement Islam, thus understood, is not non-Western. It is anti-Western. Like the conversion of Masood, the conversion of Birmingham has been a function of this defining Islamic attribute. Islam does not melt into your melting pot. Islam, as Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna proclaimed, is content with nothing less than political, cultural, and civilizational dominance. As Soeren Kern relates in a comprehensive Gatestone Institute report on Islam in Britain, the metamorphosis of Birmingham, along with several other U.K. population centers, signifies this resistance. Marriages between Muslims resident in the Western community and Muslims overseas tend to result in childbirth rates and household growth that dwarfs that of the indigenous population. Arranged, intra-familial, and polygamous marriages, endorsed by Islamic mores, drastically alter the fabric of communities in short order. The migrant was surprised when the clergyman asked why he had chosen to move into their neighborhood. To a London reader, born and bred with multiculturalism, I know that my stories may come across as outlandish and exaggerated. . . . Advertisement Advertisement It is in that milieu that Khalid Masood made his decision, rented an SUV, and drove to Westminster Bridge. Western leaders have been content to accept these claims, at least as inspirational, if not operational. It is easier to indulge the fiction that ISIS catalyzes jihadism then to ask what catalyzed ISIS. But the remorseless fact is that before ISIS and al-Qaeda and the Khomeini revolution and Hezbollah and the Blind Sheikh and the Brotherhood and Khalid Masood, there was the single thing that unites them all. There was Islam. Western political and opinion elites remain willfully blind to this. Islam, however, does not separate mosque from state; the mosque is every bit as much a center for sharia indoctrination, assimilation resistance, and anti-Western politics as it is a prayer venue. The movement does not want cohabitation. It wants conquest. It starts with assimilation-resistant enclaves that nurture sharia supremacism today and thereby breed the jihadists of tomorrow. This week, it took the campaign to Westminster Bridge. She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes. But desperate times for liberals call for desperate measures. We have a name and an accusation, which is an improvement over the status quo ante."}

The 29-year-old man, a UK national and believed to be from the Midlands, was arrested by armed officers on suspicion of terror offences after a car mowed down pedestrians and cyclists before crashing into security barriers, installed to prevent terror attacks. The Met Police have confirmed that counter-terrorism officers are carrying out searches at three addresses in the Midlands, which include two in Birmingham and one in Nottingham. Dozens of emergency vehicles swarmed the area and members of public were ordered to clear the area as as more than 200 police officers descended on the scene within minutes.

The Ford Fiesta was in the Tottenham Court Road area from approximately 1:25am until 5:55am and then drove around Westminster and Whitehall from approximately 6:00am until the incident at 7:37am. Specialist officers from Project Servator, who are trained to recognise when a person is displaying minute signs of anxiety, have also been deployed in Westminster to identify anyone who may be in the area for terrorist or other criminal purposes.

Westminster tube station is currently closed. The Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Speaker offered their sympathies to those injured this morning outside Parliament. The Houses of Parliament are surrounded with security barriers of steel and concrete. The measures were extended in the wake of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017 when Khalid Masood ploughed a car into crowds on Westminster Bridge, killing five people, inlcuding a police officer. Khalid Masood ploughed a 4X4 into crowds before he was shot outside Parliament, injuring 50 people. Masood abandoned his car then stabbed and killed unarmed PC Keith Palmer before he was shot by armed police in a courtyard outside Parliament. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that since March 2017 13 Islamist plots and four far-right plots have been successfully foiled. There were 676 live investigations being carried out by the security services and counter-terror police at the end of June, up from more than 500 in March, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. Earlier this year, the Government unveiled a refreshed counter-terror strategy. Under the blueprint, MI5 intelligence will be shared with bodies outside the security community in an attempt to stop suspects before attack plots can crystallise, while anti-terror laws are to be strengthened to allow earlier interventions.

Attacker Khalid Masood, 52, killed four pedestrians and injured about 50 others as he mowed down members of the public with a car on Westminster Bridge at about 2:40pm on Wednesday. He then crashed his hired Hyundai SUV into the railings in front of Parliament Yard before bursting through the gate to the Palace of Westminster with two large knives where he fatally stabbed unarmed Pc Keith Palmer, 48. He was shot dead moments later by a close protection officer attached to Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon. The attack sent Westminster into lockdown and MPs were forced to stay put in the House of Commons for more than four hours while the area was made safe. Prime Minister Theresa May had just voted and was standing in members' lobby with other Tory MPs. She was seen being quickly ushered into a silver Jaguar in the grounds of the Palace of Westminster and whisked away to the safety of Downing Street. Three members of the public died following the car rampageon Westminster Bridge. They were mother-of-two Aysha Frade from London, US tourist Kurt Cochran from Utah and Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, south London. Pc Palmer and Masood also died despite attempts by paramedics to save them both. PC Keith Palmer, 48, died in the attack. Aysha Frade with husband John Frade Westminster attack victim Kurt Cochran . At least 50 people of 12 different nationalities were injured, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, two Greeks, and one each from Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and the United States. One of the injured has life-threatening injuries and two others are in a critical condition. Burly body-building enthusiast Khalid Masood, 52, was born in Dartford in Kent on Christmas Day 1964. His mother Janet Ajao gave birth when she was just 17 years old and brought him up as Adrian Russell Ajao. The married father-of-three spent years moving round the country - and the prison system - with a host of different identities, including Adrian Elms. He was most recently based in the West Midlands and had a history of violent knife crime, converting to Islam after years of criminality. Khalid Masood, circled, during his school days. He had a string of criminal convictions including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences, but he had not been convicted of any terrorism offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was investigated by MI5 some years ago over concerns of violent extremism but was no longer deemed to be a threat. Masood spent time in Lewes jail, East Sussex, Wayland, Norfolk, and Ford open prison, West Sussex for his offences. There is a good chance he was radicalised in prison. Khalid Masood is pictured being put into an ambulance just minutes after being shot by police. He later died. Two suspects, both men, remained in custody on Friday night. Seven people have been released with no further police action. A 32-year-old woman, arrested in Manchester, has been bailed pending further inquiries, while a 39-year-old woman arrested in east London has been released on bail until late March.
