{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/uk/382812-islamophobia-rise-westminster-attack/","text":"Islamophobia up after Westminster attack, say police... but Muslims disagree Hate crime against Muslims has increased in the wake of the terrorist attack in Westminster on March 22, according to the Metropolitan Police acting Commissioner for London. But Islamophobia monitoring group TellMAMA says it’s seen no such evidence. The Met suggested on Wednesday it had seen a “slight uplift” in Islamophobic attacks in the wake of the attack perpetrated by Muslim convert Khalid Massod. “We began tracking [Islamophobic activity] straight away and we keep that tracking in progress as we speak today. We saw a slight uplift in what we call ‘Islamophobic incidents’ the day after the event, but small, and far smaller than we have seen in previous events,” DC Craig Mackey told a London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee hearing. “I think the strength of all the faith leaders and the communities coming together and putting out a very strong message – that would’ve helped. People met within 24 hours of the incident, those messages went to Friday prayers and other gatherings that weekend and religious events, so I think that would’ve helped,” Mckey said. Unlike the aftermath of other terrorist attacks, such as the shootings in the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices or the November 2015 killings in Paris, there was no major backlash against the Muslim community. “After Westminster, we did not see what was expected and there was no major peak in anti-Muslim hatred picked up across the country. If there was, our work within TellMAMA would have immediately been alerted to this,” the charity said in a statement. “This is the first major terrorist incident in the last three years where there has not been a significant rise and peak in anti-Muslim hatred. There are times when we can feel a sense of hope and the last week provides us with a real window of hope. London truly is a great city.” “I also want to extend our solidarity to the many Muslims and migrants who at this time will be especially fearful of racism and abuse,” said National Union of Student (NUS) president Malia Bouattia said in a statement after the terrorist attack. “We must stand firm against all attempts to stoke up Islamophobia or intolerance against migrants of any nationality, especially at a time of increased hate crime against many communities across society.”","title":"Islamophobia up after Westminster attack, say police... but Muslims disagree — RT UK

{"originalUrl":"https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/justgiving-takes-control-of-westminster-attack-victim-fundraising-page-over-fraud-fears.html#sthash.bmefHdPH.dpuf","text":"Newspapers criticise JustGiving over Westminster victim's page Fundraising website JustGiving has faced criticism in a number of papers over its refusal to waive fees on fundraising pages for the victims of the Westminister attack. It is the second time this year that the fundraising platform has come under fire for the fees it charges for its service. A number of newspaper articles appeared over the weekend criticising JustGiving’s decision not to waive its fees on the fundraising page of PC Keith Palmer, who died following a terrorist attack on Westminster. The page has so far raised £730,000, meaning JustGiving will receive in the region of £30,000 of fees. However JustGiving has donated £10,000 to the page itself. “There have been questions about the fact that JustGiving charges for its service,\" the response said. \"We are honoured to be chosen to host millions of campaigns each year; saving children with cancer, funding pioneering surgery, remembering loved ones, building community projects, transforming education. “All of these causes are deserving, and each pays a transparent 5 per cent fee which is fully reinvested in innovation to ensure that the next person in need who comes to JustGiving can raise more than on any other platform.” “In these exceptional circumstances where an attack has hit the city that we at JustGiving call home, we opted to join our community and give a donation of £10,000. PC Palmer’s tragic death has touched the whole nation and in fact the world, and we are proud to have played our part in enabling the nation’s moving and generous response in his memory.” The response came after a number of newspapers, including The Sun, The Daily Mail and the Telegraph all criticised JustGiving for not waiving its fee on the pages for PC Palmer and the other victims of the Westminster attack. The Daily Mail accused JustGiving of “greed” and said it was “skimming” the fee off the top. It also reported that “a spokesman” from the Metropolitan Police Federation who set up the page, had said “he was ‘not happy’ about the cash going to JustGiving” and that it may ask JustGiving to make “a further contribution when the campaign ends”. The Sun on Sunday ran an editorial which said “if JustGiving had an ounce of decency it would hand over all donations to PC Keith Palmer’s grieving family” and suggested it would rather “cream a profit on Brits generosity”. Fraud concerns over victim's page JustGiving also confirmed it has taken control of one page set up to raise money for a victim of the Westminster attacks, after suspicions it had been set up to defraud donors. Donors to the page had found that the name of the person who’d set up the page originally had the same name “as a woman who had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2013”. The spokesman said that JustGiving had \"some concerns of possible fraud\" in relation to the page set up for Ms Frade, and as a result had taken over control of running the fund. “There was one page that was set-up where we had some slight suspicions and concerns of possible fraud,” said the spokesman. “We’ve now taken control of the page and are managing it to ensure that the money raised goes to the right people.” In Fundraising Magazine JustGiving have also put a message on Ms Frade’s fundraising page, and have said: “We’ve been carefully monitoring all of the pages that have been created to help those affected by Wednesday’s attack. We are ensuring that all of your kind donations are being used as intended. Because concerns were raised about this page, we are now managing it ourselves and reaching out to the family.” The page now carries a ‘verified by JustGiving’ sticker and has now raised £23,987 from 1,175 supporters. The spokesman said there was no suspicion or evidence to suggest any fraudulent activity had taken place with any of the other pages set up for victims of the Westminster attack, including the page set up for PC Keith Palmer.","title":"Newspapers criticise JustGiving over Westminster victim's

{"originalUrl":"http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9221","text":"Westminster Bridge attack: South Bank Patrol praised for response Security staff from the South Bank Patrol have been commended for their response to the Westminster Bridge attack on 22 March. Ch Supt Richard Wood with South Bank Patrol members Two members of the South Bank Patrol team were among the first to arrive at the scene of the attack, helping the injured, cordoning off the area, sending curious and confused pedestrians off the bridge and liaising with security and emergency services. Chief Superintendent Richard Wood, Lambeth's borough commander, commended the South Bank Patrol at a ceremony held at County Hall this week. Ch Supt Wood said: \"South Bank Patrol were some of the first people to arrive at the scene, they acted quickly and calmly in a chaotic situation where members of the public and professionals can often struggle to think clearly. \"We are very grateful and commend the speed and selflessness with which they acted.\" Govert Deketh, general manager of the London Marriott Hotel County Hall and chair of South Bank BID, added: \"The London Marriott Hotel County Hall immediately recognised the need for a base and offered the hotel as an operational triage centre for the Patrol and Met Police. \"The nature of this event demonstrates how well people and organisations pull together and collaborate. The London Marriott Hotel County Hall is a member of South Bank BID, and we highly value the work the South Bank Patrol have done for the last nine years.\" South Bank Patrol is managed by South Bank Employers' Group and funded through the South Bank Visitor Management Group – a public-private partnership of the major organisations on the South Bank and Lambeth Council. Revenue for the service is generated from London Eye section 106 contributions, private contributions from South Bank businesses and South Bank Business Improvement District (BID). • Last month St Thomas' Hospital staff were commended for their response to the attack.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/peer-blames-cycle-lane-on-westminster-bridge-for-terrorist-attack/020958","text":"Peer blames Westminster Bridge cycle lane for terrorist attack Lord Carlile has told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that yesterday's terrorist attack in London was, in effect, made easier by a paint-only cycle lane on Westminister Bridge. Lord Carlile is a crossbench peer and, from 2001 to 2011, he was the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. Speaking on the news programme at 7am from a radio car on the bridge he said the driver of the 4x4 which mounted the footway and killed pedestrians walking along the bridge had \"uninterrupted\" access to the footway because of a cycle lane. The attacker then abandoned his car and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer, a policeman guarding the Houses of Parliament. Lord Carlile said parliament was \"barely penetrated\" but that \"there may have to be changes in the way we protect parliament and other major buildings.\" He added: \"We may have to look at the new traffic arrangements around Westminster, which have changed in the last few months and opened up a wide new cycle lane along which this vehicle travelled uninterrupted.\" The parliamentary estate is ringed by public highways, including roads, footways and a small length of kerb-protected cycleway. However, the cycle lane on Westminster Bridge is protected by paint alone, although work is soon to start on adding kerbs to the cycle lane. Later in the programme a presenter asked London Mayor Sadiq Khan about easy access to the cycle lane, but Khan did not respond to that point. Former mayoral candidate Christian Wolmar said Lord Carlile's remark was an example of \"extraordinary hostility to cyclists.\" He asked, \"how can Lord Carlile think Westminster Bridge cycle lane made it easier to attack? Quite the opposite.\" The spot where the British-born attacker abandoned the 4x4 is just beyond the bridge and where the protected cycleway starts. It is also about 30 metres from where, in December last year, transport minister Chris Grayling \"doored\" a cyclist. Some MPs and peers blame London's cycleways for, among other things, congestion and air pollution. In 2015, Lord Lawson claimed that cycleways were more damaging to London than anything since the Blitz.","title":"Peer blames Westminster Bridge cycle lane for terrorist attack -

{"originalUrl":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/opinions/westminster-attack-security-services-russell-opinion/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","text":"JUST WATCHED Big Ben lit up honoring London attack victims MUST WATCH Big Ben lit up honoring London attack victims 00:46 Jonathan Russell is head of policy at Quilliam, a counter-extremism think tank in London. Joshua Stewart is a strategic communications officer there. The opinions in this article belong to the authors. Such full-spectrum, whole-of-society reactions are the only way to mitigate and dilute the effect of unsophisticated, \"lone wolf\" acts of terror. Read More Equally, the elasticity with which the police were able to absorb the shock of attack, contain the threat and then coordinate simultaneous raids across the country on known suspects -- without causing substantial fear or disruption to public life -- is remarkable. Despite this, there is, of course, room for us to assess the current security and intelligence picture; evaluate our strengths, limitations and what we can learn from this. \"He was not part of our current intelligence picture,\" British Prime Minister Theresa May read Thursday morning to a reconvened Parliament. From this language, it is possible that the attacker had proactively gone \"dormant\" in his overt extremist activities, so as to reduce the \"threat to life\" assessments from security services -- meaning they would turn their attention and resources elsewhere. At this stage, it is hard to say whether this was deliberate. If so, then it is extremely likely that other would-be attackers will be doing exactly the same thing. Digital and signals intelligence can only go so far. To carry out human surveillance on just one target requires several human officers. In short, prioritization is essential. This is where \"lone wolf\" terrorists, who usually operate outside of a command and control pattern, become immensely difficult to stop: The more sophisticated and preplanned the plot, the more likely security services can detect, deter and disrupt. Terrorists always look for the path of least resistance. This is why they fill post-conflict vacuums. But it is also why we have seen a proliferation of unsophisticated attacks in Europe. Trucks in Nice, France, and Berlin, cars and knives in London. Security services simply cannot prevent these in all cases. So where does this leave us? However tempting it is, we should avoid hinging our response around hard security measures. Counterintuitively, our best way of responding is to innovate and enhance our soft power and preventative approaches, so that would-be lone actors become less likely to slip through the net of society. Counter-extremism initiatives fill this gap. If extremist recruiters seek to manipulate grievances, teachers and youth workers must develop programs to address them through promoting democratic responses. As radicalizers identify the vulnerable experiencing identity crises and promote a ready-made group identity as a quick fix, we must proactively show them alternative pathways, preventing these people from becoming radicalized. Because ISIS promotes its fantasies so effectively online, we must enlist communications firms and social media experts to counter such narratives -- and moderate imams to challenge their pernicious Islamist ideology while also distinguishing it from Islam. It is incumbent on all parts of civil society to support this common cause to prevent terrorism. First responders and the security services do a wonderful job, but there are simply some things they cannot do alone.","title":"The Westminster attack was long overdue and couldn't have been prevented

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/03/david-cameron-neoconservative-cabinet?CMP=share_btn_tw","text":"George Osborne, a 'signed up, card-carrying Bush fan', told the Commons in 2003 he was persuaded of the 'excellent neoconservative case' for war with Iraq. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian David Cameron's recent offer to intervene in Libya, arming insurgents and enforcing a no-fly zone, was withdrawn almost as quickly as it was articulated. Objections from the US and France sank the idea. But it seems that the idea had enjoyed support from the cabinet, most of all from the hawkish faction around the education secretary Michael Gove – who is a signatory to the neoconservative Henry Jackson Society's statement of principles. Cameron, though no neocon, is a traditional Atlanticist, and has energetically promoted a small fraternity of foreign policy hawks since gaining the Tory leadership in 2005. They first emerged in defence of Tony Blair and his unpopular foreign policies. Cameron himself, though he only reluctantly voted for the Iraq war, greatly admired Blair's stance in the debacle. Even he, though, could hardly match Gove's gushing praise for Blair in the runup to the Iraq war, in a column for the Times entitled \"I can't fight my feelings any more: I love Tony\". This passion for Blair was not restricted to his stance on foreign policy – it included Blair's position on the firefighters' strike, asylum seekers and tuition fees – but it was on Iraq that Gove maintained Blair was \"behaving like a true Thatcherite\". Indeed, for many Tories , Blair is neocon rex. Gove is the author of a number of neoconservative tracts. These include Celsius 7/7, which argues that Islamists are waging \"total war\" against the west, not because of imperialism but because of their root-and-branch rejection of \"western values\". A more pointed intervention, though, was the essay \"The Very British Roots of Neoconservatism and Its Lessons for British Conservatives\". In it, Gove was trying to persuade Tory allies sceptical of the adventurism of Rumsfeld and Bush that their policies were ones that the great patriarchs of conservatism would approve of. He argued that neoconservatism had strongly British roots that could be traced back to the statecraft of the Anglo-Irish Tory leader George Canning, whose pre-emptive battles with Bonapartism helped \"advance the cause of freedom\". Palmerston and Churchill were also given their due as precursors to modern neoconservatism. Significantly, Gove's trinity was entirely composed of Tories with some connections to Liberalism – if a neoconservative is a liberal who has been \"mugged by reality\", many Tory luminaries from Burke onward have been instinctive Whigs turned counter-revolutionary. Alongside Gove in the neoconservative faction are Ed Vaizey, the under-secretary of state who is, like Gove, has also signed up to the Henry Jackson Society's principles. Similarly, George Osborne, the chancellor, is a \"signed up, card-carrying Bush fan\", persuaded of the \"excellent neoconservative case\" for war with Iraq. His PPS, Greg Hands MP, is also a signatory to the Henry Jackson Society. Neoconservative ideas are also propagated in a number of thinktanks such as Policy Exchange whose director, Nicholas Boles MP, is another Henry Jackson Society signatory. The magazine Standpoint provides monthly ballast to this tendency. Despite often crucial tactical differences, such as those which have emerged over Libya, there is a shared vocabulary between neoconservatives and those, like William Hague, who articulate a \"liberal conservative\" foreign policy. Hague has vocally supported \"humanitarian intervention\", and was reluctant to criticise even the more controversial stances of Blair, such as his support for the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. This gave the Tories few opportunities to land any damaging blows against New Labour. Indeed, the \"liberal interventionist\" stance devised by Hague and Cameron amounts to reheated Blairism. The neoconservative agenda is not restricted to foreign policy, but includes a securitarian drive to contain Islamism and propagate \"British values\". Cameron's recent speech announcing the failure of multiculturalism can be seen as a tilt toward the neoconservatives in his cabinet. Yet the neoconservative temptation is a dangerous one for Cameron to succumb to. It offers moral and intellectual definition to an aggressive but vacillating government lacking legitimacy. If Cameron is a poorly defined leader, neoconservative belligerence can provide a far more robust political direction than the \"big society\". But Cameron still needs his Liberal allies, and the electoral base for neoconservatism is smaller even than for the aggressive Thatcherism he jettisoned in opposition. If Cameron were to openly embrace the neoconservative agenda, it would be a retreat from the electoral coalition-building that has temporarily saved the Tories from irrelevance.","title":"The siren

{"originalUrl":"https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps-london-north-london-south/news/man-jailed-encouraging-others-take-break-come-jihad","text":"One video showed photos of men firing assault rifles and fighters on horseback holding Daesh flags while leading a procession of vehicles. Other featured images of Osama Bin Laden, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Daesh, and prominent convicted UK extremists including Anjem Choudary and Abu Hamza or called on the viewer to, ‘Take a break, come to jihad’. An eighth video, the only one not made by Staples, featured the logo of a media organisation used by Daesh to release propaganda material. Staples uploaded the video to his YouTube account. In the video an armed man wearing camouflage says that the only path to victory is through sacrifice and jihad. The song that is playing is in English and mentions fighting unbelievers, that there were “maidens of Paradise awaiting the martyrs” and “we are the men who love death just as you love your life”. Staples posted the videos between May and September 2016 and had more than 1,000 followers on the accounts. The CPS argued that each video glorified violent jihad and his intention was to encourage others to fight for Daesh. On 24 January he was found not guilty of one count of encouraging terrorism. When questioned by police, Staples denied having extremist or political views; he said the videos were only pictures with no political purpose. During the trial, he gave evidence that he had created one of the videos but claimed that two men he had limited details for had visited his house and must have created the remaining videos without his knowledge. The court heard that in January 2016 he had been convicted of child cruelty after showing a young child a video of jihadist beheadings. Staples received a nine month prison sentence and began publishing these videos shortly after his release. After his conviction in January, Sue Hemming from the CPS said: “Gary Staples created and published propaganda videos glorifying violent jihad but falsely claimed that he was not an extremist. “When the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence that they were made on his electronic devices he invented a story which the jury clearly saw through and concluded that his intention was to encourage those who viewed them to prepare or commit terrorist acts.” Notes to editors Notes to editors •On 24 January, Gary Staples (dob 25/4/1967) was found guilty of seven counts of encouraging terrorism contrary to section 1(2) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and one count of disseminating a terrorism publication contrary to section 2(1) and 2(2)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006. He was found not guilty of one further count of encouraging terrorism. •Sue Hemming is Head of the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division in the CPS.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/888567/terror-inquiry-terrorism-MI5-manchester-attack-westminster-london-bridge?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","text":"Related articles MI5 and counter-terrorism policing got a great deal right – particularly in the case of Manchester – they could have succeeded had the cards fallen differently. David Anderson QC In the case of the London Bridge attack in June, Mr Anderson said the security service was “actively” investigating fanatic Khuram Butt when he masterminded and led the slaughter. Eight people were murdered when British national Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, drove a van at victims on the pavement, then leaped out and began stabbing them. Butt, who led the two other jihadis in the attack before they then targeted drinkers in bars near the bridge, had been the subject of a two-year MI5 probe. All three were shot dead by police. PA The London Bridge attackers were also known to MI5 The inquiry said Butt, who had appeared in Channel 4 documentary The Jihadis Next Door, was the subject of “coverage” from the middle of 2015. Mr Anderson’s report read: “Material relating to Khuram Butt received in the two weeks prior to the attack on June 3 added little to the intelligence picture and did not identify the activity that led up to the attack.” It went on to highlight that Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood also had been a subject of MI5 interest in the past. Masood killed four pedestrians in March by driving into them on the bridge. PA MI5 have been watching 'unprecedented' terror threats to the UK this year He then leaped out and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer outside the House of Commons. The report said although Masood carried out trial runs, the 52-year-old was a “closed” subject when the attack was launched. The review findings are published as Britain faces an “unprecedented” terror threat after a total of nine Islamist plots were thwarted in the last year, ministers have been told. MI5 chief Andrew Parker told Theresa May and her senior ministers yesterday that MI5 and counter-terrorism policing are currently running more than 500 “live operations”, a third up since the beginning of the year, involving roughly 3,000 “subjects of interest”. GETTY Andy Burnham said \"wrong judgements have been made\" In total, 35 innocent people – including children and their parents at the Ariana Grande concert – were killed in the three major attacks. Mr Anderson’s report said: “Substantial and appropriate coverage was in place around key individuals, and mechanisms designed to assess risk were working. “MI5 and counter-terrorism policing got a great deal right – particularly in the case of Manchester – they could have succeeded had the cards fallen differently.” Home Secretary Amber Rudd said blame for the “cowardly” attacks “lies squarely” with the terrorists. However, Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham said: “It’s clear things could and perhaps should have been done differently and wrong judgments have been made.” Two men arrested by counter terrorism police in London and Birmingham last week have been charged with plotting attacks.","title":"Terror inquiry: MI5 'may have stopped attack on Manchester Arena' | UK | News |

{"originalUrl":"https://conatusnews.com/thoughts-in-the-wake-of-westminster-bridge-terror-attack/","text":"Thoughts after the Westminster Bridge Terror Attack I come out of the northern line and walk out of the station. It’s a normal afternoon and I’m meeting a friend after work. As I make my way down the street and towards the bridge, I hear what sounds like a thud. Then I hear screaming, and then three shots. It’s happening on the other side of the bridge, but I feel terror inside me. I half run, half walk, to the accommodation building opposite the bridge. I don’t know how long it takes to get there, time isn’t working properly in my head. I feel sick, and people are filming on their smartphones in confusion. A blonde woman stands staring at me as I lean against the wall, wondering if I’m going to vomit. “It’s okay.” She says, feebly. “Don’t worry, you’re okay.” I’m fine. I was never at risk at all. I was on the other side of the river to where the innocent people were murdered. However, I was scared, frightened, in shock. I want to scream, burst into tears, hit something. Yet I can’t, so I sit down inside the reception and regain my composure. Outside, the sickening sound of ambulances and police cars builds up. Feeling rather morbid I watch, not knowing what else to do. It will take several hours for me to calm down. Everyone is in shock. This is incredibly unlikely, I say to myself, repeatedly. This doesn’t happen regularly at all. London isn’t a war zone. You are fine. My friends are also behaving weirdly in their shock. They go from silent horror, to attempts at humour, to almost excitement. It’s funny how the brain copes with fear. My friend’s mothers, and mine, are checking in on us, erratically. Some want us to come back from university early. London’s not safe. London’s not safe. Hours after the attack, the tension is palpable. Let’s be honest: we are scared. People being murdered in cold blood is scary. Especially when it happens so close to home. Terrorists know that. That’s why they do it. So: Don’t let them win. It’s horrifying, it’s horrific, it’s evil, but don’t be frightened. Go out tomorrow and walk the streets, attend that party and go and watch that film. Show them that we don’t give in to fear; that London is stronger than giving into threats and terror. We don’t need to resort to violence and hatred to get through the day. We will not make a terror attack worth it.","title":"Thoughts after the Westminster Bridge Terror Attack - CONATUS

{"originalUrl":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tommy-robinson-london-terror-attack-islamic-extremism-westminster-bridge-a7644676.html","text":"A video of the far-right leader, who led the EDL from 2009 until 8 October 2013, appeared on Rebel Media, a fringe right-wing Canadian media company ( LNP ) Tommy Robinson has been widely condemned for launching into a tirade about Islamic extremism at the scene of a suspected terrorist attack in Westminster. The former English Defence League leader rushed to the Houses of Parliament in London after news of the attacks emerged. Although details about the alleged assailant and their motive remains unclear, Mr Robinson claimed Britain was at “war” with Islamic fundamentalists. While ambulances and other emergency vehicles dominated scenes, Mr Robinson shouted aggressively at those who challenged him and launched into a scathing analysis of the incident for his personal camera crew. After a reporter suggested Mr Robinson has been quick to label the incident a foreign terrorist attack, the far-right leader said: \"This is the reality. The reality is these people are waging war on us. \"This has been going on for 1,400 years and while it's going on the police leaders and the political leaders want to invite more.\" But Mr Robinson has been denounced for his intervention, with people accusing him of simply inflaming the situation and exploiting the tragedy for his own gain. “Far-right figures like Tommy Robinson are vile opportunists: using victims of today's attack to spread their anti-Muslim message,” Maya Goodfellow, a journalist, said on Twitter. “Far-right hate preacher Tommy Robinson is in London exploiting today's terror attack. The man lower than vermin,” said Scott Nelson. \"Tommy Robinson thinking about himself and his agenda rather than the victims in the immediate aftermath. Tells you all you need to know,\" added another. “Tommy Robinson really jumped on the 16:09 Southeastern service to come and milk this tragedy,” quipped another critic. A video of the far-right leader, who led the EDL from 2009 until October 2013, outside the Houses of Parliament appeared on Rebel Media, a fringe right-wing Canadian media company after he went down to the scene. Mr Robinson announced he was leaving the EDL in 2013 in a joint conference with think tank Quilliam. His departure was widely covered, with the former leader later telling police he would help with their investigations into alleged racists within the extremist group. Proceedings at Parliament were suspended on Wednesday afternoon after a police officer was stabbed and an alleged assailant shot by armed police outside the Houses of Parliament, shortly after a vehicle is reported to have mowed into members of the public on Westminster Bridge. Police are treating the Westminster shooting which took place on Wednesday afternoon as a terrorist incident until further notice.","title":"Tommy Robinson condemned for ranting about Islamic

{"originalUrl":"http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/police-make-new-arrest-after-westminster-terror-attack/article/488857#.WNgwpB3CWxQ.twitter","text":"New arrest over London attack as govt eyes WhatsApp British police investigating a deadly attack on parliament made a new arrest Sunday as officials set their sights on accessing WhatsApp, the heavily-encrypted messaging service that was used by the killer. The arrest came four days after the lightening assault that unfolded in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament, in which an apparently lone attacker killed four people and wounded 50 before being shot dead by armed police. The latest arrest was a 30-year-old man who was detained in the central city of Birmingham on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts, London's Metropolitan Police said. A dozen people have been arrested since Wednesday's attack by 52-year-old Khalid Masood who deliberately ran down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge then stabbed a policeman just inside the gates of parliament. Nine people have been released without charge, while a 58-year-old man remains in custody and a 32-year-old woman has been released on bail. The arrest came as the government confirmed Masood had used the WhatsApp messaging service, saying it was crucial that the security services be allowed to access the heavily-encrypted app. Media reports said Masood used the Facebook-owned service just minutes before staging his assault, although it was unclear whether he sent any messages or just looked at the app. Speaking to Sky News, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was \"completely unacceptable\" that police and security services had not been able to crack the heavily-encrypted service. \"You can't have a situation where you have terrorists talking to each other -- where this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message -- and it can't be accessed,\" she said. - 'Don't let them hide' - Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was \"completely unacceptable\" that police and security services had not been able to crack the heavily-encrypted service WhatsApp Adrian DENNIS, AFP/File Police had on Saturday acknowledged they may never know why Masood, a Muslim convert with a violent criminal past, carried out the attack and that he probably acted alone, despite a claim of responsibility by the Islamic State group. \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this. That understanding may have died with him,\" said senior counter-terrorism officer Neil Basu. Although police believe he acted alone on the day, investigators are still trying to find out whether he was encouraged or directed by others. \"There should be no place for terrorists to hide,\" Rudd said in a separate interview with the BBC. \"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp -- and there are plenty of others like that -- don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.\" WhatsApp said it was \"horrified\" by the attack and was working with the investigating authorities without saying whether it would change its encryption policy. \"We are horrified at the attack carried out in London earlier this week and are cooperating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations,\" a spokeswoman told AFP. - Must be accessible - Rudd acknowledged that end-to-end encryption was vital to cyber security, to ensure that business, banking and other transactions were safe -- but said it must also be accessible. An armed police officer stands at an entrance to the Houses of Parliament in central London on March 26, 2017 DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS, AFP \"It's not incompatible. You can have a system whereby they can build it so that we can have access to it when it is absolutely necessary,\" she told Sky News. Rudd said she did not yet intend to force the industry's hand with new legislation, but would meet key players on Thursday to discuss this issue, as well as the \"constant battle\" against extremist videos posted online. Tech firms and social media players are coming under increasing pressure over extremists using their websites, applications and technology to communicate extremist content. Last year, US authorities fought a legal battle with tech giant Apple to get it to unlock a smartphone used by one of the shooters in a 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California. The FBI's own experts ended up breaking into the device.

The extra cash will increase intelligence and surveillance capabilities and pay for armed officers to patrol city centres. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, secured the rise in next year’s police counter-terrorism budget to at least £757m after convincing the chancellor, Philip Hammond, more money was needed to protect the public. Rudd said: “This represents our commitment to backing the talented and brave counter-terrorism forces with the resources they need to keep people safe. “Since 2015 alone we have increased counter-terrorism spending by 30% and pledged more than £500m in increased funding for the counter-terrorism budget, to protect the UK from the ongoing threat posed by terrorism. “This [latest

{"originalUrl":"http://www.thestar.co.uk/whats-on/out-and-about/beaten-to-death-1-322541","text":"BEATEN TO DEATH A UNIVERSITY of Sheffield student has been murdered abroad after clashing with a gang of youths who made fun of his fiancee. Foreign student Darren Kang Ten Hua, aged 23, was beaten to death during his summer break back home in Kuala Lumpur. The second-year law student, his 24-year-old fiancee and two other friends were about to have a meal in the early hours of Tuesday morning when a fight broke out. As they waited to be seated at the restaurant in Desa Sri Hartamas, Darren's fiancee, Goh Win See, called \"I love you\" to him. Another group of men sitting nearby, aged between 18 and 26, laughed and made comments. Goh, a customer service officer at an insurance company, said: \"Several of the men seemed to laugh at Darren and passed comments among them. \"This agitated Darren who then confronted one of them, asking them why the group had behaved in such a way.\" Goh, who had been dating Darren since they were 15, said she pleaded with him not to get involved. She said: \"One of them got up from his seat and began swearing at Darren with several others joining in. \"Within seconds, four of them cornered Darren and began kicking and punching him repeatedly. \"Others used sticks and the rest used plastic chairs to hit him.\" The beating lasted for 15 minutes, during which time Darren managed to call his friend on his mobile. The pal said: \"He said he was at Uncle Don's Restaurant and was getting beaten to death. He asked me to come quickly.\" By the time the friend got there half an hour later, Darren had already been taken to hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival from neck and head injuries. His two friends and Goh were unhurt. 11 men were arrested. Darren, who had a step sister, returned home from Sheffield three weeks ago. He was staying with his mother in the town of Mont Kiara. His 48-year-old mother said: \"Was it wrong for Goh to say 'I love you' to my son? It was a conversation between Goh and Darren but for that my only son is gone. Those who killed my son must be brought to justice. \"What was said between Goh and Darren was their own business.\" The couple had been engaged since last July and were planning to marry after Darren graduated. He was due to return to Sheffield at the end of July. Goh said: \"We have known each other since we were in secondary school. Darren was a caring and jovial person. We had already bought the air tickets to return to England.\" It is believed his funeral and cremation have already taken place. Today Sheffield University paid tribute to their student. Student Support and Welfare officer Debora Green said: \"Our thoughts and sympathies are with Darren's family, fiancee and friends at this sad time. \"This is a tragic loss and Darren will be sorely missed by all those who knew him. \"We have contacted Darren's family and friends to pass on our condolences, and to offer our support during this difficult time.\"","title":"BEATEN TO DEATH - The

Within hours of a terrorist attack in London that killed four victims and injured dozens on March 22, the oldest son of US president Donald Trump took aim at the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. Referencing the headline of a September 2016 article in the Independent about the mayor, he tweeted: The tweet quickly drew ire on Twitter, not only for the poor judgment and insensitivity so soon after a tragedy, but also because Trump Jr., whether intentionally or by accident, misrepresented the article and words of Khan, the city’s first Muslim mayor. Taken out of context, the article’s headline, “Sadiq Khan: London mayor says terror attacks ‘part and parcel’ of living in a major city,” might suggest that Khan was excusing a terror attack. But a full read of the article, published after a September 2016 explosion at a construction site in New York, makes clear that Khan was advocating for more city preparedness and for Londoners to help combat terror threats: Sadiq Khan has said he believes the threat of terror attacks are “part and parcel of living in a big city” and encouraged Londoners to be vigilant to combat dangers. The Mayor of London revealed he had a “sleepless night” after the recent bombing in New York, and said major cities around the world “have got to be prepared for these sorts of things” to happen when people least expect them. The article went on to quote Khan as saying: “That means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities, it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice”, Mr Khan told the Evening Standard shortly before a meeting with New York mayor Bill de Blasio. Critics on Twitter surmised that Trump Jr. had only read the article’s headline and jumped to conclusions: @DonaldJTrumpJr he is not saying that at all.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/24/westminster-attack-leslie-rhodes-the-nicest-man-you-ever-met?CMP=share_btn_tw","text":"Leslie Rhodes was believed to have been on Westminster Bridge after a visit to St Thomas’ hospital. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images The fourth person to die in the terror attack on Westminster has been named as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Clapham, south London, described as “a lovely man” by shocked neighbours. Rhodes, a retired window cleaner, died on Thursday night in King’s College hospital after his life support system was withdrawn. His identity was confirmed by the Metropolice police’s acting deputy commissioner, Mark Rowley, on Friday morning. London terror attack: police name fourth fatality and make two 'significant' arrests – live Read more Rhodes was unmarried, lived alone in a flat on Macauley Road, just off Clapham Common, and was said by neighbours to have been “fit as a fiddle”. He was believed to have been in the area to visit St Thomas’ hospital, on the south corner of Westminster Bridge, and was crossing the bridge to catch a bus. Some of his neighbours had kept a bedside vigil for him at King’s College hospital. His nextdoor neighbour Michael Carney, 74, who had known Rhodes for about 40 years, described him as “as nice a man as you could meet – he was just like one of my family”. “You couldn’t let someone like that die alone,” he told the Guardian. “I couldn’t get out, but my wife, Christine, and my two daughters went up there and stayed with him. He couldn’t have got better care than the hospital. They were all amazing. The doctors kept on past their shift to stay with him and the nurses were playing him Queen music when they heard he really liked them.” Rhodes had moved to Clapham from Battersea with his family in the 1970s but had lived alone since his parents and brother died some years ago. “He was really healthy. You’d have said he’d have lasted into his 90s at least,” Carney said. “Even though he was supposed to be retired he was still up ladders, he still did some window cleaning for friends and private jobs.” Carney said he and Rhodes both liked betting on horses and on Thursday he had knocked on his friend’s door to ask him to put some money on a race. He got no answer twice, but the third time heard voices and used his spare key to check if the flat was being burgled. “There were two police in there and they said they couldn’t tell me everything, but he was hurt really bad and they didn’t think he’d make it,” he said. Carney said his wife and daughter were heartbroken over their neighbour’s death. “He was a ladies’ man – don’t get me wrong, I mean in the best sense, he liked women and they liked him. He was a lovely man.” London attack: what we know so far Read more Philip Williams, a former neighbour, said: “He would do anything for anybody. It’s such a shock.” Williams said: “I’ve been told he was hit in the midriff. He had many broken bones. Apparently he went into a coma straight away.” The Labour MP Chuka Umunna paid tribute to Rhodes on Twitter. Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) 1/2 Deeply saddened to hear that my constituent Leslie Rhodes has died from the injuries he sustained in Wednesday's shocking & awful attack The Streatham Central church tweeted that members were praying for Rhodes and his family, and Zepharine Greene tweeted: “RIP Leslie, you will be missed by friends from Macaulay.” The husband of another of the victims, Aysha Frade, who was killed on Westminster Bridge while on her way to pick up their two daughters from school, has also paid tribute to his wife. He posted a message on Facebook describing her as “the most beautiful flower in our garden of joy”. John Frade posted an image of a white ceramic rose on his page with the verse: “Roses are usually red, our angel who was never blue, the most beautiful flower in our garden of joy, protect us from heaven in all that we do.” Friends and relatives poured in messages of sympathy to him and their daughters. Frade is Portuguese, and his wife was born in Britain of Cypriot and Spanish parents. In her mother’s home town, Betanzos, in Galicia, where two of her sisters live, a minute’s silence was held and two days’ mourning declared. She was also mourned by colleagues at the DLD sixth-form college in London, where she worked as an administrator. The principal, Rachel Borland, said: “She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us.”","title":"Westminster attack: Leslie Rhodes 'the nicest man you ever met' | UK news | The

While no amount of money will bring back lives lost or take away from the pain the victims and their families are going through, we hope to lessen their burden in some way as citizens, Londoners, and human beings.\" Throughout the country and around the world, people remained hopeful and strong, refuting Islamophobia and taking to social media to show their support and remembrance for the heroes and victims of the attack Ahmed described how all funds raised by the campaign will go to help those affected. \"Thank you for considering supporting the victims and the families of victims of this tragic attack through this fundraiser. We will ensure that 100% of funds collected through this campaign will go to the victims and the families of the victims most affected by the tragic events that unfolded on March 22, 2017. We will be coordinating with the Met Police Foundation (who have coordinated efforts for funds to be raised on behalf of PC Keith Palmer) and others to ensure that the funds go where they are

{"originalUrl":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/world/europe/london-attack-victims-westminster-parliament.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share","text":"LONDON — One was a police constable who spent 15 years with the Metropolitan Police in London. A second was a teacher who, according to reports, was walking from her school along Westminster Bridge. Another was a man from Utah who was on vacation with his wife, celebrating their 25th anniversary. The fourth was a 75-year-old man, whose family removed him from life support. They were all killed by an assailant who plowed through pedestrians on the bridge — injuring at least 50 others in the heart of the city — crashed his vehicle into a fence and then emerged with knives to stab the constable on Wednesday. Among the wounded, many of them foreign tourists, were 12 Britons, four South Koreans, three French high school students, two Romanians, two Greeks and one citizen each of China, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the United States. On Thursday afternoon local time, the police identified the assailant, who was shot and killed by officers, as Khalid Masood, 52. In a speech at Parliament, Prime Minister Theresa May said the attacker was British-born and was previously investigated by MI5, Britain’s domestic counterintelligence agency, for possible ties to violent extremism. The prime minister visited victims at a hospital in London for 40 minutes on Thursday, according to her office. Many of them had not been publicly identified. At a news conference, Mark Rowley, the assistant police commissioner, cited both the police investigation and the need to notify family members as reasons. But information has dribbled out. Image Keith Palmer, 48, a police constable, was one of three victims killed in the attack in London on Wednesday. The assailant was killed.CreditMetropolitan Police/Press Association, via Associated Press ■ Police Constable Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was patrolling the Parliament building when the assailant fatally stabbed him. Tributes for Constable Palmer have poured in. “He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen,” Commissioner Rowley said in a statement. Mayor Sadiq Khan said, “Keith Palmer was killed while bravely doing his duty — protecting our city and the heart of our democracy from those who want to destroy our way of life.” James Cleverly, a lawmaker, said on Twitter that he had served in the Royal Artillery with Constable Palmer, calling him “a lovely man, a friend.” ■ Kurt Cochran, an American traveling in Europe with his wife, Melissa Payne Cochran, died of injuries sustained in the attack, according to a statement from the family issued through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City. Clint Payne, Mr. Cochran’s brother-in-law, said in the statement: “Our family is heartbroken to learn of the death of our brother- and son-in-law, Kurt W. Cochran, who was a victim of Wednesday’s terrorist attack in London. Kurt was a good man and a loving husband to our sister and daughter, Melissa. They were in Europe to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, and were scheduled to return to the United States on Thursday.” Mr. Cochran’s wife was also wounded in the attack, and she was hospitalized with “a broken leg, a broken rib and a cut on her head,” said her sister Sarah Payne-Mcfarlane in a post on Facebook. Their parents were serving as missionaries in London, according to the church. The couple ran a recording studio in West Bountiful, Utah, and Mr. Cochran had shared pictures of their stops in Germany and Scotland. Image A Facebook picture of Aysha Frade, 43, a British teacher who lived in London with her husband and two daughters. ■ Aysha Frade, 43, a British teacher, lived in London with her husband and two daughters. She taught Spanish not far from Westminster Bridge, according to the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, and she had family in Spain, according to the Spanish Foreign Ministry. Ms. Frade’s mother immigrated to Britain from Betanzos, a Galician town in northwestern Spain. Ms. Frade’s two sisters run the Academia Notting Hill language school in Betanzos and live in a village nearby. Her father is of Turkish Cypriot descent, a family friend said. On Thursday, the Betanzos town hall held a moment of silence at noon to honor Ms. Frade. Local leaders decreed three days of mourning. Ms. Frade, 43, was a British citizen, but “her link with our town was always very strong,” José Luis Pariente, a Betanzos town hall official, said by phone. “She came back here to visit every summer.” Amy Winter, the family friend and a neighbor in the Notting Hill district of London, said on the phone: “When I think of Aysha, I think of her radiant smile. She always cheered people up.” “It crushes me to know that she was going to pick up her girls when she was killed,” she said, adding, “They were everything to her.” Rachel Borland, the principal of DLD College London, said in a statement: “We are all deeply shocked and saddened at the news that one of the victims yesterday was a member of our staff, Aysha Frade. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family.” ■ Leslie Rhodes, 75, a retired window cleaner from the Streatham neighborhood of south London, was injured in the rampage. He was removed from life support on Thursday. One of his neighbors, Michael Carney, told local news media that he had known Mr. Rhodes for 40 years, calling him “the nicest mind you ever met.” Another neighbor described Mr. Rhodes as “fit as a fiddle” and said he wasn’t married and had no children. Mr. Carney said his own relatives went to the hospital to be by Mr. Rhodes’s side. “My wife and my two girls went up there and were with him until he died, playing him music,” Mr. Carney said. “He liked Queen and that.” He added: “He had no one. You can’t have someone dying on their own.” ■ Three of the wounded were 10th-grade boys from France who were on the bridge with other visiting students. The three attended St.-Joseph high school in Concarneau, Brittany, according to the French Foreign Ministry. The mother of one of the injured students told the French news media that he had borrowed a friend’s cellphone to text that he was O.K. “His phone didn’t work, but he must have known I would try to reach him because I immediately got a text message from him,” the mother, Isabelle Calvez, said on French television. “He told me he was O.K., but had the incident happened 20 seconds later, he would’ve been hit by the car.” She added that two of the other students had fractured arms and legs, while another had a neck injury. On Thursday, the French Education Ministry said that the injured students from Brittany had been treated and that their conditions were no longer life-threatening. Juliette Meadel, the government minister for victims’ affairs, told CNEWS that the three students were among a group of 56 that went to a nearby hostel after the attack. A second group from the high school, with 36 students, was in another location in London when the attack occurred. Ms. Meadel said the uninjured students would return to France on Thursday. There are more than 4,200 students in London on school trips from France, according to the Education Ministry. Most of the other planned school trips to London on Thursday or Friday have been postponed. Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve of France expressed solidarity with “our British friends” hurt in the attack and offered “full support to the injured French pupils, their families and their classmates.” ■ Five South Koreans were among the 29 people hospitalized. They were wounded when they were mobbed by a crowd fleeing the attack site, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. Four of them — three women and a man in their 50s and 60s — sustained fractures and other injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. A 67-year-old woman, however, suffered a head injury when she was pushed by the fleeing crowd, according to South Korean news reports. She later had surgery to treat her injuries. ■ The two Romanian victims, Andrei Burnaz, 32, and Andreea Cristea, 31, are from the Black Sea port city of Constanta, according to the Romanian news agency Mediafax, which quoted an official as saying they were in London to celebrate Mr. Burnaz’s birthday. Ms. Cristea went into the Thames off Westminster Bridge when the assailant drove through the crowd, and news reports said she suffered serious head injuries and lung damage. She was rescued, and Mr. Burnaz’s foot was fractured. ■ At least three of those injured after being “driven at by a vehicle” were members of the police force, and were in stable condition. ■ A woman described as “an Australian permanent resident” was among the wounded, according to that nation’s government. Australian news outlets reported that the assailant’s vehicle had run over her foot on the bridge. The woman, originally from Germany, lives in South Australia, according to an Australian news report. ■ Two Greeks were hospitalized for minor injuries, according to Alexis Georgiades, the press counselor at the Greek Embassy in London. Hannah Olivennes and Ceylan Yeginsu reported from London, and Gerry Mullany from Hong Kong.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/westminster-terror-attack-front-pages-i-changes-front-on-taste-grounds-standard-publishes-late-edition/","text":"Westminster terror attack front pages: i changes front after backlash Share this The i newspaper changed its front page last night after a backlash when it was published online. The original front showed a pool of blood next to the foot of a victim of yesterday’s terror attack in Westminster. Many voiced concern that it was in poor taste and disrespectful to the apparently deceased man. i editor Oly Duff made the decision to change the front shortly after 10pm saying on Twitter: “Thanks for views on front – there seem to be people with strongly opposing feelings about it, but ultimately cover should not be the story..” He later said: “Thanks for the various messages this evening – especially those criticising first front page for poor taste. No intention to offend… “Understand why it did, and apologise. New cover here. Chastened – and grateful for protection we all receive as go about our daily lives.” The second choice for front page image showed Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood attempting to save the life of the policeman killed by yesterday’s attacker. No related posts. The Evening Standard, which normally now has one edition going to press at 11am, published a late digital version of the paper with the headline “TERRROR CARNAGE AT WESTMINSTER”. The scale of the attack unfolded from 3pm onwards. Press Gazette understands that the Standard has not had the capacity to bring out a 4pm print edition for eight years. The Daily Mail, Mirror, Telegraph, Star and Sun all led with pictures of the attacker (who was killed by police) being carried into an ambulance. The Times gave its entire front-page to an image of police dealing with the aftermath of the attack outside Parliament. The same image, but with a closer crop, was used on several other front pages: Don’t understand this. Why is the image of a shoe and blood lacking in taste? I’d have thought the picture of the victim with his chest bare was much more intrusive and the one of the armed policeman training his gun on the attacker is more violent.

{"originalUrl":"https://sputniknews.com/europe/201703241051917088-britain-terrorists-attack-daesh-security/","text":"Westminster Attack: European Special Forces 'Are Losing Fight With Terrorists' The terror attacks that have occurred in France, Germany and Britain in the past twelve months indicate that the special services of EU countries are losing the fight against terrorism, Sergey Goncharov, head of the Alpha Anti-Terrorist Unit's International Association of Veterans, told Sputnik. In an interview with Sputnik, Sergey Goncharov, head of the Alpha Anti-Terrorist Unit's International Association of Veterans, referred to the terror attacks that have taken place in France, Germany and Britain in the last past twelve months which he said confirm European special services' inability to effectively contain terrorists. The interview came after Reuters reported that the Daesh (ISIL/ISIS/Islamic State) terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the deadly Westminster attack in the British capital earlier this week. On Wednesday, four people were killed and many others injured after a vehicle drove into a crowd on London's Westminster Bridge near the UK Parliament building. The terrorist was later shot by police after he stabbed an officer inside the Parliament compound. Flowers are laid at the scene after an attack on Westminster Bridge in London, Britain, March 22, 2017. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that a British-born man inspired by Islamist ideology, who had been previously investigated by MI-5, was responsible for the attack. \"The threats earlier posed by Islamic State are now starting to be implemented, especially after their actual defeat in Syria. The chain of similar terrorist acts in the largest countries of Europe, such as France, Germany and the UK, indicates that this process is in progress and aimed at intimidating people,\" Goncharov said. On July 14, 2016, a truck rammed into a large crowd that was celebrating Bastille Day in Nice. At least 86 people, including children, were killed and over 400 people were injured. The driver was shot dead by police. According to identification documents found inside the truck, the driver was a 31-year-old male resident of Nice of Tunisian origin. Daesh claimed responsibility for the attack. On December 19, Anis Amri, a 24-year-old asylum seeker from Tunisia, drove a heavy truck into a crowd at the Christmas market on the Breitscheidplatz square in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring almost 50 others. A few days later, Amri was shot by police in Milan, Italy. \"It is safe to say that that the European special services are still yielding to terrorists despite the fact that the top terror threat level is still in place in Germany, France and the UK. In this vein, one should ask the special services of these countries why the necessary security measures failed to work,\" Goncharov said. He stressed that it is almost impossible to fight lone-wolf terrorists. \"While obtaining information about a group of terrorists is a task that can be fulfilled, tracking a lone-wolf terrorist or a mentally ill person who can wait and see for a long time is a tricky problem,\" he said. At the same time, Goncharov said that he does not see the fact that the unarmed policeman was the first to stand in the way of the terrorist in London as an indication of a security breach. \"Any protection of a government building is carried out both by armed officers and unarmed employees who conduct visual surveillance; after all, the terrorist was finally killed by armed police officers,\" he added. Goncharov stressed that it is impossible to provide full-fledged protection from terrorists by \"installing concrete obstacles unthinkable fences everywhere.\" According to him, special services of different EU countries should really unite in the fight against terrorism, but the current political situation in the EU prevents them from \"finding common ground.\" Hello, !

The dead officer was named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father. PM Theresa May said the attack on Wednesday was \"sick and depraved\" and struck at values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech. The attacker has not been named. Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said they think they know who he is and that he was inspired by international and Islamist-related terrorism, but gave no further details. The attack unfolded at about 14.40 GMT on Wednesday when a single attacker drove a grey Hyundai i40 along a pavement over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament in central London, killing three people and injuring many more. The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament. The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed. The attacker was shot dead by armed officers. Mr Rowley paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen.\" Image copyrightMetropolitan PoliceImage caption Keith Palmer had 15 years service with the police \"Heartbroken\" former colleague, Conservative MP James Cleverly, paid tribute to the \"lovely man\" he had known for 25 years. The pair had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer became a policeman. Mrs May said the attack was a \"sick and depraved\" attack on the heart of the capital. Such attempts to defeat UK values were \"doomed to failure\", she said. She paid tribute to the \"exceptional men and women\" of the police force who responded to the attack, saying: \"We will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart.\" The prime minister added: \"The location of this attack was no accident. \"The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.\" She is expected to make a statement in the Commons later. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionLondon attack: Where Westminster attacker struck Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, said it was important to remember that \"this was a story about people who didn't come home yesterday\". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: \"My message to those that want to harm us and destroy our way of life is: You won't succeed; you won't divide us; we won't be cowed by terrorists.\" BBC Newsnight reported there was a suggestion the car used in the attack was hired from an address in Birmingham. However, this has not been confirmed. Armed police carried out a raid on an address in Hagley Road in the city on Wednesday night. A witness told the Press Association: \"They came and arrested three men.\" The BBC understands the Birmingham raid is linked to the London attack. West Midlands Police referred inquires about the operation to Scotland Yard. In latest developments: There will be more armed and unarmed officers on duty in London and across the country as a \"precautionary measure\" The prime minister said the UK terror threat level would remain at severe - its second highest - meaning an attack is \"highly likely\" Home Secretary Amber Rudd urged everyone to remain calm but be vigilant and if they see anything they are concerned about report it to the police People worried about family and friends can call the police casualty bureau on: 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010.

Terrorism looks not just to kill and maim - but to create panic and such a sense of disorder that it rocks a city or nation to its foundations. And this attacker sought to do so in as low-tech way as is possible. The days when terrorism meant large, complex bombs and months of planning are gone: Western security agencies - particularly MI5 and its partner agencies - are very, very good at identifying those plots and disrupting them. The longer it takes to plan such an attack, the more people who are involved, the more chances there will be for security services to learn what is going on.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/724163/salih-khater-charged-attempted-murder-westminster-car-attack-met-police-news","text":"The shop manager, from Birmingham, has today been charged with the attempted murder of members of the public and police officers, the Met Police said in a statement. He will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday, August 20, where prosecutors will be treating his case as terrorism. MET POLICE SECURITY BARRIER: Police have released an image of the silver Fiesta outside parliament The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: \"Salih Khater of Highgate Street, Birmingham, a Sudanese born UK national, will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday, 20 August, charged with the attempted murder of members of the public and the attempted murder of police officers. \"The charges follow an incident in which Khater drove his car into a stationary group of members of the public then at police officers, before crashing into the barriers outside the House of Parliament. \"Due to the methodology, iconic location and the alleged targeting of civilians and police officers, the CPS are treating this case as terrorism.\" “Salih Khater will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court” Met Police Khater remains in custody after Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday granted the force a warrant to detain him until Monday. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terror head Neil Basu earlier said Khater was not co-operating, while the priority of the investigation team continues to be to understand the motivation. Mr Basu said the force is treating it as a terrorist incident because of its apparently deliberate nature, the method used and the \"iconic\" location. The Met said officers have concluded searches at two addresses in Birmingham and one in Nottingham, and continue to search a third in Birmingham. Salih Khater's now-disabled Facebook says he lives in Birmingham, works as a shop manager, and has studied at Sudan University of Science and Technology. BBC WESTMINSTER: The Ford Fiesta hit pedestrians and cyclists before crashing into a barrier The Fiesta used in the alleged attack was driven from Birmingham to London late on Monday and spent almost five hours in the Tottenham Court Road area. It then roved around Westminster for more than 90 minutes before crashing into the barrier just before 7.40am on Tuesday. Footage aired on BBC News showed the car's approach towards Parliament, where it crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with cyclists before entering a small road and crashing into a security barrier. Three people sustained non life-threatening injuries.

The London Mayor said counter-terror experts have told him there has been a shift in the threat, rather than a spike in attacks, this year. There have been five attacks in Britain this year but police have thwarted more potential attacks over the same period of time. In March five people died when Khalid Masood drove at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in central London before stabbing policeman Keith Palmer to death in the grounds of the Palace of Westminster. Between June 2013 and the Westminster attack, 13 attacks were thwarted. Mr Khan told a Guardian live fringe event at Labour's party conference in Brighton: \"The phrase used by police experts, counter-terror experts, in relation to terrorism is what we're seeing is not a spike but a shift. \"And the reason why they say that is because if you look at the time when Fusilier Lee Rigby was murdered in 2013 up until the Westminster Bridge attack this year, there were 13 terrorist attacks thwarted because of the excellent work of the police and security services. \"If you look at the time between March of this year and now, yes there have been four terrorist attacks (in London) but there have been seven that have been thwarted.\" The figure is one more than the number previously released. Earlier this month, senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, Neil Basu, said six plots had been stopped since March.","title":"Seven terror plots foiled in six months, Sadiq Khan

A spokesman for the Port of London Authority, which looks after safety on the River Thames, said: \"A female member of the public was recovered from the water near Westminster Bridge. She is alive but undergoing urgent medical treatment on a nearby pier. He said the river has been closed from Vauxhall to Embankment \"as part of the security response\". The woman was rescued at 2.49pm \"She was recovered alive but injured,\" a spokesman said. \"She needed urgent medical attention. We have closed the river. The only person in the river we are aware if following the incident in this female.\" Police officers said they had received a number of calls about a person being seen in the water. Steve Voake, 55, was walking across the Westminster Bridge towards the South Bank when he saw the aftermath. He said that he had seen a person in the water, as well as at least two bodies lying on the road and one in the water. \"I saw a trainer lying in the road and when I looked more closely I saw that

One of her classmates asked her where she was the night before but she knew she was joking so she laughed it off. The girl says she felt almost guilty over the attack.

I was scared that maybe I would be assaulted because of the many labels that come with wearing a hijab.” “It's scary being a Muslim as these horrible acts of terror are happening and I hope that I can still live here 50 years down the line, and that my future children will get so see the beauty of London and the amazing people who live here.” Several people have commented on the post with messages of support. Photo: Reddit/CRLXZZZ The post has been met with support for the girl with one Reddit user commenting “genuinely heartbreaking”. Another person said they are a Muslim and in the same situation. “We must learn lessons from our religion and realise that by definition as Muslims we will always be struggling with this life one way or another – the solution is in our religion,” the person said.","title":"'We may be Muslim, but we don't want to hurt you': A London schoolgirl's heartfelt

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/this-is-the-man-behind-the-westminster-attack?utm_term=.wjMYKGYpYR#.wjMYKGYpYR","text":"Khalid Masood, the man who attacked parliament this week, was born Adrian Elms in Dartford, Kent, on Christmas Day in 1964. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. Masood had been investigated “some years ago” as part of an investigation into violent extremism, prime minister Theresa May told MPs on Thursday. But despite a history of violent criminal offences he was only ever seen as \"peripheral\" in historical terror investigations. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. A former intelligence official told BuzzFeed News: \"The service had him as an SOI [subject of interest] a few years ago but think he didn't meet the threshold for investigation so was not investigated further.\" They added: \"My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he's acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint.\" Metropolitan police Khalid Masood The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \"Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.” Masood’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. In 2000, while living in the village of Northiam, Sussex, Masood, still known then as Elms, was convicted for slashing a man’s face after an argument in a pub. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott. This was a long time ago. I remember Elms being a bit of a troubled character.” Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News The block of flats where Masood lived most recently in Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham. A next-door neighbour who gave her name as Iwona, 45, said he had lived there for seven months. \"I am really surprised, I cannot believe it, I cannot believe it,” she told BuzzFeed News. “As I said, when I saw him I couldn't even think someone could do something like this. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. “Sometimes in the afternoon I saw him taking care of the garden, washing the car, and he was very calm.\" Iwona described the woman he lived with there as being in her thirties and said she wore \"Islamic clothing\". The neighbour said she hadn't seen Masood for a few months and that he just \"took a van and went\". Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. \"The family moved quickly and took their things out of the garage,\" Iwona said. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News Masood's neighbour Iwona at her flat in Quayside, Birmingham. Another neighbour, who gave her name as Sam, said: “He moved out in December and I never really spoke to him. I didn't know his name before. “He had a little boy who was 5 years old. There was a woman – I didn't know if it was his wife or daughter. We’d just say hello in the street.” It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Department for Education said Masood never held qualified status as a teacher, but according to The Sun newspaper he claimed on his CV to have an economics degree and to be a “senior English teacher” at a TEFL college in Luton in 2009. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, the prime minister confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”. Echoing police, she said the “working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology”. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. “He was just like any other guest who checks into the hotel,\" he said. \"We had a brief conversation about where he came from in Birmingham. “He talked about his family, his mum, his dad, his wife. He said his dad was ill and his mum was upset.” Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. Huntleys School website “I am really, really shocked. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. The picture of us in the football team was after we did a 24-hour sponsored football match to raise money for the sports hall,” said Stuart Knight, who went to school with Masood, to TheGuardian. “We would have been about 14 years old. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

May was emotional too in her response. Matt Dathan (@matt_dathan) James Cleverly sheds tears as he pays tribute to Keith Palmer, who he served alongside. Says he was a \"strong, professional public servant\" pic.twitter.com/HhP2n5sMDV Theresa May's statement - Summary MPs from all sides of the Commons have been praising Theresa May for the tone and the language she used in her statement to the Commons about the Westminster terror attack. It is routine for prime ministers to respond to terrorist killings by saying that democracy will prevail, but May delivered that message this morning with great dignity and sincerity. Here are the key points. May said that attacker was a British-born man who had been investigated in the past in relation to violent extremism, by only as “a peripheral figure”. But he had not been a current suspect, she said. His identity is known to the police and MI5, and when operational considerations allow, he will be publicly identified. What I can confirm is that the man was British born and that – some years ago – he was once investigated by M15 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture. (The text issued by Number 10 says the attacker was “once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism” but in the chamber May said he was “once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism.”) She said the attackerwas thought to have acted alone and that the police “have no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public”. She said the “working assumption” was that the attacker was “inspired by Islamist ideology”. She gave details of the nationalities of those injured on Westminster Bridge. Two people were killed and about 40 more were injured, she said: In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know that the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. She said the police would increase the number of patrols in cities “as a precautionary measure”. She described the attack as “an attack on free people everywhere”. She said the “best response to terrorism” was for people to carry with their lives as normal. It is in these actions – millions of acts of normality – that we find the best response to terrorism. A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in. A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price. A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us. One of the Edge Hill University students who was struck by the terrorist’s 4x4 has this morning thanked the emergency services. Owen Lambert, 18, was on Westminster Bridge when the vehicle ploughed into pedestrians, killing two and leaving dozens more injured. Owen, who received stitches for a head wound, said on Thursday: “Battered and bruised but doing fine, massive thanks to Metropolitan police and the Chelsea and Westminster hospital for helping me through this ordeal and an even bigger thanks to all my family and friends for supporting me every step of the way.” His fellow student, Travis Frain, suffered a cracked rib plus hand and arm injuries. His mother, Angela Frain, said last night that he was “OK” and in “good spirits”. He is expected to remain in hospital for several days. Travis Frain, 19, who was injured in the Westminster terror attack went over the bonnet of the killer’s car as the carnage began, his mother said today. Photograph: Family Handout/PA Responding to Corbyn, May paid tribute both to the support received from France and to the bravery of the police. She said France too had “felt the horror and trauma of terrible terrorist attacks.” Police officers like Keith Palmer put their lives on the line every day, she said. Every day, when they put on that uniform, they don’t know what they are going to confront in the course of their duties that day. It’s a fact often forgotten when people see the police officer walking on the streets that actually they do put their lives on the line for our safety and security. They show enormous bravery and we are grateful to them all. Here is the statement from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, where he called the attack “an appalling atrocity” but urged people not to rush to judgment. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn responds after Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to MPs in the House of Commons in the aftermath of yesterday’s terror attack on the Palace of Westminster. Photograph: PA What happened yesterday was an appalling atrocity. Today, we are united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity. I express my condolences to the family and friends of PC Keith Palmer, who gave his life yesterday in defence of the public and our democracy – and to the loved ones of those still in a critical condition including the French schoolchildren visiting our capital from Concarneau in Brittany. The injured include people of ten nationalities. Innocent people were killed yesterday walking across Westminster Bridge as many millions of Londoners and tourists have done before them. I thank all the dedicated NHS staff working to save lives, including those from St Thomas’ Hospital who rushed out to help those in need. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. It behoves us all not to rush to judgement, but to wait for the police to establish the facts. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred. Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader, praised the prime minister for her statement. Today of all days we are reminded that, notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues, we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none. Does she agree with me that no terrorist outrage is representative of any faith or faith community and we recommit ourselves to strengthening the bonds of tolerance and understanding? In the days to come I hope we will remember the love and bravery of the victim, not just the hatred and cowardice of the attackers. Theresa May's statement - further key extracts Mr Speaker, in terms of security here in Westminster, we should be clear first of all that an attacker attempted to break into Parliament and was shot dead within twenty yards of the gates. If his intention was to gain access to this building, we should be clear that he did not succeed.The police heroically did their job. But as is routine, the police together with the House authorities are reviewing the security of the Parliamentary estate, co-ordinated with the Cabinet Office, who have responsibility for the security measures in place around the Government secure zone. All of us in this House have a responsibility for the security and safety of our staff and advice is available for Members who need it. Mr Speaker, yesterday we saw the worst of humanity, but we will remember the best. We will remember the extraordinary efforts to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, including those by my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Bournemouth East. And we will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way ... Mr Speaker, a lot has been said since terror struck London yesterday. Much more will be said in the coming days. But the greatest response lies not in the words of politicians, but in the everyday actions of ordinary people. For beyond these walls today – in scenes repeated in towns and cities across the country –millions of people are going about their days and getting on with their lives. The streets are as busy as ever. The offices full. The coffee shops and cafes bustling. As I speak millions will be boarding trains and aeroplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth. It is in these actions – millions of acts of normality – that we find the best response to terrorism. A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in. A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price. A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us. Mr Speaker, let this be the message from this House and this nation today: our values will prevail. And I commend this statement to the House. Theresa May's statement – key extracts Rowena Mason Here are key extracts from Theresa May’s statement. Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy. But today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face ofterrorism. And we meet here in the oldest of all parliaments because we know democracy and the values it entails will always prevail. Those values free speech, liberty, human rights and rule of law are embodied here in this place and shared by free people around the world. A terrorist came to the place where people of all nationalities and culture gather to celebrate what it means to be free. He took out his rage indiscriminately on men, women and children. This was an attack on free people everywhere and on behalf of the British people I would like to thank our friends and allies around the world who have made it clear they stand with us. What happened on the streets of Westminster sickened us all. While there is an ongoing police investigation, the House will understand there are limits to what I can say but having been updated by police and security officials let me set out what at this stage I can tell the house. At approximately 2.40pm yesterday a single attacker drove his vehicle at speed into innocent pedestrians crossing Westminster Bridge, killing two people and injuring around 40 more. In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. We are in close contacts with the governments of the countries of all those affected. The injured also included three police officers returning from an event to recognise their bravery ... Two of those three remain in a serious condition. The attacker then left the vehicle and approached a police officer at Carriage Gates, attacking that officer with a large knife before he was shot dead by an armed police officer. Tragically 48 year old PC Keith Palmer was killed. He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten. I can confirm police have searched six addresses and made eight arrests in Birmingham and London. It is still believed this attacker acted alone and police have no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public. His identity is known to the police and MI5. When operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. What I can confirm is the man was British born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He is not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or the plot. Intensive investigations continue … Our working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology. We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real. But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not and will not be cowed by this threat. We are stepping up policing to reassure the public and as a precautionary measure it will mean increasing patrols in cities across the country, with more police and more armed police on the streets.","title":"Westminster attack: 75-year-old man becomes fourth victim – as it happened | UK news | The

{"originalUrl":"http://a.msn.com/01/en-gb/BByD5Xn?ocid=st","text":"Popular Videos The Serjeant-at-Arms arrived with the mace. There were the usual prayers, then a minute’s silence then the business of the house, albeit not quite as usual. One by one they rose to say the same, noble thing. To speak of our “values”, to praise a man killed in the “service of his country”. Killed “protecting parliament”, “protecting parliamentary democracy”. Many members sat with their faces set in masks of defiance, diligently nodding along with every repeated sentiment, of how our values will “long outlast theirs”, and quite right too. But one man’s face was not defiant. James Cleverly stared straight ahead as if in a trance. His lower lip curled upward. His entire countenance pointed toward the floor. An army major, and an MP since 2015, he sat behind the Prime Minister as she praised PC Keith Palmer, a man she called “every inch a hero”. But when he rose to speak, James Cleverly did not speak of a hero, but of a mate. “With your indulgence sir, I’d like to turn to PC Keith Palmer,” he said. “Who I first met as Gunner Keith Palmer, twenty five years ago, at Headquarters Battery, 100 Regiment, Artillery. He was a strong, professional, public servant.” It was then that his voice cracked. “It was a delight to meet him again, a few months after being elected.” There was an inescapable sense that he had more to say, but knew the words would not come. He asked the Prime Minister to consider a “posthumous recognition of the work he did”, and returned to his seat. She said she would do so. Read more They queued up to call it business as usual. One read out a picture circulating online, a mockup of a London Underground sign “politely” telling terrorists that “this is London and we will drink tea and jolly well carry on as usual”. But it’s not business as usual. Not really. Tobias Ellwood, the member for Bournemouth East, who spent yesterday afternoon on his knees beneath Big Ben seeking to revive PC Palmer, stood upright by the entrance way. Each time his “heroics” were praised he glanced at his feet. A hero perhaps, and yes, he has arrived at work the next day to carry on as normal. But he knows the paramedics who worked with him, trying to save a life are off elsewhere this morning, trying to save someone else’s. Where they worked there is a blue tent. Workers in white forensic suits are gathering evidence. But that is not to doubt the defiance. When the Serjeant-at-Arms arrives at the end of the day to take the mace away again, the final item on the order paper, the last subject to have been discussed in the oldest parliament in the world? The Ratty’s Lane Incinerator at Hoddesdon. As fitting a tribute as any. The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.","title":"PC Keith Palmer: MPs make moving tributes in Commons to policeman

{"originalUrl":"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/789861/Keith-Palmer-death-funeral-Westminster-London-terror-attack-victims","text":"THE funeral for PC Keith Palmer has seen thousands of mourners line the streets of London to pay their respects to the hero who was stabbed to death in the London terror attack. The funeral service was led by the Dean of Southwark The Very Reverend Andrew Nunn and is being followed by a private cremation. The Met's senior chaplain, the Reverend Prebendary Jonathan Osborne, led the prayers and Chief Insp Neil Sawyer, who worked with PC Palmer in Bromley and the Territorial Support Group, paid warm tribute to his colleague. Hymns including I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say were followed by a rendition of The Last Post by a bugler from the Honourable Artillery Company. Officers bowed their heads as the Last Post sounded from the cathedral shortly after a recital of the Lord's Prayer. A few moments' silence then followed a rendition of God Save The Queen, as on-duty officers, medical staff and members of the public stood still in respect for PC Palmer. Around 50 members of PC Palmer's family including his wife, child, mother and father, brother and sisters are attended the service. A floral tribute left on top of the hearse read: \"No 1 daddy\". The cortege was led by the Metropolitan Police Colour Party and a \"Black Guard\" of mounted officers. PC Palmer's coffin travelled 2.6 miles along some of the capital's usually bustling streets - but avoiding the scene of last month's atrocity on Westminster Bridge - to arrive for the 2pm

{"originalUrl":"http://dannyuk.com/2017/04/19/london-is-open-westminster-terror-attack/","text":"London is open, despite the Westminster terror attack London is open, despite the Westminster terror attack We’d had our small weekend stay in London planned for a few weeks. The phrase “London is open” was trending, launched by the Mayor of London to show that our capital was still strong in the face of leaving the EU. Growing up on the border of south-east London, I’m used to the hustle, bustle and trouble brought about in our capital city. But three days before we were due to visit the capital, the Westminster terrorist attack happened. As a result, the meaning behind “London is Open” seemed to evolve. I love London. I always have. Even after four decades on the planet, spending quality time in London is still guaranteed to put a smile on my face. Mrs DannyUK is a born-and-bred Scouser. Well, she is in my eyes. A closer look at her birth certificate would prove otherwise. Having a quick conversation with the lady in my life would reveal that she is, in fact, born and bred on the Wirral. I don’t know what the collective term for people from the Wirral is, though. Wirralites? What’s a small stretch of water when we’re writing a blog post, though? MrsDannyUK and my stepdaughter entranced by the view from The Shard on our visit. Westminster terror attack I’ve no doubt that the Westminster terror attack in the heart of London just a few days before had spooked her, though. Possibly not as much as I’d guess it had shaken her mum who I’m sure was worried about her daughter and granddaughter making their way down to somewhere that seems so dangerous now. I can only speak for myself, though. Being born in the 70s, I grew up in the 80s and was visiting London with friends in the early 90s. I even started work in the city at the tender age of 16. I remember the Bishopsgate bomb. More than that, I remember the constant threat of IRA attacks. I’ve lived through terrorism, peace treaties and also have seen the former shatter the latter. Is London a dangerous place to be? No. Of course not. It’s no more dangerous today than it was last week, last year or last millennium. In fact, with the sheer focus being brought to the capital and the increased police presence it’s probably safer now than it normally is. Either way, life goes on. That’s not meant to be harsh or ignorant of those who have suffered. It’s fact. With the hashtag #LondonIsOpen trending following the attacks, it seems that the fighting spirit and the carry-on-as-normal attitude is the norm. There will always be threats. Whether it’s on an individual level or at an international level. We can’t live in fear. And as I finish this blog post - a few weeks after the tragedy - it seems that life carried on as it should do for the majority. We’ve mourned the dead, we’ve celebrated their lives but the biggest tribute is that London was always open.","title":"London is open, despite the Westminster terror attack -

Pc Keith Palmer, who was stabbed to death when he confronted attacker Khalid Masood outside the Houses of Parliament last March, was named the winner of the outstanding bravery of the year prize at the Met Police Excellence Awards. On the day of the attack on March 22, Pc Palmer, a husband and father, was on duty at the Palace of Westminster. The 48-year-old officer came face to face with Masood, who was armed with two large knives, moments after the terrorist drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Intent on protecting his colleagues and the public, Pc Palmer confronted the 52-year-old attacker despite the danger he faced. Video: How the Westminster attack unfolded The policeman was fatally wounded during the incident, which came to a close when Masood was shot dead by armed officers. Pc Palmer had served on the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Group since 2016 and had been with the Met for 16 years. It is not the first honour for Pc Palmer, as last year it was announced that he was to be awarded a George Medal in the Queen's civilian gallantry list. Four other people were killed in the Westminster attack. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood was also honoured at the ceremony, being given an outstanding contribution award for his efforts in rushing to help Pc Palmer. Mr Ellwood, a former soldier, tried in vain to save the officer, giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and applying pressure to staunch the flow of blood from his wounds.","title":"Pc Keith Palmer

{"originalUrl":"https://eldiamantedig.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/terror-attack-in-westminster-kills-four-and-injures-many","text":"Post navigation Terror Attack in Westminster Kills Four and Injures Many On Wednesday, March 22, 2017, on the Westminster Bridge in London, UK, an unnamed man used his car as a weapon as he ran over several people. After he got out of his car, he stabbed a police officer before he was shot and killed. So far, four people have died, and twenty others are severely injured. The area around the attack, which includes the Parliament, immediately went on lockdown. Civilians were ushered into the viewing compartments of the famous London Eye. It is being treated as a terrorist attack until further details are uncovered. The attacker was uncovered and his name is Khalid Masood and he has been in communication with violent extremists.

The House of Commons will sit this morning, with prime ministerTheresa May saying the country would not be cowed: Parliament will meet as normal. We will come together as normal. And Londoners – and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great city – will get up and go about their day as normal. They will board their trains, they will leave their hotels, they will walk these streets, they will live their lives. And we will all move forward together. Never giving in to terror. And never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart. London is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. UK foreign minister Boris Johnson, who is in the US for an international meeting discussing the Isis threat, said: Heartbreaking. This is not the first attack on London or our Parliament - and won’t be the last - but our values will prevail. The terror threat level for the UK remains unchanged, at “severe”. The Metropolitan police said extra patrols, armed and unarmed, would be in place, “particularly in crowded places and iconic locations”. The Queen has postponed a planned visit to Scotland Yard that was due to take place today. A terrorist attack has occurred in the United Kingdom. I offer my deepest condolences to the victims and extend my sympathy to all those who were wounded. Terrorism is absolutely intolerable. Japan stands in solidarity with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, as well as with its people during this difficult time. Prime Minister May has conveyed the message that the United Kingdom is firm in the fight against terrorism. Japan offers its full support to Prime Minister May and will combat terrorism in cooperation with the international community. The attack outside the Houses of Parliament in London is the latest in a series of terrorist atrocities involving a vehicle being driven at speed into pedestrians – a tactic actively promoted by Islamic State. “If you are not able to find a bomb or a bullet, then smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,” he said. Though al-Adnani, who was killed in 2016, pointed a finger specifically at France, where there were two vehicle attacks in 2014, he also cited the UK among preferred targets. • This section of the live blog was amended on 23 March 2017 to clarify a reference to the Berlin truck attacker. Comedian and actor Margaret Cabourn-Smith characterised this tenor of the response, tweeting: “#WeAreNotAfraid Or rather I am; but I’m damned if I’m going to let that stop me doing anything differently. Malcolm Turnbull and Australian Labor leader Bill Shorten are offering condolences to the UK in the Canberra parliament now, with the British High Commissioner Menna Rawlings looking on. Turnbull said: As prime minister Theresa May said earlier this morning, the values of the British parliament command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. And so they do because they are our values too. We stand, all of us, with the UK. Comforted that we share those values. They’re ours. Freedom of speech, democracy, the rule of law. We will never give in to terror. He said of British MP Tobias Ellwood, who assisted attempts to resuscitate the police officer, PC Keith Palmer, who was fatally stabbed: This act of heroism is just one of the extraordinary stories that are emerging from this tragedy. Shorten paid tribute to Palmer: The murder of the Metropolitan police officer reminds us of the risks our security agencies take on our behalf to keep us safe. And on behalf of all honourable members I want to acknowledge and thank our Australian federal police and the parliamentary security officers for whom this news must strike a particular chord. Thursday’s Guardian editorial calls for solidarity in the wake of the terror attack on Westminster and pays tribute to the officers who intervened: The security forces and police have planned for what they call a “marauding attack” for years. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace. There will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates, but for now, there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job.

{"originalUrl":"http://news.sky.com/story/french-police-officer-killed-by-gunman-in-paris-terror-attack-10844372","text":"A property being searched in the eastern Paris suburb of Chelles is understood to be his home and three members of his family have been taken into custody. Anti-terrorism prosecutor Francois Molins said that a note had apparently fallen out of Cheurfi's pocket that defended the Islamic State. Mr Molins said Cheurfi had a long criminal record, including trying to attack police previously. He added that Cheurfi had been arrested in February but released due to lack of evidence. French officials, speaking anonymously, said the suspect had been convicted of attempted murder after firing on two plainclothes police in 2001. While in jail, he also shot and wounded a prison officer after grabbing his gun. Image:A picture of shooting suspect Karim Cheurfi from social media Image:Xavier Jugele, 37, was killed in the attack The policeman he killed has been named as 37-year-old Xavier Jugele, by Flag!, a French LGBT police officers' association. He was one of the officers who responded to the attack on the Bataclan during the Paris attacks in November 2015. As the country prepares to vote, France's prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said more than 50,000 police and gendarmes, as well as 7,000 soldiers, had been mobilised to safeguard the electionand protect polling stations. \"Nothing must hamper this democratic moment, essential for our country,\" said Mr Cazeneuve. 1:48 Video:Family say they were 10ft from the gunman Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen used the aftermath of the attack to call for the government to immediately expel foreigners being monitored by intelligence services and to reinstate France's borders. Conservative candidate Francois Fillon said the fight against \"Islamist totalitarianism\" should be the priority for France's next president. Image:Police have been searching a house where the attacker is believed to have lived Image:Armed police were on patrol again on Friday on the Champs-Elysees \"We are at war, there is no alternative, it's us or them,\" said Mr Fillon. In a video posted online, frontrunner for the presidency Emmanuel Macron said \"the terrorists will is to destabilise the country\". \"In such circumstances, the role of the president of the Republic as the army chief and guardian of our institutions is to protect the French. I am ready,\" he said. Image:The public were ushered away from the scene as police drew their weapons Matthias Fekl, the French interior minister, paid tribute to the dead policeman and praised his colleagues who he said had \"prevented a bloodbath\".

At least five people are dead and 20 injured following a terrorist incident in London. What had been dreaded finally happened – an attack on UK soil which brought to mind recent tragedies on mainland Europe. Police are conducting a “major terrorist investigation”. It appears that a car was driven at speed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, which is just in front of the Palace of Westminster – home to the UK parliament. At least two people have died as a result of being injured by the car. The driver then reportedly ran the few metres to the parliament complex and attacked a police officer with a knife before being shot by another officer. The police later confirmed that the stabbed officer was among the dead, as well as the suspected attacker. Parliamentarians were quickly put into lockdown and the prime minister was driven away at speed. The area around Westminster – including Whitehall, where many government departments are based – was shut off. The rapidity with which the authorities reacted proves that London, though horrified by what has happened, was ready for such an event. MPs were kept shut in the House of Commons as the incident unfolded outside.PA The devastation that can be caused when ordinary vehicles are used as weapons on soft targets such as civilian areas has been all too clear in recent years. With so many killed in Nice in July 2016 and Berlin in December 2016 by men driving lorries into crowds, there has been mounting concern about how to protect public spaces. On this occasion it appeared to be a car that was used, but the driver was still able to inflict serious injury on passers by. The terror effect The Metropolitan Police have been preparing for such an incident in London at least since Daesh (IS) struck in Paris in November 2015. And planning has realistically been in the works since long before that. London suffered its last large-scale terrorist attack in 2005, but several smaller scale incidents have occurred since and many more plots foiled. The UK has been on “severe alert” since 2014, meaning an attack is highly likely. Preparations for attacks have included a series of exercises to test responses and effectiveness in dealing with an incident. Just days before the Westminster attack, armed police were out on the river Thames carrying out a large-scale hostage simulation involving a ferry and dozens of actors. Police lock down the area around parliament.EPA/Andy Rain London has long been recognised as a primary target for a terrorist attack, with certain parts of Westminster and the City of London seen as particularly high risk. The capital experienced numerous IRA attacks during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, including a bomb at the Houses of Parliament in 1974 and the killing of Airey Nevey, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, who died after his car was blown up as he drove out of a car park beneath parliament’s New Palace Yard. Government minister Tobias Ellwood attempted to resuscitate the stabbed policeman.PA The city’s approach to managing the terrorist threat has evolved along the way. These days, physical barriers can be seen at strategic locations all over London. The palace of Westminster itself is surrounded by large black barriers, which make approaching the complex in a vehicle difficult. Police officers are deployed at strategic locations and their numbers have been increased lately. They are on the ground to provide a rapid response to attack and appear to have done exactly that in this case. While the horror of what has happened can’t be denied, the response was incredibly rapid. The suspect was tackled extremely quickly and the area locked down at great speed. This incident shows why the threat level in the UK has been rated as “severe” for some time now – meaning that an attack is highly likely but that there are no details about how, when or where the attack might take place. Details are still emerging but most are in agreement that the police reaction was rapid and worthy of high praise.","title":"Terrorism in Westminster: London had expected attack for some time and

{"originalUrl":"http://www.emenikesblog.com/2017/03/london-terrorist-attack-five-dead-in.html","text":"Thursday, 23 March 2017 London Terrorist Attack: Five dead in Westminster terror attack The attack unfolded at about 14.40 GMT on Wednesday when a single attacker drove a grey Hyundai i40 along a pavement over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament in central London, killing three people and injuring many more. The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament. The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed. The attacker was shot dead by armed officers. Mr Rowley paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen.\" \"Heartbroken\" former colleague, Conservative MP James Cleverly, paid tribute to the \"lovely man\" he had known for 25 years. The pair had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer became a policeman. The attacker's other victims have not been named yet. One is known to be a woman.[source BBC] Mrs May said the attack was a \"sick and depraved\" attack on the heart of the capital. Such attempts to defeat UK values were \"doomed to failure\", she said. She paid tribute to the \"exceptional men and women\" of the police force who responded to the attack, saying: \"We will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart.\" The prime minister added: \"The location of this attack was no accident. \"The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of

{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/news/382100-westminster-attack-yemen-hypocrisy/","text":"The outpouring of grief and solidarity in the aftermath of the Westminster terrorist attack has provided westerners with some modicum of hope, but such reactions are not universal, with many pointing to the lack of response to attacks elsewhere. While many online praised the bravery of PC Keith Palmer, who sacrificed his own life to save others at the gates of the Houses of Parliament, others highlighted conflict zones around the world that suffer from terrorism on a weekly basis. Everyone is asking \"what can we do to stop terrorist attacks\" the UK has terrorised the middle east for years but ppl seem to forget that?? Several Twitter users questioned the lack of coverage on digital and social media in response to Monday’s car bomb attack attack in Baghdad which killed 23 people and injured many more, bringing into focus the bloody impact of terrorism in the wider world this month alone. In a sad indictment of the modern world, one user simply highlighted both the frequency and severity of attacks that have taken place across the world in recent months, which also overshadowed the dark day in Westminster. Comparisons were also drawn between the terror attack at Westminster and Syria’s long battle with extremists.

{"originalUrl":"http://gu.com/p/66tn6?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Tweet","text":"On the news channels on Thursday, they were switching back and forth between updates on the Westminster attacks and live coverage of the funeral of Martin McGuinness. Often those juxtapositions, those split-screen moments, are jarring. Not this time. For the murder and mayhem unleashed in Westminster and the life of McGuinness were two aspects of a timeless story. They were a reminder of the pain terror inflicts, and the precious fragility of any and every effort to make it stop. McGuinness’s life was so complicated, and the response to his death so fraught, because it encompassed both. The murder and mayhem unleased in Westminster and the life of McGuinness were two aspects of a timeless story Start with the pain, which is never a surprise but strikes afresh with each new outrage. Consider the arbitrariness that can end the life of a man from faraway Utah, in London to celebrate his silver wedding, or a college worker collecting her kids from school or a retired window cleaner off to a visit a friend in hospital. The sense of duty that propels an unarmed policeman towards an attacker carrying a knife. The thought that that policeman’s five-year-old daughter will now grow up without a father, a fact that will shape her life, its impact felt every day, many decades into the future. And meanwhile, over in Derry, images from a church, images that would once have made no sense, at least not under a single roof. There was the coffin, draped in the tricolour of Ireland, containing the body of the former IRA commander in the city. Just a few steps away stood the current leader of the Democratic Unionist party, the successor to the Rev Ian Paisley. The DUP leader was there to pay her respects to the former IRA man. Anyone old enough to remember life on these islands before the 1990s can only feel astonishment at such a sight. These were once mortal enemies, with an emphasis on the mortal. In the 1970s, every year but one saw the number of British deaths caused by terrorism top the 100 mark: in 1972, the figure reached 353. In the 80s and early 90s, the annual death toll hovered between 50 and 100. And almost all of those deaths were in Northern Ireland. Strange to recall it now, but the persistence of this lethal conflict became part of the mental furniture: there, but not something you thought about too often. A bombing or shooting in Belfast was a routine news story. Bomb scares at London railway stations or shops were regular occurrences, an inconvenience to be got around. In the first stage of his life, McGuinness was up to his neck in this misery. His reputation was for clear-eyed, unflinching brutality. “We should not forget how effective he was as the head of a ruthless killing machine,” says Mick Fealty, who runs the much-admired Slugger O’Toole blog. He adds that McGuinness’s acts of violence, for instance targeting Protestant-owned businesses in Derry, drove large parts of that community out of their home town. Given all that, one can hardly blame Norman Tebbit – whose wife was left paralysed by the Brighton bombing of 1984 – for hoping that McGuinness will spend eternity burning in “a particularly hot and unpleasant corner of hell”. But McGuinness then applied that same single-minded, disciplined focus to the task of peacemaking. He was a patient, creative negotiator, who deserves much credit for the Good Friday agreement. In the years since that accord was signed, the UK terrorism annual death toll has hovered close to zero, and there it has remained – with the gruesome exception of 2005, the year of 7/7. And this is what makes McGuinness’s life so complicated to assess. He was a core part of both the problem and the solution. His record of violence was not erased by the shift he made, but our view of it is inevitably altered. When I tweeted praise for his peacemaking efforts, someone replied that they preferred peacemakers who hadn’t first been makers of war. Morally, that has to be right – and yet it cannot be denied that it is those who once wielded swords who make the most effective advocates for ploughshares. In 2002, I found myself in the chair at a two-day private meeting, organised by the Guardian, which brought those who had forged the Good Friday agreement face to face with Israeli and Palestinian leaders longing to resolve their own conflict. The most memorable session came when McGuinness sat alongside the loyalist leader David Ervine. The latter explained that each of them had once been hellbent on killing the other. Now they were determined that their children would grow up with better dreams. They held the room rapt. Much as we might wish it were otherwise, their words had a greater impact than those spoken by the Ulster Unionist or SDLP leaders who had always eschewed violence. The explanation was partly practical: the Israelis and Palestinians around the table knew that no peace between their peoples would ever hold unless it included the men of violence. But something more human was at work too: the sense that, because the likes of Ervine and McGuinness had seen into, even fallen into, the abyss, their determination to pull back from it was especially intense. And, as Bill Clinton captured in a masterful eulogy to McGuinness, we cannot help but be inspired by stories of men who abandon war to pursue peace. It gives us hope. Taken together, this week’s events in Westminster and Derry are a reminder of how necessary, rare and delicate a peace accord is. When you have one, you hold it carefully and with both hands. Yet this basic wisdom seems lost on our current leaders. Before last year’s referendum, plenty of voices warned that Brexit threatened the fragile equilibrium that has prevailed in Northern Ireland for nearly two decades. The genius of the SDLP leader John Hume had been to see that a European dimension could remove much of the sting of the conflict: after all, what need for a hard border separating the Republic and the north when both were in the European Union, trading as partners in a single market? ‘No wonder that Gove and his fellow members of what is still, misleadingly, called the Conservative and Unionist party are ready to yank out a plank from an infinitely complex, frail structure, assembled with such patience two decades ago.’ Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Now all that is to be tipped over. True, the common travel area between north and south exists independent of the EU, and should survive. But even without the construction of a hard border – all barbed wire and “Papers, please” – Brexit, and especially a UK exit from the customs union, destabilises a situation that needs calm above all. Perhaps that’s no surprise. Recall that the arch-Brexiteer Michael Gove was a noisy, inconsolable foe of the peacemakers of Northern Ireland. He authored a denunciation of the Good Friday agreement in 2000, two years after it had been signed. Anticipating Donald Trump, he called the referendum that had overwhelmingly backed it “rigged”. The pamphlet’s third chapter was titled The Case Against ‘The Peace Process’. No wonder, then, that Gove and his fellow members of what is still, misleadingly, called the Conservative and Unionist party are ready to yank out a plank from an infinitely complex, frail structure assembled with such patience two decades ago. Just as they don’t mind risking a Scottish vote that would break up the UK, so they are ready to unravel the ties that have bound Northern Ireland together in peace. Like the rest of us, they have seen again this week the pain that terrorism can cause. They know what has kept the lid on the UK’s most lethal source of that pain – and yet they think nothing of kicking it away. In the onward march to Brexit, there is nothing that gives them pause. This article was amended on 27 March 2017. Martin McGuinness’s funeral took place in a church, not a cathedral, as stated in an earlier version.","title":"With all we know about terror, how can we risk Northern Ireland’s peace? | Jonathan

{"originalUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Westminster_attack","text":"Police treated the attack as \"Islamist-related terrorism\". Masood reportedly said in a final text message that he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries in the Middle East. Amaq News Agency, which is linked to Islamic State, said the attacker answered the group's calls to target citizens of states that are fighting against it, though the claim was questioned by the UK police and government. Police have found no link with a terrorist organisation and believe Masood acted alone.[1] One of the victims, a Romanian tourist, was thrown by the car's impact over the parapet of the bridge into the River Thames below. Having been knocked unconscious and sustained severe injuries from the fall, she was later rescued by the crew of a river cruise and brought aboard a London Fire Brigade boat.[8] She later died in hospital from her injuries.[14] The car continued, and crashed into railings on Bridge Street at the north perimeter of the Palace of Westminster.[15] Despite attempts to resuscitate him, Masood died at the scene from a single gunshot wound to his chest;[19][20][21] he was pronounced dead at 15:35 at hospital.[22] Passers-by, including MP Tobias Ellwood (the Foreign Minister for the Middle East and Africa) and paramedics, attempted to revive PC Palmer, also without success.[23][21] Police later confirmed that PC Palmer had been wearing a protective vest, which did not appear to have been punctured in the attack.[24] Six people, including the attacker, died as a result of the incident, and around 50 others were injured, some of them severely. Of the five people killed by the attacker, three were British nationals.[13][17] Aysha Frade, a British teacher, believed to have been walking along the bridge to pick up her children from school, was struck by the attacker's car and killed.[40] A tourist from the United States, Kurt Cochran, was also hit by the car and died.[17] Cochran was visiting London from Utah to celebrate his 25th anniversary with his wife Melissa, who was among the injured.[41] The police officer killed was PC Keith Palmer, 48, an unarmed police officer who was on duty with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection command.[42][43] Palmer had 15 years of experience in the Metropolitan Police Service.[20] The fourth victim was Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Clapham in south-west London, who was hit by the car and later died in hospital after his life support was switched off.[44][45] A fifth victim, Andreea Cristea, a 31-year-old tourist from Romania, fell into the Thames during the attack; she died in hospital as a result of her injuries on 6 April after her life support was withdrawn. Her Romanian boyfriend, who had planned to propose marriage during their trip to London, was also injured during the attack.[46][33] The attacker was identified by the Metropolitan Police as 52-year-old Briton Khalid Masood.[48] He was born Adrian Russell Elms, but later changed the name to Adrian Russell Ajao when he took the name of his stepfather.[49][50][51] He changed his name to Khalid Masood after he converted to Islam. Police said he also used several other aliases, including Khalid Choudry.[49][52] Born in Kent, Masood was brought up in Rye, East Sussex, and later attended secondary school in Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Most recently he was living in the West Midlands.[53] When he was 16, he dropped out of school and by 18 he was described as a heavy cocaine user.[54] In 2000, he was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm after a knife attack in a public house in Northiam in Sussex. In 2003, he was sentenced to a further six months in prison for possession of an offensive weapon following another knife attack in Eastbourne in Sussex.[55][56] As well as these two prison terms, Masood had convictions for public order offences going back to 1983.[55][56] A British newspaper obtained a CV of Masood's in which he described himself as having taught English in Saudi Arabia from November 2005 to November 2006, and again from April 2008 to April 2009.[60][61] After this, according to the CV he returned to the United Kingdom and worked at a TEFL college in Luton.[62] In early March 2015, he made a brief trip to Saudi Arabia on an Umrah visa, normally issued to those making a pilgrimage to Mecca.[50][61] During his time in Saudi Arabia he was not recorded as having a criminal record there.[61] In 2010, Masood was a \"peripheral figure\" in an MI5 investigation of a group of Islamists later convicted of plotting to bomb a Territorial Army base in Luton. Following a risk assessment, MI5 decided he did not pose a threat.[63][64] The Metropolitan Police said he was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.[65] He had not been convicted of any terrorism offences.[66] Farasat Latif, director of the language school in Luton where Masood taught between 2010 and 2012, told The Guardian that when Masood lived in Luton he was apolitical and not aligned with the younger and predominantly Asian local radical Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun. Although aware of violence in Masood's past, Latif had only seen him become angry once, when Masood learnt of plans for a march by the English Defence League through Luton.[67] Between 2012 and 2016, Masood appeared in MI5 investigations as a contact of individuals linked to Al-Muhajiroun.[57] Three days before the attack, Masood carried out reconnaissance of Westminster Bridge in person and online.[57] Masood spent the night before the attack at the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton in Sussex and was described as \"laughing and joking\" by the manager there.[68] Pre-inquest revealed that he had used anabolic steroids shortly before the terrorist attack.[69] Masood's profile was atypical in that most jihadi terrorists are under 30, while he was 52. On 22 March, the day of the attack, the Metropolitan Police said it believed the attack was inspired by \"international terrorism\"[70][71] and that they were working under the assumption that it was \"Islamist-related terrorism\".[72][73][74] On 23 March, the Islamic State-associated Amaq News Agency announced that the attacker was \"a soldier of the Islamic State, executing the operation in response to calls to target citizens of coalition nations\".[75] The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, cast doubts on this claim.[76] Analysts monitoring Islamic State online said the claim appeared to be an effort to mask its losses in Iraq and Syria, adding that the lack of biographical information on the attacker and lack of specifics about the attack suggested it was not directly involved.[77] Describing Masood as a \"terrorist\",[78] the Metropolitan Police said it was investigating whether he was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or was being directed by others.[79] On 25 March Neil Basu, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and Senior National Coordinator for UK Counter-Terrorism Policing, announced that investigators believed Masood acted alone.[80] On 27 March, Basu announced that Masood clearly had an interest in jihad, that his methods echoed the rhetoric of Islamic State leaders and that investigators have found no evidence he was linked with it or al-Qaeda.[81][63] The security services later recovered the last WhatsApp message sent by Masood shortly before his attack. In it, Masood reportedly said he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries of the Middle East.[1] He had written a document named \"Jihad in the Quran and Sunnah\", with his photograph on the front page and multiple extracts from the Quran that could be seen as supportive of jihad and martyrdom.[57] He sent this document to numerous contacts a few minutes before the attack.[57] Some early reports gave descriptions of two supposed attackers, one described as a \"bald white man\" and another as a \"black man with goatee beard\".[17] On the morning after the attack, however, Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan Police's Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations, stated that the police believed the attacker acted alone.[70]Abu Izzadeen was also erroneously identified as the attacker on social media, Channel 4 News and The Independent shortly after the attack, although Izzadeen was actually in prison at the time.[82] In April 2017, OFCOM announced an investigation into the Channel 4 News naming of Izzadeen.[83] Police and media outside the Hagley Road premises that were raided on 22 March, seen on the morning following the raid At 23:00 on 22 March, West Midlands Police raided a flat in Hagley Road, Birmingham. By the morning of 23 March, six locations in East London and Birmingham had been raided resulting in the arrests of eight people on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts.[17][48][84] Officials also carried out searches in London, Brighton and Carmarthenshire.[85][48] The investigation was named Operation Classific. By 24 March, three further arrests had taken place, two men overnight in the West Midlands and North West England and a woman during the day in Manchester.[86] A woman, arrested earlier in East London, was released on bail.[87] Later on 24 March, seven of those initially arrested were released without further action and the woman arrested in Manchester was released on bail.[88][20][50] By 25 March, only one man from Birmingham remained in custody and the woman on bail from East London had been removed from police enquiries. Up to that point in the investigation, 2,700 items had been seized and 3,500 witnesses had been contacted.[6] A further arrest was made in Birmingham on 26 March.[89] By 1 April, all 12 suspects arrested after the attack had been released without charge.[90] Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords resumed their normal functions on 23 March, the day after the attack.[20] A one-minute silence in honour of the dead was observed in Parliament, and by London's emergency services, at 09:33. The time was selected to coincide with the start of the day's official parliamentary business.[93][74] In the morning session of parliament, Prime Minister Theresa May said that, \"Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy, but today we meet as normal ... to deliver a simple message: We are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism.\"[93][74] In a later statement following the June 2017 London attack, May stated that all three recent attacks were \"bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamic extremism\".[94] The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Opposition, described the attack as \"an appalling atrocity\".[93][74] The speakers of both Houses of Parliament jointly offered sympathy to those affected, and thanked the emergency services.[95] The Scottish Parliament suspended the day's proceedings, including a debate on a second independence referendum.[96] Some MSPs who opposed the decision to suspend parliament said that doing so was \"giving in to terrorism\".[97] The Metropolitan Police honoured PC Palmer by retiring his shoulder number 4157U; Charlton Athletic F.C. announced that his season ticket seat at the Valley would not be occupied at the club's next home game, but would instead have a club scarf placed over it as a mark of respect.[102] A JustGiving fund was set up, with the target of raising £100,000 for his family, a goal attained in less than 24 hours.[66] A group called \"Muslims United for London\" also raised over £29,000 to support victims and victims' families, releasing a statement saying, \"The British Muslim community stands with the community during these difficult times\".[103][104][105] Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that PC Palmer would be remembered at the National Memorial Arboretum's UK Police Memorial in Staffordshire.[106] On 26 March, in an event organised by Women's March on London, roughly 100 women, including many Muslims, joined hands to form a chain along Westminster Bridge and stood in silence for five minutes to pay tribute to the victims of the attack.[109][110][111] Amber Rudd appeared on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show to call for government backdoor access to encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, which Masood used to send a message shortly before the attack. She announced a meeting with similar technology industry leaders for 30 March, where she would persuade them to voluntarily co-operate with the government. She refused to rule out passing new legislation to this end if the companies do not comply.[112][1] The BBC TV series Hospital was filming a routine meeting at St Mary's when the attack occurred; within minutes St Mary's declared a \"major incident\", one of several central London hospitals to do so. The cameras recorded the involvement of the emergency room and intensive care staff over the next few hours, and then followed the cases of three patients until their discharge. The hour-long episode was broadcast in June, resulting in \"a powerful, moving portrait of a major trauma centre’s response to such an event, and of the brilliant human beings who work there.\"[161]","title":"2017 Westminster attack -

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/this-is-the-man-behind-the-westminster-attack?utm_term=.gumo575dv","text":"Khalid Masood, the man who attacked parliament this week, was born Adrian Elms in Dartford, Kent, on Christmas Day in 1964. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. Masood had been investigated “some years ago” as part of an investigation into violent extremism, prime minister Theresa May told MPs on Thursday. But despite a history of violent criminal offences he was only ever seen as \"peripheral\" in historical terror investigations. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. A former intelligence official told BuzzFeed News: \"The service had him as an SOI [subject of interest] a few years ago but think he didn't meet the threshold for investigation so was not investigated further.\" They added: \"My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he's acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint.\" Metropolitan police Khalid Masood The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \"Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.” Masood’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. In 2000, while living in the village of Northiam, Sussex, Masood, still known then as Elms, was convicted for slashing a man’s face after an argument in a pub. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott. This was a long time ago. I remember Elms being a bit of a troubled character.” Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News The block of flats where Masood lived most recently in Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham. A next-door neighbour who gave her name as Iwona, 45, said he had lived there for seven months. \"I am really surprised, I cannot believe it, I cannot believe it,” she told BuzzFeed News. “As I said, when I saw him I couldn't even think someone could do something like this. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. “Sometimes in the afternoon I saw him taking care of the garden, washing the car, and he was very calm.\" Iwona described the woman he lived with there as being in her thirties and said she wore \"Islamic clothing\". The neighbour said she hadn't seen Masood for a few months and that he just \"took a van and went\". Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. \"The family moved quickly and took their things out of the garage,\" Iwona said. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News Masood's neighbour Iwona at her flat in Quayside, Birmingham. Another neighbour, who gave her name as Sam, said: “He moved out in December and I never really spoke to him. I didn't know his name before. “He had a little boy who was 5 years old. There was a woman – I didn't know if it was his wife or daughter. We’d just say hello in the street.” It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Department for Education said Masood never held qualified status as a teacher, but according to The Sun newspaper he claimed on his CV to have an economics degree and to be a “senior English teacher” at a TEFL college in Luton in 2009. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, the prime minister confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”. Echoing police, she said the “working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology”. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. “He was just like any other guest who checks into the hotel,\" he said. \"We had a brief conversation about where he came from in Birmingham. “He talked about his family, his mum, his dad, his wife. He said his dad was ill and his mum was upset.” Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. Huntleys School website “I am really, really shocked. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. The picture of us in the football team was after we did a 24-hour sponsored football match to raise money for the sports hall,” said Stuart Knight, who went to school with Masood, to TheGuardian. “We would have been about 14 years old. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/westminster-attack-video-shows-apparent-security-flaws-1.3024979","text":"Westminster attack: Video shows apparent security flaws Two men remain in custody in connection with Khalid Masood’s London rampage President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Enda Kenny attend the British embassy in Dublin to sign a book of condolence for the victims of the recent attack on Westminster. Video: Ronan McGreevy Floral tributes in Parliament Square, London, for the victims of the Westminster terror attack. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA Wire British parliamentarians have said the “soft” outer ring of security at the Palace of Westminster must be enhanced after a video showed the complex’s gates were left open and apparently unmanned after Wednesday’s terror attack, which left five people dead. The footage, captured by The London Times, shows the aftermath of the assault on New Palace Yard which left police officer Keith Palmer fatally wounded. Mr Palmer was knifed by the attacker, Khalid Masood, after the terrorist drove a car at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before storming the parliamentary estate armed with two knives. He was then shot dead by police. As armed officers swarm the cobbled forecourt after killing Masood, the footage shows that the iron gate which allows vehicles to enter parliament was apparently left wide open. No police officers are visibly guarding the entry point, known as Carriage Gates, fuelling concern that the attack might have been worse had Masood been followed by accomplices. Pedestrians are shown walking past and at one stage a courier on a moped appears to enter unchallenged. Separate footage had shown British prime minister Theresa May being rushed from the building and into a waiting car just yards away. Former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Ian Blair and ex-House of Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans have both said security will now have to be stepped up. Prison Meanwhile, fears Khalid Masood was groomed for extremism in prison have heightened after it was claimed he turned to Islam while behind bars. Counter-terrorism officers have spent days piecing together what led the 52-year-old to commit Wednesday’s assault in London. Only two men - a 27-year-old and 58-year-old arrested in Birmingham - remain in custody after a hunt for accomplices saw 11 people detained in raids across England. It remains unclear whether the assault was carried out alone or with support. The Saudi Arabian embassy in London said Masood worked in the country for several years, raising the possibility he was radicalised overseas. A childhood friend of the man who was known then as Adrian Elms told The Sun newspaper that Masood first emerged as a Muslim after serving a jail sentence. Mark Ashdown (52) said: “When he first came out, he told me he’d become a Muslim in prison and I thought he was joking. “Then I saw he was quieter and much more serious. “I gave him some cash-in-hand work for a few months as a labourer. “He said he needed time to pray and read the Koran - something about finding inner peace. “There were still flashes of the old Ade, but they were few and far between. “I heard he’d split from his partner and got even more deeply into religion. But nothing could have prepared me for hearing his name on the radio.” Masood’s conversion will fuel concerns about the rising threat of criminals being brought under the influence of hardened jihadists while in prison. British ministers have announced plans to create specialist units within jails to tackle what a government-ordered review last year concluded was a “growing problem”. Saudi statement The Saudi embassy said Masood lived in the country between November 2005 and 2006 and between April 2008 and April 2009, during which time he worked as an English teacher on a work visa. He travelled to the country again for five days in March 2015. It said in a statement: “During his time in Saudi Arabia, Khalid Masood did not appear on the security services’ radar and does not have a criminal record in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” Details of Masood’s history of criminality have continued to come to light, suggesting a propensity for violence which laid the groundwork for his armed rampage on Wednesday. Masood was born in Kent, but moved across the country and used a variety of aliases, including Adrian Russell Ajao. Scotland Yard’s head of counter-terrorism, Mark Rowley, said detectives want to understand his “motivation, preparation and associates” and if he “either acted totally alone, inspired by terrorist propaganda, or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him”. Detectives have seized 2,700 items from the searches, including “massive amounts” of computer data, while about 3,500 witnesses have been spoken to. Searches at three addresses are continuing. Mr Rowley said: “We remain keen to hear from anyone who knew Khalid Masood well, understands who his associates were, and can provide us with information about places he has recently visited. “There might well be people out there who did have concerns about Masood but weren’t sure or didn’t feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing information to us.” Masood was known to police and MI5 but was a “peripheral figure” who was not implicated in any current inquiry. He had convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm, as well as possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. ‘Hero MP’ Hero MP Tobias Ellwood, who tried to save Mr Palmer’s life, and security minister Ben Wallace have been appointed to the Privy Council for their roles in responding to the atrocity. Masood’s victims on the bridge included US tourist Kurt Cochran and his wife Melissa, from Utah, who were on the last day of a trip celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary. Mr Cochran was killed and Ms Cochran was badly injured. Aysha Frade, who worked in administration at independent sixth-form school DLD College London, in Westminster, also died. She is believed to be a 43-year-old mother-of-two. Leslie Rhodes, a retired window cleaner from Clapham, south London, died from injuries sustained in the attack. He was described by neighbours as a “lovely man”. Two people remain in hospital in a critical condition, one with life-threatening injuries. Police officer Kristofer Aves and another member of the force hurt in the attack are also in hospital with “significant injuries”. Police said armed patrols would take place at Wembley Stadium and extra officers would be on the ground when England played a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania on Sunday.","title":"Westminster

{"originalUrl":"http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw4Pzf4jQ","text":"“Owned again! Your site is ours Daesh. You have nowhere to hide. You are weak,” reads a message by hackers waging war on Isis’ online “caliphate”. They are celebrating a huge cyber attack that sees anyone attempting to view the terrorist group’s Amaq propaganda website met with malicious software disguised as an update. By creating a virtual “back door” into devices, it is able to activate cameras, log keystrokes, steal files, read phone messages, take screenshots, detect GPS locations and collect contacts from unsuspecting jihadis. The infiltration forced Isis to issue a warning to followers through Amaq’s encrypted Telegram channel, saying its latest Arabic language website had been “penetrated” by a virus, adding: “Please exercise caution.” Hackers installed malware on an Arabic language propaganda website run by Isis to track supporters When The Independent tried to access the site, it was automatically blocked with a warning from Google that attackers “might attempt to install dangerous programs on your computer that steal or delete your information” including photos, passwords and credit cards. It is the latest move to ensnare Isis supporters through the group’s own propaganda, with a fake version of its Android mobile app previously created to track extremists and convincing forgeries of a propaganda magazine released online. Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR), said extremists were becoming “agitated” by intensifying online attacks. “It’s leaving a lot of Isis paranoid and it’s a joy to behold,” he told The Independent. “Something’s afoot. Someone is putting a lot of effort in sowing discord and paranoia – it’s very effective.” Hackers around the world are launching ever more sophisticated attacks on Isis’ websites and communications, with collectives hailing their success using the hashtags #OpIsis and #OpIceIsis on Twitter. Isis was forced to release a warning to followers over 'false and sometimes dangerous' content Among them is CtrlSec, which has declared its mission to limit and destroy “online extremism in all shapes”. Its founder is Mikro, a 20-something hacktivist leading global efforts to get jihadi Twitter accounts taken down. So brazen were communications that in 2015, Mikro and fellow hacktivists chanced upon an Isis cell in Tunisia plotting attacks on British and Jewish tourists and passed the information to security services, resulting in more than a dozen arrests. The accounts of Isis’ most prolific tweeters have long been removed but supporters and “fanboys” continue to start countless new accounts in running battles to evade activists and moderators. British Isis member Aqsa Mahmood tweeted calls for terror attacks and urged people to travel Syria before her account was shut down (Twitter) Mikro believes technology firms and governments are not doing enough to crack down on extremist social networking, claiming activists’ efforts are more effective. “The day we run out of work then enough is done, but I do not see an end to this in sight,” he added. “We are playing whack-a-mole since third parties don’t collaborate.” Mikro said he has received so many death threats that he stopped bothering to record them two years ago, and keeps his name, identity and location a closely guarded secret for his own safety. Similarly secretive is a Muslim collective called Di5s3nSi0N, which has been hacking websites hosting Isis propaganda including its Amaq and Halummu news agencies, al-Furqan video outlet and al-Bayan online radio station. It overwrites sites with its calling card – a red and black picture with the caption “Stand Against Isis” and the message “HaCK3d by Di5s3nSi0N”, accompanied by smiley faces. The group identifies itself as Sunni Muslim, with a mission statement reading: “The steadfast youth of ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jammah can no longer tolerate the obscenities of the Baghdadi gang who abuse religion and insult the dignity of people.” It sends out frequent tweets aiming to enrage Isis supporters, telling them they are “soooooo weak” and “you are not Muslim”, warning: “We’re coming for you.” Hackers have been leaving messages on websites carrying Isis propaganda Meanwhile, the End of Daesh group describes itself as the “online nemesis of Isis”, calling for help to “smash” extremist sites with cyber attacks. Gregg Housh, a former Anonymous activist, said hackers were using a range of methods including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that flood websites with traffic until they crash, to great effect. “I think the hacktivists are winning the battle for one very simple reason,” he told The Independent. “When you have to move, your user base has to find the new sites and accounts. “It’s hard to build a large following and a large amount of influence if you have to keep jumping around to new domains, new hosts and new Twitter accounts.” But Mr Winter warned that Isis is continually adapting to spread its message, even as it loses swathes of territory around its most symbolic strongholds in Syria and Iraq. “Certainly the landscape has changed profoundly over the course of the past few years, but the group is still eminently capable in propaganda dissemination,” he said. “A website gets knocked down and it comes back exactly the same in a few days or hours with a slightly different url…it’s a game of cat and mouse.” Timeline: The emergence of Isis Timeline: The emergence of Isis 1/40 2000 Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (pictured here) forms an al-Qaeda splinter group in Iraq, al-Qa’eda in Iraq.

AFP Mr Winter said that although it had become more difficult for Isis to circulate its propaganda and posts do not stay online for as long as they once did, the group is still publishing huge amounts of articles, magazines, videos, photos and audio files. “No matter how inhospitable the environment is, they’re still going to be able to use the internet,” he added, warning of far-right websites republishing Isis material that remains “very easy to access”. Mr Winter said: “Islamphobes are circulating propaganda more efficiently than Isis itself can ever do, we need to start having that conversation.” The Westminster attack has once again turned the British Government’s focus on to the group’s online propaganda efforts after Isis claimed responsibility for the massacre the left four victims dead. Revelations that Khalid Masood used the messaging service WhatsApp just minutes before launching his attack sparked fresh debate over encryption and privacy, with communications providers meeting the Home Secretary on Thursday. Amber Rudd said that although progress has been made, she would “like to see the industry to go further and faster in not only removing online terrorist content but stopping it going up in the first place”. “I’d also like to see more support for smaller and emerging platforms to do this as well, so they can no longer be seen as an alternative shop floor by those who want to do us harm,” technology firms were told. Iraqi PM says Isis will be defeated 'within the next few weeks' Michael S Smith II, a terrorism expert who recently gave evidence at the Global Coalition conference hosted by the Foreign Office, agrees, arguing that companies need to “increase the risk of exploiting their technologies to recruit and incite violence”. “There’s really only so much that the UK government can do apart from diplomacy,” he added. “Propaganda is merely one factor in the larger set of problems when you look at Isis’ unprecedented recruitment and incitement capabilities.” He warned that Isis was using social media not only to spread its message, but to incite and control attacks, including a 2015 shooting at an exhibit featuring cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed in Texas. That was linked to British Isis hacker Junaid Hussain, who foreshadowed attack on Twitter after the perpetrators used the social network to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mr Smith argued that Western governments had been left behind by Isis’ exploitation of technology created in their own countries, with the group issuing detailed advice on how to encrypt communications and evade detection. He called for more efforts to disrupt the publication of extremist material, warning that once it was flagged and removed, it was “too late” to stop countless copies popping up elsewhere. “When you see all these hactivist groups forming, Isis has succeeded in undermining confidence in our governments’ capability to manage threats emanating from the cyber domain,” he added. The British Government’s Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit, which searches for extremist material and works with internet companies to take it down, has helped remove 250,000 pieces of

At least four people are dead after a terror attacker brought carnage to central London today, mowing down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before attacking police with a knife in the grounds of the Houses of Parliament. More than 12 people are said to have been hit by a vehicle on the bridge after a 4x4 drove into pedestrians and cyclists before crashing into the gates of Parliament. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that one of their servicemen was stabbed to death outside parliament by the attacker. Fellow officers and social media users have paid tribute to the officer, using the hashtag #ThinBlueLine. A police officer was stabbed by the knifeman before he was shot by other officers. Paramedics are now treating the injured Leah‏ wrote on Twitter: 'My thoughts are with everyone involved in the Westminster incident.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-45190825","text":"The latest terror attack in London gets prominent coverage in most of the papers. The Daily Telegraph shows the suspect in a padded jacket being held by police after a car was rammed into cyclists and a security barrier. It reports that he was from Birmingham and lived near the Westminster Bridge attacker, Khalid Masood. The paper suggests this latest attempt was a \"botched copycat\". The Sun injects a note of scorn about the vehicle which was used with its headline \"Terrorist in a Fiesta\". The Daily Express pictures armed officers surrounding the car and highlights their bravery in running towards the threat. The paper urges that the officers are honoured for their actions. A large picture of a motorway bridge with a huge gap in the middle dominates the Times front page. A lorry can be seen just feet from the edge of a substantial drop in the Italian city of Genoa. The section which collapsed killed at least 26 people. Several lorries and large amounts of rubble are clearly visible. Image copyrightReutersImage caption The bridge in Genoa had been built in the 1960s The Daily Mail is keeping up its pressure on Jeremy Corbyn for going to a Palestinian cemetery in Tunisia where wreaths were laid on the graves of men linked to the 1972 Munich Olympics terror attack. It has photos of Mr Corbyn which it claims are \"definitive proof\" he took part in the service. The Guardian reports Labour's view on the story that the claims are \"false and misleading\". The political blogger Guido Fawkes reports that Mr Corbyn has been reported to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for not declaring the trip to Tunis. It has published the letter of complaint written by the Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen. The Times' diary section tells how a woman in Guernsey used an ancient legal intervention in a bid to halt local roadworks. Rosie Henderson dropped to her knees crying \"Haro! Haro! Haro!\" followed by a plea to the Duke of Normandy, and a version of the Lord's prayer in Guernsey-French patois. The Telegraph explains that the ancient Norman rite called the Clameur de Haro compels the local courts to make a decision. However, it was all to no avail. Her appeal was rejected on the grounds that she didn't own the land concerned. And the Sun reports on the romantic lengths some people will go to when proposing to their beloved. It has photos of a giant crop circle which reads: \"Anisha, Marry Me?\" Varun Bhanot took months finding a farmer in Cheshire who would let him do it. As the couple flew over the site, he produced an engagement ring.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/westminster-attack?utm_term=.btBmR3ENQ","text":"Everyone Arrested In Connection With The Westminster Attack Has Now Been Released Khalid Masood, born Adrian Russell Ajao, was named as the attacker. He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. Three civilians, Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, and a police officer, Keith Palmer, have been identified as his victims. What We Know So Far: Khalid Masood, 52, originally from Kent, was named as the Westminster attacker by the Metropolitan police. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. He had no prior terrorism offence convictions, although he had been previously investigated by security services as a \"peripheral figure\". Police released a picture of him on Friday. At least five people died — including a police officer and Masood — and 31 others required hospital treatment. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility through its news agency, calling the assailant – who it did not name – its \"soldier\". Map Shows Locations Of Incidents In Westminster Attack Chris Applegate / Tom Phillips / BuzzFeed News / Google Maps Updates Posted at Apr. 01, 2017, at 12:12 PM All people arrested in connection with the Westminster terror attack have now been released All those arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in Westminster have now been released and police will take no further action. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and detained under the Terrorism Act was released on Sunday, Met police said in a statement. Eleven other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have also been released with no further action. The inquest into the death of Khalid Masood was adjourned on Thursday and a pre-inquest review has been set by the coroner for May 19. Posted at Mar. 30, 2017, at 17:46 PM London attacker killed by single gunshot to chest, coroner says Matt Dunham / AP The man who mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally attacking a police officer outside parliament was killed by a single gunshot to the chest, coroner's officials said. In all, Khalid Masood killed four people and injured more than 30 others in the March 22 attack before he was shot dead. One other person remains hospitalized in critical condition. Masood's cause of death was revealed Thursday in Westminster coroner's court, the Associated Press reported. —Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 28, 2017, at 07:17 AM Wife of Khalid Masood expresses her sorrow for those killed Dan Kitwood / Getty Images Rohey Hydara, wife of the man who attacked parliament last week, gave a statement through police in which she expressed her \"sadness\" for those who had lost their lives. \"I express my condolences to the families of the victims that have died and wish a speedy recovery to all the injured,\" the BBC reported her as saying. Hydara, believed to be Masood's second wife, also asked for privacy for \"our family, especially the children, at this difficult time\". It comes following the mother of Masood, who was born Adrian Elms, stating she was \"shocked\" and \"deeply saddened\" by the actions of her son. Masood, 52, drove a car across Parliament Bridge, injuring scores of people, before crashing the vehicle into railings at the side of the houses of parliament. He then assaulted police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries, before being shot dead by officers on the scene. Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 17:05 PM Mother of London attacker says she is \"deeply shocked\" by his actions Matt Dunham / AP The mother of the man who carried out the deadly attack in London says she is \"deeply shocked, saddened, and numbed\" by his actions. In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. —Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 16:13 PM No evidence Masood had any direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, Met police say More information has emerged about the actions of the man who killed four people – including a police officer – outside the houses of parliament before being shot dead. Speaking on Monday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for UK counterterrorism policing, said there was \"no evidence\" the man who took the name Khalid Masood in 2005, having been born Adrian Elms, had discussed his intentions prior to the assault. \"His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low-tech, low-cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of IS leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others.\" Basu continued that while there were no direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, \"there is clearly an interest in jihad\". He also said there was \"no evidence\" Masood had been radicalised in prison, adding that \"this is pure speculation at this time\". —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 17:24 PM Police make new arrest Richard Vernalls / PA Wire/PA Images Police in Birmingham on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested in Birmingham in connection with Wednesday's attack in Westminster, it was announced on Sunday night. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Meanwhile, UK home secretary Amber Rudd has said it is \"completely unacceptable\" that messages Khalid Masood may have sent on WhatsApp before launching his deadly attack remain encrypted. \"There should be no place for terrorists to hide,\" Rudd said on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. \"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:26 AM Police: Khalid Masood acted alone Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images The Metropolitan police have said they believe Westminster attacker Khalid Masood acted alone, and warned that we may never know why he acted as he did. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. \"We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned,\" said deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing. \"Even if he acted alone in the preparation we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts to bring reassurance to Londoners, and to provide answers and closure for the families of those killed and the victims and survivors of this atrocity.\" But Basu added: \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this. That understanding may have died with him. \"Nevertheless, we are determined to understand if Masood was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice.\" Appealing for members of the public to help the investigation into the killings, Basu said: \"If you knew Khalid Masood and had spoken to him in the months, weeks or days leading up to this attack please come forward.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:18 AM Family of murdered PC \"overwhelmed\" by support Metropolitan police The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer have said they are \"overwhelmed by the love and support\" they have received since the 48-year-old was killed. \"Most especially,\" a statement released through the Metropolitan police added, \"the outpouring of love and respect for our Keith.\" The statement said: \"We want to thank everyone who has reached out to us over the past few days for their kindness and generosity. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. \"We would also like to express our gratitude to the people who were with Keith in his last moments and who were working that day. There was nothing more you could have done. \"You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. We miss him so much, but we are also incredibly proud of Keith.\" Jack Taylor / Getty Images Tory MP Tobias Ellwood shakes hands with police outside parliament as he arrives for work the day after the attack. Meanwhile Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to Palmer after the officer had been stabbed by Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, has said he is \"heartbroken\" he could not save him. \"I am heartbroken that I could not do more for PC Keith Palmer who gave his life in holding the line against terrorism and defending democracy. I shall be writing to the family of PC Palmer to offer my sincere condolences,\" he said in a statement. \"I'm deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support, especially from the policing fraternity, which I now realise is as close knit as the military's in supporting its own. \"I played only a small part that day, doing what I was taught to do, and am honoured to have been invited to join the Privy Council afterwards. \"It is right that we concentrate our thoughts on the victims as we stand side by side to protect all that we hold dear, including our precious values and way of life which will always prevail.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 22:56 PM Police say deadly Westminster attack lasted 82 seconds Kirsty Wigglesworth / AP The deadly Westminster attack that left four people dead Wednesday began and was over within 82 seconds, police said Saturday. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this,\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said in a statement. \"That understanding may have died with him.\" Authorities believe he acted alone. \"Whilst the attack lasted only 82 seconds it will remain in the memories of many forever,\" Basu said. —Salvador Hernandez Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 17:40 PM Only one person remains in custody over Wednesday's attack On Saturday evening police revealed that one of the two people still in custody in connection with the attack in Westminster had been released. The 27-year-old man arrested late on Thursday in Birmingham was told he would face no further action. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London and bailed until the end of this month has also been released with no further action. Seven other people have also been released and one woman remains out on bail, meaning only one person remains in custody over Khalid Masood's attack –&nbsp;a 58-year-old man who was arrested on Thursday morning at an address in Birmingham, who is being detained under anti-terror laws. Two men still in custody in connection with attack Victoria Jones / PA Wire/PA Images Seven of the 11 people arrested by police investigating Khalid Masood's attack this week have now been released with no further action, it was announced last night. As well as the six people released from custody last night, a 35-year-old man has been released with no further police action, and a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until the end of the month. Both were arrested in Manchester. Meanwhile, two men remain in custody: a 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham on Thursday morning, and a 28-year-old man arrested later in the day at a separate address in the city. They are being detained under the Terrorism Act 2000. One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. She is due to return to police until a date later this month. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 20:17 PM Six people arrested in London attack investigation are released Christopher Furlong / Getty Images Authorities on Friday released six people who were arrested as part of the ongoing investigation into the attack in London. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Khalid Masood – born Adrian Elms – has been named as the man who killed four people and injured 50 others in an attack on Westminster on Wednesday. Here's everything we know about him. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 17:18 PM Muslim leaders in Birmingham are holding emergency meetings across the city There are concerns of a ramped up anti-Muslim backlash that communities may face following the London terror attack. Mahmooda Qureshi from Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism campaign group, told BuzzFeed News a rally was being organised in Birmingham city centre on Saturday, and said: \"It's to distance ourselves and that it has got nothing to do with Islam and to state: not in our name.\" Imams from major Birmingham mosques read sermons addressing the attacks, and called for \"unity\". At a packed Friday prayers with Muslims from all backgrounds, Sheikh Abdur Raheem McCarthy said in a sermon delivered in English that Muslims were \"blessed\" in the UK as they have freedom of faith. \"We also need to increase our relationship with the local community. And instead of making this divide us, let it bring us closer together and let us stand in solidarity against that which is wrong.\" After prayers, the imam read out a statement from the Metropolitan police reassuring the communities there would be extra patrols on the streets, and that the attack was by \"a terrorist and someone not of the faith\". Muhammad Afzal, the chairman of Birmingham Central Mosque, called for calm and said in a statement: \"We request all communities for the unity and calm.\" He added: \"We call upon those that may have even a shred of sympathy for the like-minded terrorists to shake their conscience and realise that such acts are the work of evil and not the work of God-fearing people.\" In the aftermath of Wednesday's attack in London, this photo of a woman walking along Westminster bridge went viral. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. —Rachael Krishna Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 14:29 PM Met police release image of Masood in appeal for information Met Police In an updated statement, the Met police clarified that Masood had previously gone by both Adrian Elms and Adrian Russell Ajao. \"He may also be known by a number of other names,\" they added. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 13:54 PM Downing Street says Google and Facebook \"can and must do more\" to fight extremism Alamy Downing Street added to pressure on Google and Facebook on Friday, warning the internet giants that they \"can and must do more\" to stop hateful and violent material appearing on their platforms. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. As a general point, however, he told reporters that the \"fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one\" and that the technology companies weren't, in the government's view, pulling their weight. \"Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure that this material is not disseminated,\" the Number 10 official said. \"And we have been clear repeatedly that we think they can and must do more. And we are always talking with them on how to achieve that.\" \"The message that we've delivered consistently is that we want them to do more and the ball is now in their court,\" he added. \"Let's see how they respond.\" First images of Masood as a schoolchild emerge Huntleys School Website This photograph, taken when Masood was at school, is believed to have been taken after a four-hour five-a-side tournament for charity. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. \"He had a big personality and everyone liked him,\" Till said. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. The fourth victim, 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes, was named by the Met police today. Rhodes was a retired window cleaner, who was described by neighbours as a \"lovely man,\" according to the Press Association. The neighbour told the news organisation Rhodes had no children and was not married, and that he \"would do anything for anybody\". American Kurt Cochran was identified yesterday. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. \" She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us,\" a spokesperson for the college told BuzzFeed News. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. In a statement on Thursday, his family said he would be remembered as a \"wonderful dad and husband,\" a loving son, brother, and uncle, and a long-time supporter of Charlton FC. He was a friend to \"everyone who knew him\" and was brave, dedicated, courageous, and proud to be a police officer, they said. Met police release more information about Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's birth name has been stated as Adrian Russell Ajao, acting deputy police commissioner Mark Rowley has said in a briefing outside New Scotland Yard this morning. \"We stated he had a number of aliases, and we do know that his birth name was Adrian Russell,\" Rowley said. Rowley said there was \"no evidence of further threats\", but that a \"large, fast paced investigation\" was examining Masood's actions leading up the attack: \"Our determination is to find out if he acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others encouraged or supported him.\" Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. \"We have seized 2,700 items from these searches,\" he said, including \"massive of amounts of computer data for us to search through\". Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. \"Those affected include a real cross-section of ages, from at least 12 nationalities,\" he continued. He said of those in hospital, two remained in \"critical condition\", with one person considered to have \"life-threatening\" injuries. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Details around the attacker, named by the Metropolitan police as 52-year-old Khalid Masood, continue to emerge on Friday morning. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Sadiq Khan, who spoke at the vigil, told BuzzFeed News it was a way of showing \"evil and twisted individuals\" that they were not going to be successful in their aims. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. Houses searched in Brighton and Wales Joe Giddens / PA Wire/PA Images Officers search an address in Birmingham connected to Wednesday's attack. The Metropolitan police have confirmed to BuzzFeed News that as part of today's investigations, houses were also searched in Brighton and Wales. Previously police had only said searches were carried out in London, Birmingham, and \"elsewhere\". The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Overnight a 39-year-old woman was arrested at an address in east London; a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man were arrested at an address in Birmingham; a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 26, 27, and 28 were arrested at a separate address in Birmingham – all on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. \"It's important to stress that we are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident and no police officers are under investigation,\" said IPCC deputy chair Sarah Green. \"The IPCC and the Metropolitan Police Service are following agreed working arrangements related to terrorist incidents, which are working well. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. We are giving this investigation the highest priority and we will conclude it as soon as possible.\" PM visits victims injured in the Westminster attack The PM quietly visited victims who were injured in the attack along Westminster Bridge on Thursday afternoon. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. – Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 16:16 PM Keith Palmer's family: \"A wonderful dad and husband\" Dominic Lipinski / PA Wire/PA Images In a statement, Palmer's family said the former soldier and policeman of 15 years was \"dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous\". Palmer, 48, who was married and had a 5-year-old daughter, was described as \"a wonderful dad and husband\". \"A loving son, brother and uncle. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. We love him so much,\" his family said. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. Colleague PC James Aitkenhead described him as \"a genuinely nice person; nobody had a bad word to say about him. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. \"He had a great work ethic, he worked on our warrants' car for years, getting up at 4am to serve warrants and arresting wanted offenders. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early.\" The 52-year-old was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said \"was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack\". He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was investigated \"some years ago\" as part of a historic investigation into violent extremism but was a peripheral figure. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been called on to retract his statement that the Westminster terror attack on Wednesday was linked to uncontrolled immigration – after it emerged that the security services believe the attacker was born in Britain. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. \"The moment has come for us to point the finger of blame. What these politicians have done in the last 15 years will affect how we live for 100 years,\" he said. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Kurt Cochran, from Utah, was killed in terror attack in Westminster, and his wife Melissa was seriously injured and is in hospital in London. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. \"We are grateful that she will recover,\" he said in the post. \"Our hearts ache for her and their children in losing their loving companion and father. Please continue to pray for our family. Thank you.\" Another relative, Shantell Payne, wrote in a separate Facebook post on Thursday: \"This pain is so heart wrenching and raw it has rocked our family and all that knew him to its core. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. RIP.\" After seeing a picture of his local liaison officer Søren D. Sozza in news coverage of the attack, Mark Oakley, who owns The Eagle pub in Vauxhall, situated near the attack, was moved to share his gratitude on Facebook. \"This image has reinforced my love and respect for the many officers who I have worked with for many years and seeing how close this terror is to where I live and work, and knowing that one of his colleagues was murdered on our streets has deeply saddened me tonight,\" he wrote. Sozza told BuzzFeed News he was \"humbled by Mark's very kind words of appreciation and am encouraged by his defiance to being affected by the incident\". World leaders express condolences for London and the British people Vladimir Putin, Russia's leader, released the following statement: \"Terrorist attacks are becoming increasingly cunning and cynical. It is obvious that all members of the international community should join forces to stand up against the terrorist threat.\" Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. Yesterday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said US president Donald Trump had spoken to Theresa May, and that the US was continuing to monitor the situation. German chancellor Angela Merkel, before more details about the nature of the attack had been established, said: \"Even if the background to these attacks has yet to be cleared up, I would like to emphasise on behalf of Germany and its citizens: We stand resolutely on Britain's side in the fight against any form of terrorism.\" François Hollande, France's leader, declared France's \"solidarity and support\" for Britain and the victims of the attack. \"Terrorism affects us all,\" he said. \"France, which has been so badly hit in recent times, knows what the British people are suffering today.\" The Netherlands' leader, Mark Rutte, said: \"Horrible images from London. The very heart of the city has been struck. Our thoughts are with the British people.\" And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. \"Belgium stands with UK in fight against terror,\" he said. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 13:20 PM Security services could have dropped monitoring attacker because of resources or the closure of an investigation Stressing they did not know the identity of the attacker, a former British intelligence officer told BuzzFeed News that \"peripheral figure\" would indicate an individual that MI5 would have looked into, and possibly monitored, for reasons of behaviour, background, or connections. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. An indiscriminate attack by a British-born terrorist was a strike against \"free people everywhere\" and injured people from various countries, Theresa May told the House of Commons on Thursday. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. The man had been investigated \"some years ago\" because of concerns about violent extremism but was considered a \"peripheral\" figure, May said. \"The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture,\" May said. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. \"We are not afraid. And our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,\" she said. Scotland's first minister has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful\" city of London Wpa Pool / Getty Images Nicola Sturgeon has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful city\" of London during a sombre edition of First Minister's Questions at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. \"Many of us in this chamber have friends and colleagues, indeed some of us have family members, who work within the Palace of Westminster,\" said Sturgeon. \"Parliamentarians, staff, and journalists. \"Yesterday was a harrowing day for all of them and they have our support and good wishes. Above all, we stand in solidarity with London – a vibrant, diverse, wonderful city that will never be cowed by mindless acts of violence.\" Sturgeon went on to confirm that there was \"no intelligence of any increased threat\" to Scotland in the wake of yesterday's attack in London, but added that security had been stepped up in \"key locations\" throughout the country. \"Acts of terrorism are not the responsibility of any one faith or section of our society,\" the first minister continued. \"The only people to blame for acts of terrorism are the individuals who plan and perpetrate them.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson expressed her \"deep shock\" at the events in London, but went on to warn would-be attackers: \"We will not be silenced, and we will not be cowed.\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale described Westminster as a \"beacon of democracy\", and went on to say that \"this cannot and must not turn into a war on any one community\". The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Following the attack, an image of a London Underground sign began to circulate on Twitter. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. \"My judgment is he or she speaks for the whole country irrespective of faith of creed when they wrote: 'All terrorists are politely reminded that this is London and whatever you do to us we will drink tea and jolly well carry on',\" he told the house. May called it a \"wonderful tribute\", and said it \"in a very simple way I think has encapsulated everything everybody in this house has said today\". \"What happened yesterday was an appalling atrocity,\" he said. \"Today, we are united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity. \"I express my condolences to the family and friends of PC Keith Palmer, who gave his life yesterday in defence of the public and our democracy – and to the loved ones of those still in a critical condition including the French schoolchildren visiting our capital from Concarneau in Brittany. ... \"I thank all the dedicated NHS staff working to save lives, including those from St Thomas' Hospital who rushed out to help those in need. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. \"It behoves us all not to rush to judgement, but to wait for the police to establish the facts. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred.\" The Scottish National Party's leader in the House of Commons Angus Robertson echoed May and Corbyn's sentiments, saying: \"Today of all days we are reminded that notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none.\" Robertson also paid tribute to police,and the bravery of the Conservative minister who went to the aid of the stabbed officer: \"'We are all hugely grateful to all the police, security staff and first responders who ran towards danger without concern to their safety, and I include in that our colleague the Right Honourable and gallant member for Bournemouth East Tobias Ellwood.\" Parliament is to review its security procedures in an emergency meeting later today in the wake of yesterday's terror attack. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. \"We will be having an emergency meeting,\" he said. \"We'll be getting information, what else needs to be put in place, and we will reflect, not instantly, we've got to take on board what's happened and we will make decisions accordingly. Of course, we've got to look after both houses.\" TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. People from 10 different countries caught up in attack, PM says Sky News screengrab Speaking in the Commons, Theresa May revealed some details about those injured in the attack. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. \"We are in close contact with the governments of the countries of all those affected,\" the prime minister said. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:49 AM PM Theresa May says attacker was \"British-born\" and had been previously investigated by MI5 as a \"peripheral\" figure Addressing the House of Commons, prime minister Theresa May confirmed that the attacker, who has still not been publicly identified, was known to MI5 and police and had been a \"peripheral figure\" in a \"historic\" investigation into violent extremism. \"It is still believed that this attacker acted alone and there is no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public,\" she said. \"His identity is known to police and MI5 and when operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. \"What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. Intensive investigations continue.\" May also reiterated earlier lines from the police and defence secretary Michael Fallon that the investigation is focusing on the \"working assumption\" the attacker was \"inspired by Islamist ideology\". \"We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real,\" she said. \"But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not – and will not – be cowed by this threat. \"As acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley has made clear, we are stepping up policing to protect communities across the country and to reassure the public.\" May praised the security and emergency forces for their swift and calm response to the attack, made more remarkable after they had \"lost one of their own\". \"We will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security, and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way,\" she said. \"On behalf of the whole country I want to pay tribute to them for the work they have been doing to reassure the public, treat the injured and bring security back to the streets of our capital city. \"That they have lost one of their own in yesterday's attack only makes their calmness and professionalism all the more remarkable.\" —James Ball and Francis Whittaker Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:43 AM Prime minister reveals nationalities of those wounded and more details on attacker in speech to House of Commons Westminster Bridge survivor: \"The car came out of nowhere\" Carl Court / Getty Images BuzzFeed News has spoken to a survivor who was hit by the attacker's car and flung to the ground on Westminster Bridge, and who said he was unable to describe the Wednesday's events because of the horrific aftermath. The survivor, who asked not to be named, was visiting London from Liverpool and sustained cuts and bruises to his legs – he was with friends who were also hit by the car but survived. He has now been discharged from hospital. \"There was just lot of yelling and commotion,\" he said. \"Then this car came out of nowhere and knocked me and my mates over. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. They were pretty horrific.\" —Pat Smith Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:23 AM Met police have made another arrest in connection to the attack In total eight people have now been arrested, following raids on six properties across the country. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 09:47 AM Minute's silence held for those killed in Westminster attack The streets around parliament remained closed on Thursday morning. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. \"Such acts of savagery against the innocent can never be justified,\" Fox said. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of those killed in Wednesday's attack on Westminster, her place of work confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Thursday morning. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. \"We are all deeply shocked and saddened at the news that one of the victims yesterday was a member of our staff, Aysha Frade. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. We will be offering every support we can to them as they try to come to terms with their devastating loss,\" Rachel Borland, principal at DLD College London, told BuzzFeed News. \"Aysha worked as a member of our administration team at the college. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us.\" According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Met police revise death toll to four, including attacker Four people, including the attacker, died in the attack on Westminster yesterday, the Metropolitan police confirmed to BuzzFeed News this morning following Commissioner Mark Rowley's earlier statement. Previous statements from New Scotland Yard had said that five people – including the attacker –&nbsp;had been killed in the assault outside the British parliament. Defence secretary Michael Fallon says security services' working assumption is that the attack was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\" Andy Buchanan / AFP / Getty Images Defence secretary Michael Fallon, speaking to the BBC's Today programme, said the \"working assumption\" was that the attack on Westminster was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\". Fallon said the Metropolitan police were making \"urgent\" investigations into the alleged attacker and his known associates – although he declined to state whether there was any indication he acted alone. \"The working assumption is that this is related to Islamic terrorism in some form, but they [the police] don't yet have a full enough picture of this man and his known associates. That work is still going on,\" he said. \"This kind of attack, this lone-wolf attack, using things from daily life, a vehicle, a knife, are much more difficult to forestall, and we are also dealing with a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage but simply wants to kill as many people as possible. \"This is a new element to international terrorism but our forces are working extremely hard. I have every confidence that they will track down his known associates.\" The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. \"Although there is intense security around the Palace of Westminster, London is going to work this morning,\" Fallon said. \"Parliament itself will resume at the normal time.\" \"London is getting back to work. London has seen this before and is taking it on the chin,\" he said. \"I do want to reassure you that the police and the security services are doing everything possible to make sure that people can go about their daily life as safely as possible.\" The Metropolitan police confirm seven arrests made last night Mark Rowley, the national lead for counterterrorism policing and the acting deputy commissioner, confirmed that seven arrests had been made, following raids on six properties across the country. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Among the dead were a \"mix of nationalities\", Rowley said, declining to name any of those killed other than 48-year-old police officer Keith Palmer. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. Probed on the identity of the alleged attacker, Rowley declined to comment on the individual's nationality and said he would not be naming the suspect – and urged the media to respect that decision. \"It is still our belief that this attacker acted alone, and was inspired by international terrorism,\" Rowley said. Meanwhile, he said London will see an increased police presence, as at least 60 officers continue working on a \"large and complicated crime scene\" outside Westminster. \"We must not allow terrorism to sow discord and fear in our city,\" he said. —Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 07:34 AM Police make ”several\" arrests following raid on property in Birmingham, multiple reports state Carl Court / Getty Images The police have made \"several\" arrests after a raid on a property in Birmingham, the BBC, ITV, and Sky News have reported. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Press inquiries to West Midlands police were redirected to the Metropolitan police, who declined to comment on the reports when contacted by BuzzFeed News, citing \"operational reasons\". Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. \"There is an ongoing police operation, no further details are being given at this stage,\" West Midlands police told The Guardian. Separately, it was reported the car – described by witnesses as a Hyundai 4x4 – used to plough through pedestrians in the cycle line on Westminster Bridge was believed to have been rented from near the raided property in Solihull. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner told the Today programme that there were \"indications\" that the car began its journey in Birmingham. Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 22:48 PM Slain officer is identified as death toll rises to 5 people BBC The death toll in Wednesday's Westminster attack rose to five people, including the attacker and a police officer, who was identified as a 15-year veteran. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Metro Police Getty Keith Palmer. \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that to happen,\" Rowley said. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. \"Terrorists have a clear aim: that is to create discord, destruction, and to create fear,\" he said. \"The police stand with all communities in the UK and will take action against anyone who seeks to undermine society, especially where their crimes are motivated by hate.\" —Claudia Koerner Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 21:27 PM Government officials describe crawling on hands and knees to escape attack Carl Court / Getty Images Grant Shapps was walking through from his office to a vote in the House of Commons, making small talk with a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, when he noticed something was amiss at the gates of parliament. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. \"I could hear a kerfuffle going on, which is not unusual as there's often protests by the gates,\" the former minister told BuzzFeed News. \"As I'm looking around I hear, 'BAM BAM BAM' – what sounded like four shots to me.\" \"Suddenly, a police officer is standing right where we are, shouting, 'Get down, get down, get back!' We crawled, hands and knees, back to a safety position.\" The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Prime minister Theresa May says attack targeted freedom and democracy BBC Theresa May on Wednesday night said the attack at Westminster was no accident, but rather a direct attack on British democracy. \"The location of this attack was no accident,\" the prime minister said in a speech outside Number 10. \"The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions, and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy, and freedom of speech.\" The single attacker first drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, May said, killing two people and injuring others – including three police officers. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. \"And we will all move forward together,\" she said, \"never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us.\" News reports identify wrong man as Westminster attacker A Channel 4 News report misidentified a man associated with a British Muslim terrorist group as the Westminster attacker on its evening broadcast. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The mistaken report was repeated at the top of the Channel 4+1 news, which began to rebroadcast the earlier report. The channel then went dark as \"conflicting information came to light,\" a Channel 4 News statement said. The first doctor to attend to those injured in the Westminster attack was not on duty at the time, but rushed to the scene when he heard screaming. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. \"I heard the screaming so ran to help and the police ran me in,\" he told us. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. —Laura Silver Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:30 PM Politicians and staff locked inside buildings in Westminster Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images Hundreds of politicians and their staff are still locked in Westminster Abbey, while police attempt to collect eyewitness testimony and evidence on this afternoon's attack. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. People still on the premises were then led into the ancient Westminster Hall at around 4.30pm – around 90 minutes after the attack. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Many were then led out through the St Stephen's Entrance into Westminster Abbey, where \"up to 1,000 people\" remain, according to one individual, who said others had been left in Westminster Hall. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. —Jim Waterson Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:08 PM Home secretary praises bravery of emergency services Daniel Sorabji / AFP / Getty Images Forensics officers at work at the scene. Home secretary Amber Rudd has released the following statement on the attack: \"We do not yet know the full impact of this terrible incident. But I know that the whole country will be thinking and praying for those who are affected, as I am. \"I want to thank the emergency services for the quick response and pay tribute to their bravery, their courage and their professionalism. \"I have been briefed by the Met Police and by the security services and the Security Minister has also been updated. This is an ongoing incident and the Government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. \"The Government's top priority is the security of its people and I urge everyone to remain calm but to be vigilant and if they see anything they are concerned about they should report it to the police. \"We have the best police, the best security services in the world and we must make sure that we let them get on with doing their job. \"The British people will be united in working together to defeat those who would harm our shared values. \"Values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. Values symbolised by the Houses of Parliament. Values that will never be destroyed.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:03 PM Hospital releases latest update condition of those injured in attack King's College Hospital assistant medical director Dr Chris Palin has told the BBC eight patients from the attack are being treated at the Denmark Hill hospital. \"At 3.52pm we went into a major incident. We have received a total of eight patients,\" Palin said. \"Two of those are critically injured, six are stable. Six males and two females. Care is still ongoing. All eight remain in the hospital.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 18:58 PM Trump offers condolences to Theresa May during call about Westminster attack US president Donald Trump called the UK prime minister to offer support Wednesday afternoon. A readout of the call provided by the White House said: \"President Donald J. Trump spoke today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom to offer his condolences on today's terror attack in London and his praise for the effective response of security forces and first responders. \"He pledged the full cooperation and support of the United States Government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. \"We obviously condemn today's attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism, and we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation,\" he said. \"The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers. \"The city of London and Her Majesty's government have the full support of the US government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible.\" Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords will sit tomorrow at their normal times. —Alicia Melville-Smith Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 18:34 PM Witnesses on London Eye describe being kept in the air for hours Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images People are seen inside the pods of the London Eye during the incident Tourists on the London Eye, the landmark ferris wheel not far from parliament on the other side of the Thames, have described how they were kept in their capsules for three hours as the attack unfolded. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. \"The first thing we noticed was the flashing lights of medics attending to the injured people on the bridge, and then the helicopters,\" he told BuzzFeed News. \"There were three separate groups of injured people on the bridge, at each end and in the middle. It took half an hour before anyone was moved.\" He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Jim Hutchinson Kody and Taylor Davis, from Utah, told BuzzFeed News they were at the top of the London Eye when it came to a stop. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. \"We eventually managed to call our families and they told us what had happened.\" Taylor said they first had an idea something was wrong when they saw \"a big commotion and lots of stretchers\". Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. \"The attack started when a car was driven over Westminster Bridge hitting and injuring a number of members of the public, including three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony,\" Rowley said. He added that police \"we're satisfied at this stage that there looks to be only one attacker but it would be foolish to be over-confident so early on.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:48 PM Photograph appears to show knives at scene of parliament attack This photograph taken from inside the Palace of Westminster by PA's Stefan Rousseau shows an armed officer standing on what appears to be a knife.

The number of those injured has not been confirmed. \"Solidarity with our British friends, terribly stricken, full support to the injured French students, their families, and their comrades,\" he tweeted. —Sara Spary Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:30 PM Eyewitness describes hearing gunshots and seeing bodies on the ground at Westminster Matt Haikin was cycling across Westminster Bridge when he saw what he thought was a car crash. \"I saw a body, a man I think, lying in the road and a crashed car. I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. \"I didn't think anything else was going on until I saw lots of people gathered near the iron fences, and I went over. That's when I heard the gunshots.\" Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. \"It took a while for what had happened to sink in,\" he said. \"It wasn't scary while it happened, but now after the event, I'm shaken.\" Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:25 PM Met police say counterterrorism investigation is underway Jack Taylor / Getty Images Commander B.J. Harrington Scotland Yard's Commander B.J. Harrington said the Metropolitan police are remaining open-minded as to the motive at this stage, but that a full counterterrorism investigation is already underway. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. \"We received a number of different reports, which included a person in a river, a car in collision with pedestrians, and a man armed with a knife,\" he said. \"Officers were already in that location as part of routine policing. Immediately additional officers were sent to the scene, as were firearms officers.\" Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. \"Our response will be ongoing for some time and it is important that we gather all possible information and evidence,\" he said. \"Public safety is our top priority and we are reviewing our policing stance across London, and throughout the course of this afternoon there will be additional police and officers deployed across the capital.\" The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee later today, a spokeswoman in Downing Street said. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks.

She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. He said: \"I was walking across Westminster Bridge and a bus stopped right in front of me and everybody started screaming. And I saw a trainer [shoe] in the road, and I thought somebody must have been hit by a car, and then I saw a body on the other side of the road, and then there was another body further up, and then when I looked over the side of the bridge there was another body in the river. \"I didn't see anything. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. \"They were lying face down in the water.\" The BBC later published camera footage of someone falling into the river as a speeding vehicle plows through: The London Ambulance Service Deputy Director of Operations Pauline Cranmer confirmed 10 people were treated by emergency services. \"We can confirm we have treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge and have put a number of hospitals on alert as we continue to respond to this incident,\" he said in a statement. \"We were called at 2.40pm today, with the first ambulance crew arriving within six minutes. \"We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, London's Air Ambulance and our Hazardous Area Response Team. \"We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to ensure patients receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. \"We have declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. \"As we are very busy dealing with this incident, we would ask the public to only call us in a genuine emergency.\" —James Ball Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:42 PM At least one dead and multiple casualties reported One woman has died, according to an anonymous medical source being quoted by multiple media outlets. There are also unconfirmed reports that several people have \"catastrophic injuries\". There have been separate and unconfirmed reports of up to three \"bodies\" on the bridge, including one \"face down in the water\" that have not been confirmed by police. Eyewitnesses, as well as social media accounts, appear to indicate a number of people were seriously hurt on Westminster Bridge. Earlier, a Reuters photographer, Toby Melville, published pictures of four individuals with injuries on the bridge. —Rose Buchanan and Sara Spary Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:35 PM London mayor confirms incidents are being treated as terrorism Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said that the incident is being treated as a terrorist attack until the police know otherwise. \"I have spoken to the Acting Commissioner. The Metropolitan Police Service is dealing with the incident and an urgent investigation is underway. My thoughts are with those affected and their families,\" he said \"I would like to express my thanks to the police and emergency services who work so hard to keep us safe and show tremendous bravery in exceptionally difficult circumstances,\" he added. Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:31 PM Photo shows police officer pointing gun at suspect on the ground This afternoon's Scottish parliament debate has been suspended in light of the incident in Westminster, but the Holyrood parliament has been strongly criticised for how long it took to make the decision. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Inside the chamber, outrage grew that the debate was continuing, with Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser requesting that business was suspended but the deputy presiding officer replying that it would be \"business as usual\". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. However, just before 4pm, presiding officer Ken Macintosh decided to suspend the sitting out of respect for \"our sister parliament\" and added there will be time to resume the debate in future. Davidson tweeted: \"Very pleased that sense has won the day & Holyrood has been suspended until we have a better understanding of what is going on in WM.\" Sturgeon added: \"My thoughts are with everyone in and around Westminster caught up in this dreadful incident – and with the brave emergency services.\" —Jamie Ross Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:02 PM Some MPs and peers have been evacuated from parliament Many politicians inside parliament have been evacuated by armed police, while some other areas remain in lockdown. MP Anna Soubry tweeted that her colleagues were being \"taken out of the library at gun point\" by counterterrorist police. In a statement, the Metropolitan police said: \"Police are asking people to avoid the following areas: Parliament Square; Whitehall; Westminster Bridge; Lambeth Bridge; Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. \"This is to allow the emergency services to deal with the ongoing incident. Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. \"Officers – including firearms officers – remain on the scene and we are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise.\" A police officer was stabbed at Westminster and the attacker was shot by armed police, the leader of the House of Commons said The leader of the House of Commons, David Lidington, has just spoken in parliament and said a police officer was stabbed. He said: \"First of all, colleagues will have appreciated that events have been moving rapidly and I want to emphasise that the knowledge that I have .... is so far very limited. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. \"It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police, an air ambulance is currently attending the scene to remove the casualties. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. \"I shall endeavour to do the very best I can, both at the despatch box and by communicating with my opposite numbers in other political parties to ensure that members are kept aware of what is happening, but at the moment, the very clear advice from the police and the director of security in the house is that we should remain under suspension and that the chamber should remain in lockdown until we receive advice that it is safe to go back to normal procedures.\" —Marie Le Conte Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 15:10 PM This is the scene outside parliament shortly after the incident Phil Han / BuzzFeed News Parliament Square is being closed and cleared, with an emergency helicopter parked in the middle of the area.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/this-is-the-man-behind-the-westminster-attack?utm_term=.yjlNygayn","text":"Khalid Masood, the man who attacked parliament this week, was born Adrian Elms in Dartford, Kent, on Christmas Day in 1964. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. Masood had been investigated “some years ago” as part of an investigation into violent extremism, prime minister Theresa May told MPs on Thursday. But despite a history of violent criminal offences he was only ever seen as \"peripheral\" in historical terror investigations. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. A former intelligence official told BuzzFeed News: \"The service had him as an SOI [subject of interest] a few years ago but think he didn't meet the threshold for investigation so was not investigated further.\" They added: \"My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he's acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint.\" Metropolitan police Khalid Masood The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \"Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.” Masood’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. In 2000, while living in the village of Northiam, Sussex, Masood, still known then as Elms, was convicted for slashing a man’s face after an argument in a pub. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott. This was a long time ago. I remember Elms being a bit of a troubled character.” Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News The block of flats where Masood lived most recently in Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham. A next-door neighbour who gave her name as Iwona, 45, said he had lived there for seven months. \"I am really surprised, I cannot believe it, I cannot believe it,” she told BuzzFeed News. “As I said, when I saw him I couldn't even think someone could do something like this. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. “Sometimes in the afternoon I saw him taking care of the garden, washing the car, and he was very calm.\" Iwona described the woman he lived with there as being in her thirties and said she wore \"Islamic clothing\". The neighbour said she hadn't seen Masood for a few months and that he just \"took a van and went\". Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. \"The family moved quickly and took their things out of the garage,\" Iwona said. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News Masood's neighbour Iwona at her flat in Quayside, Birmingham. Another neighbour, who gave her name as Sam, said: “He moved out in December and I never really spoke to him. I didn't know his name before. “He had a little boy who was 5 years old. There was a woman – I didn't know if it was his wife or daughter. We’d just say hello in the street.” It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Department for Education said Masood never held qualified status as a teacher, but according to The Sun newspaper he claimed on his CV to have an economics degree and to be a “senior English teacher” at a TEFL college in Luton in 2009. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, the prime minister confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”. Echoing police, she said the “working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology”. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. “He was just like any other guest who checks into the hotel,\" he said. \"We had a brief conversation about where he came from in Birmingham. “He talked about his family, his mum, his dad, his wife. He said his dad was ill and his mum was upset.” Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. Huntleys School website “I am really, really shocked. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. The picture of us in the football team was after we did a 24-hour sponsored football match to raise money for the sports hall,” said Stuart Knight, who went to school with Masood, to TheGuardian. “We would have been about 14 years old. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge (in Missoni) and Prince Harry arrive after laying a wreath at Westminster Abbey in London. ANDY RAIN/EPA/REX/Shutterstock FRESH MEMORY: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined Prince Harry at a ceremony on Wednesday to honor the victims of the terrorist attack in London last month. The incident, which took place outside the Palace of Westminster, and on the nearby bridge, saw five people killed, including the perpetrator, and 50 injured. The Westminster Underground station remained shut that day, and government buildings were in lock down as police dealt with the victims on Westminster bridge, and outside the Houses of Parliament. Victims and their families, alongside the police, NHS hospital workers, fire brigade and ambulance teams took part in the service. About 2,000 people attended the multifaith ceremony, called Service of Hope, which was aired on BBC One TV. After hymns were sung, Britain’s Home Secretary Amber Rudd read a passage from the Book of Jeremiah. Prince William took to the pulpit and recited the parable of the Good Samaritan from Luke 10:25–37 in the Bible. Kate Middleton wore a gray and white Missoni coat, the same one she donned for the Somme Vigil in France last year.

Nils Jorgensen/REX/Shutterstock The victims of the attack were Aysha Frade, who worked at a London college; Kurt Cochran, a tourist from Utah, Leslie Rhodes, from south London; and PC Keith Palmer. The attacker, Khalid Masood, was shot and killed by police. Two male suspects were taken into custody that evening, while seven were released by police. A woman was arrested in Manchester, then released on bail, while another woman was arrested in east London, and also released on bail. London’s Metropolitan Police said they have seized 2,700 items during their investigation, including “massive amounts of computer data.” The attack started when Masood drove his car over Westminster Bridge, hitting and injuring a number of members of the public, also including three police officers who were on their way back from a commendation ceremony. After the car crashed into railings, Masood continued his rampage and tried to enter Parliament, killing a police officer with a knife. Police believe he acted alone. On Tuesday, the duchess attended opening night of the “42nd Street Musical” that stars Sheena Easton at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane in London’s Covent Garden. Produced by David Merrick and directed by Gower Champion, the West End play originally debuted on Broadway in 1980. In 1984, it debuted at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane and starred Catherine Zeta Jones. The production raised funds for the Nook Appeal, an initiative under EACH, where the duchess is a patron.
