This strike at parliament took aim directly at the heart of British democracy. It was perhaps meant to reach the prime minister – for today, the day of prime minister’s questions, was the one day when her movements would be well known – but more probably it was, like the attack in Berlin just before Christmas, simply an attempt to hit at a European centre of power. The earlier car attack on the dozens of tourists and office workers and three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony, caught walking across Westminster Bridge around 2.45pm, was plainly intended to magnify the terror. This is the moment that everyone planned for and hoped would never happen, the Metropolitan police acting deputy commissioner, Mark Rowley, said at his first news conference afterwards. It was also the hardest kind of attack to stop, an apparently lone terrorist using low-tech weaponry seeking to do maximum harm, almost certain of death himself. He got through, but a dozen or more attacks have been foiled in Britain since 2013, 10 of them in the past two years. More than 500 live counter-terror investigations are under way at any given moment, Mr Rowley said recently. The police and the security forces have to be right all the time. The terrorists only need to be lucky once. It is important to hold on to that truth, and to remember that, terrible as the loss of life has been and grim as the aftermath will be, no one would want to live in the kind of world where such an attack had been made entirely impossible. The security forces acted swiftly and courageously to protect parliament and the public. For the families of the dead, and for the injured, this is a horrendous, life-changing event. The shock and distress of eyewitnesses, trapped on buses or simply walking along the pavement, was evident in their voices and their faces as they spoke to reporters. Some of them behaved with impressive presence of mind, including the foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood, who tried to revive the fatally injured policeman. The security forces and police have planned for what they call a “marauding attack” for years. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace. There will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates, but for now, there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job. What now? We often mock our political class, but it is worth remembering that being an MP has never been risk-free. In 1979, the IRA murdered the senior Tory MP Airey Neave with a car bomb only yards from where today’s attack took place. An MP died in the Brighton bomb in 1984, and another was murdered at his home in 1990. Last June, Jo Cox died at the hands of a rightwing extremist, Thomas Mair, as she made her way to her constituency surgery. Security at parliament is tighter than it has ever been. Its one obvious weakness was the main vehicle entrance into New Palace Yard, off the road linking Whitehall with other government offices. This is the very heart of government. It’s where tourists stand taking selfies through the open gates of the place that is still regarded around the world as the birthplace of modern democracy. Today’s attack has long been anticipated. It is not an act of war. It must not be allowed to divide us one from the other. Terror’s purpose is to spread hate and division. The first protection against it must be solidarity.","title":"The Guardian view on the Westminster attack: solidarity against terror | Editorial | Opinion | The

It’s like that bit in Mean Girls where the girl makes a histrionic speech in front of the whole school and the guy at the back says: “She doesn’t even go here!?” “Liberals in London,” Katie also declared, “actually think multiculturalism means we all die together.” Um, you don’t even go here!? YOU LIVE IN DEVON, MATE. I’m not going to say where, because it’s not fair to cause a house price crash (and her exact location may be covered by some sort of Shitness Protection Programme). Still, even as the police urge caution on the Westminster attack, Katie’s intemperate intervention serves as a reminder that where some people see tragedy, others see tragitunity. “No anger for me this time,” wrote Katie. “No rage like I’ve felt before. No desperate urge to get out there and scream at the idiots who refused to see this coming.” There was, however, a desperate urge to get booked on Fox News. And since this is a showbusiness column, may I congratulate Katie and her publicist in pulling the gig off this time. Katie seems marginally more frantic to break America than even Robbie Williams once was. The problem is that Over There hardly lacks for its own supply of reactionary wingnuts. And with a protectionist president openly demanding a return to American-made goods and services, a foreign purveyor of discord will only be first choice in rare situations. Katie knows there are only going to be a few times a news producer is going to call her instead of Ann Coulter. The Westminster attack is one of them. Consequently, we are in what Katie and her agent may well regard as a golden window. These are the hours and days you need to make count. She wants that phone ringing off the hook. She wants to graduate from Tucker Carlson to helping Sean Hannity talk about anything but Trump and the FBI. Deep down, she wants a Vanity Fair cover saying “The Alt-right Brits Are Coming”, in which she and Nigel Farage are in bed like Patsy and Liam were. To read Katie Hopkins is to know that she would have disagreed with the Enlightenment if she thought there was a Loose Women appearance in it. She writes like a not-very-bright sixth former trying to ape the prose style of Tony Parsons – no argument, just a portentous moodboard. Her Westminster article reads like a series of Google calendar reminders to herself. “Shots fired. An Asian man rushed to hospital. And I grew colder. And more tiny.” Here she is on the rest of the country’s relationship with London: “We are taken under the cold water by this heavy right foot in the south, a city of lead …” Oof. Prose of lead. The concrete shoe of no verbs. Too many. Staccato sentences. Passing for gravitas. In fact, having performed a highly scientific linguistic analysis, I can confirm Katie uses fewer active verbs than even Tony Blair or John Keats. Presumably it’s because she really doesn’t have anywhere to go, philosophically. Still, were Katie on hand now, I expect she would retort that what we say is more important than how we say it. In fact, I know she would, because it wasn’t long ago that she said the diametric opposite. “The thing that would hurt me,” she told an interviewer, “is if people suggested that I was bad at writing.” For now, it falls to her to explain London to the Americans. “Londoners can’t even be honest about these attacks,” she told Fox News. “Because it would mean everything they believed in was false.” Ah, the false idols of the decadent metropolis! Had Katie spent more than 10 minutes in the World History aisle of Wikipedia, she would know there have always been people who hated cities for what they stood for. The metropolis has at many times served as shorthand for a kind of moral decay and wicked permissiveness that requires (usually forcible) regression. “This place where monsters lurk and steal lives away in an instant,” thunders Katie of the capital’s wickedness. “For nothing.” Dear, dear – it does all seem rather terminal. I wonder what Katie would do with the failed, corruptive experiment that is London? The Khmer Rouge decided that the only solution was to empty the cities, and send their suspiciously educated denizens to the countryside. Come Katie’s revolution, perhaps Londoners will be forcibly migrated too. Yes, in a sledgehammer irony that will nonetheless have escaped her, Abu Hopkins detests the liberalism of the city. A serial preacher of hate, she speaks of humans as cockroaches, and of non-military matters in terms of struggle and war. “We stand divided,” she tweeted at Sadiq Khan, “cowed by your religion.” She now seeks to demonise London among her faithful, calling for an end to its degenerate values in the most apocalyptic terms she can muster. Fortunately – and I hardly need to state this – she will get about as far with such smallness as she will with breaking America. Devon’s loss remains the capital’s gain. For all the tragedies and assaults enfolded into its history, London is a city that will never be so defeated as to have the time to explain itself to Katie Hopkins.","title":"Look out, America!

The 32-year-old woman was arrested in Manchester last week, two days after Masood's deadly attack which claimed the life of four victims, including police constable Keith Palmer outside the Palace of Westminster on March 22. She was detained on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act on March 24, and released on Thursday afternoon. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham remains in custody after an application for extended detention under the Terrorism Act 2000 on March 27. Ten other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have been released without further action. The inquest into the deaths of victims who died during the attack was opened and adjourned at the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday March 29, and a provisional date for the pre-inquest review has been set for May 19.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.hertsad.co.uk/news/more_police_greater_vigilance_and_silence_st_albans_after_the_westminster_attack_1_4944386","text":"There will be an “enhanced” police presence around train stations and St Albans after the attack on Parliament yesterday. Herts Police and British Transport Police have said they are increasing patrols, after four people were killed in a terrorist attack at Westminster. Herts Police said: “Whilst there is no specific threat to the county, Hertfordshire Constabulary, in line with the rest of the police service across the UK, continues to work to protect and reassure our communities, as well as taking sensible measures to enhance the security of police officers given the recent tragic incident in London. “Our response includes a strong visible police presence across the county, to provide reassurance to all communities and to protect the public from harm.” Both forces have paid tribute to those who died. Herts Police and St Albans district council have held a minute’s silence today. Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, Daisy Cooper, who was at Parliament during the attack, was told to run by masked police officers after the attack started. She said: “I was in the Lords giving a presentation at 2pm. “When I left I was told I couldn’t leave corridor as there had been a shooting outside. “We tried to go to the cafe and all rooms by river were evacuated. We were herded towards central lobby. “At one point armed masked police men ran in and told us to run so we ran up the stairs “We were then told to come down quickly and were herded into central lobby.” She said there were hundreds of journalists, MPs, visitors and staff stuffed into the lobby, being given water in rationed amounts. The police eventually allowed them to leave at just before 8pm. Ms Cooper has lavished praise on the police for their response to the crisis. She said: “Police response inside Westminster was very quick, controlled and effective. “An event like today’s should I hope encourage more people to stand up. “The more diverse our parliament becomes the more we undermine extremist rhetoric.” A few years back I was fixing a shed in our garden and had enlisted the help of my young son. We were busy moving rotten pieces of wood from the side of the shed when suddenly I felt sharp stabbing pains in my lower legs. Before I had a chance to investigate my son started screaming in pain and it took a few more seconds to realize that we were trampling on a wasps’ nest!","title":"More police, greater vigilance, and

How many times is this? Or is there no point in counting? The places are too familiar, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Nice, to name a few. And now London. This time it felt a little closer to home, a few months ago I stood in the exact spot it happened and watched the joy of a cycling event in front of me. The center point of one of the greatest nations on Earth is soaked in the blood of innocents. It feels like it has gotten to a point where the idea of people ramming vehicles into crowds of innocent bystanders has become accepted and tolerated as sort of the norm, but it shouldn’t be. We shouldn’t have to take terrorism into account when we plan vacations to places like Europe. Attacks like this aren’t just something we have to live with. For the sake of us ALL, we cannot let this become the new normal. The solutions might be confusing, they might anger people, they might make people think we are being counterproductive, but a solution must be followed. And the solution won’t be as easy as “throw ’em out” or “take them all in”. Issues like this are complex, with roots in conflicts that are hundreds of years old. No solution will be easy, but one must be found. Stifling conversations that are “too hard to have” is only going to make our problems worse, and yelling at each other won’t fix it either. We have to take a proactive approach to working out the solutions to this, even if it hurts a little. Or a lot. This is one of our generation’s biggest fights. We can’t sit around and watch things like this happen, offer our thoughts and prayers, change the color of the Eiffel Tower for a night, and sit around until the next one happens. Every one of these attacks should be treated like what they are: affronts against humanity. Whatever solutions we follow, no matter what steps we take, there is one thing we cannot do: We cannot let this become the new normal. Advertisements Share this: Like this: LikeLoading...

He said it was possible that her current opinion poll lead could narrow over the campaign. Speaking on BBC News, Curtice said: “We should bear in mind that Theresa May is very much going for a ‘vote Conservative for my vision of Brexit’. And that perhaps is going to make some Conservative voters unhappy. If that lead were to narrow then we could discover that she is back with a rather smaller majority than perhaps she is hoping for.” But Curtice added: “The Labour party is at sixes and sevens on its stance on Brexit. There are divisions inside the Conservative party but the opposition is probably even more divided on the subject and she’s probably banking that so long as this remains the central issue, the Labour party will not be capable of fighting an effective alternative position.” We still have not had a response from Labour to Theresa May’s announcement, but this is from the Green party’s co-leader, Caroline Lucas. Britain is at a crossroads – and today’s announcement means that people are rightly given a say over the direction this country is going to take. Only the Green party offers a bold, positive vision for a different kind of Britain. At this election we will stand for an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few; a Britain that’s open to the world and the protection of our precious environment. We will stand up to the politics of hatred and division that is scarring our communities and give people across the country a chance to vote for a better Britain. Theresa May's statement I have just chaired a meeting of the cabinet, where we agreed that the government should call a general election, to be held on June 8. I want to explain the reasons for that decision, what will happen next and the choice facing the British people when you come to vote in this election. Last summer, after the country voted to leave the European Union, Britain needed certainty, stability and strong leadership, and since I became prime minister the government has delivered precisely that. Despite predictions of immediate financial and economic danger, since the referendum we have seen consumer confidence remain high, record numbers of jobs, and economic growth that has exceeded all expectations. We have also delivered on the mandate that we were handed by the referendum result. Britain is leaving the European Union and there can be no turning back. And as we look to the future, the government has the right plan for negotiating our new relationship with Europe. We want a deep and special partnership between a strong and successful European Union and a United Kingdom that is free to chart its own way in the world. That means we will regain control of our own money, our own laws and our own borders and we will be free to strike trade deals with old friends and new partners all around the world. This is the right approach, and it is in the national interest. But the other political parties oppose it. At this moment of enormous national significance there should be unity here in Westminster, but instead there is division. The country is coming together, but Westminster is not. In recent weeks Labour has threatened to vote against the deal we reach with the European Union. The Liberal Democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standstill. The Scottish National party say they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals Britain’s membership of the European Union. And unelected members of the House of Lords have vowed to fight us every step of the way. Our opponents believe that because the government’s majority is so small, our resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course. They are wrong. They underestimate our determination to get the job done and I am not prepared to let them endanger the security of millions of working people across the country. Because what they are doing jeopardises the work we must do to prepare for Brexit at home and it weakens the government’s negotiating position in Europe. If we do not hold a general election now their political game-playing will continue, and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election. Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country. So we need a general election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin. I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion. Since I became prime minister I have said that there should be no election until 2020, but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take. And so tomorrow I will move a motion in the House of Commons calling for a general election to be held on the eighth of June. That motion, as set out by the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, will require a two-thirds majority of the House of Commons. So I have a simple challenge to the opposition parties, you have criticised the government’s vision for Brexit, you have challenged our objectives, you have threatened to block the legislation we put before parliament. This is your moment to show you mean it, to show you are not opposing the government for the sake of it, to show that you do not treat politics as a game. Let us tomorrow vote for an election, let us put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programmes for government and then let the people decide. And the decision facing the country will be all about leadership. It will be a choice between strong and stable leadership in the national interest, with me as your prime minister, or weak and unstable coalition government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, propped up by the Liberal Democrats - who want to reopen the divisions of the referendum - and Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. Every vote for the Conservatives will make it harder for opposition politicians who want to stop me from getting the job done. Every vote for the Conservatives will make me stronger when I negotiate for Britain with the prime ministers, presidents and chancellors of the European Union. Every vote for the Conservatives means we can stick to our plan for a stronger Britain and take the right long-term decisions for a more secure future. It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond. So, tomorrow, let the House of Commons vote for an election, let everybody put forward their proposals for Brexit and their programmes for government, and let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability and continue to give the country the strong and stable leadership it demands. Here are some of the things Theresa May has said in the past about ruling out an early election. Just before she assumed the role of prime minister she said there would be no early election under her leadership. On 30 June, in the speech that launched her bid, she explicitly ruled it out. Then in her first major interview after taking office, she told the Andrew Marr Show last September that the UK needed a period of stability after the shock Brexit vote. She said: “I’m not going to be calling a snap election. I’ve been very clear that I think we need that period of time, that stability, to be able to deal with the issues that the country is facing and have that election in 2020.” She said: “Of course, the referendum laid bare some further divisions in our country – between those who are prospering, and those who are not … those for whom our country works well, and those for whom it does not. “As the fantastic MP Jo Cox, who was so tragically taken from us last year, put it: ‘We are far more united and have far more in common than that which divides us.’”","title":"Poll suggests voters back

{"originalUrl":"http://www.france24.com/en/20170324-british-police-make-more-arrests-connection-with-westminster-attack?utm_source=breakingnews.center","text":"British police said Friday they had made two further “significant” arrests over the Islamist-inspired terror attack on parliament, as they appealed for information about the homegrown killer who left four people dead. Nine people are now in custody over Wednesday’s rampage in Westminster, in which at least 50 people were injured, 31 requiring hospital treatment, counter-terrorism commander Mark Rowley said. Police have searched 16 addresses, with five more raids still underway, mainly in London and the central city of Birmingham, where the attacker reportedly lived and near where he rented the car used in the assault. The police officer also revealed the attacker’s birth name as Adrian Russell Ajao, after naming him Thursday as Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old who used “a number of aliases” and had a history of violent offences but no terrorist convictions. The Islamic State group claimed the assailant behind Britain’s deadliest terror attack in 12 years was one of its “soldiers” acting on a call to target countries in the US-led coalition fighting the jihadists. Prime Minister Theresa May has said that Masood was known to intelligence services as a “peripheral” figure some years ago but there was no warning of his intention to mount an attack. Rowley said Friday that police were trying to establish whether Masood acted totally alone “or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him”. Masood ran over dozens of pedestrians and tourists on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon before crashing his car into parliament, where he managed to stab a police officer before being shot dead. Lawmakers returned to work as normal on Thursday morning, even as forensic officers worked at the scene, but a review of parliamentary security is now underway. Hundreds of people gathered in nearby Trafalgar Square late Thursday for a vigil led by Mayor Sadiq Khan who vowed that “Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.” Numerous aliases The death toll rose late Thursday after life support was withdrawn from a 75-year-old man injured in the attack, whom police named as Leslie Rhodes from south London. The other victims were 48-year-old policeman Keith Palmer and, on the bridge, a 43-year-old British woman, Aysha Frade, who was on her way to pick up her two daughters, and an American citizen in his 50s, Kurt Cochran. Police earlier said that five men and three women aged between 21 and 58 were arrested “on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts”. One woman was later released on bail. Rowley gave no details of the new arrests, only to say that they took place in the West Midlands the area of the country that includes Birmingham and the north-west of England. Born in Kent in southeast England, Masood was a British citizen with convictions for assault and possession of offensive weapons dating from 1983 to 2003. According to The Sun tabloid, he married a Muslim woman in 2004 and moved the following year to Saudi Arabia to teach, returning in 2009. Police said he went by numerous aliases, including, reportedly, Adrian Elms, while reports suggest he lived all over England, including in Luton and east London. He was described as “a nice guy” by Iwona Romek, a former neighbour in Birmingham, who told the Birmingham Mail: “He had a wife, a young Asian woman and a small child who went to school.” Rowley said police were “looking at his history” and appealed for any public information about him, adding: “Our investigation focuses on understanding his motivation, preparation and associates.” The crowds at Trafalgar Square late Thursday brought messages of defiance, flags and flowers, and offered their condolences to officers who lost a colleague in the attack. Naveed Mirza, a Muslim student, said he had received “overwhelming” support since the attack described by police as “Islamist-related terrorism”. “We have come to say how, as Muslims, we unequivocally condemn all the violent actions that took place yesterday,” he told AFP. First IS claim of British attack The IS group said it was responsible, according to the Amaq propaganda agency, its first claim of an attack on British soil. The latest attack had echoes of the atrocities in Nice and Berlin when trucks ploughed into crowds of people, killing 86 people in the French Riviera city in July and 12 at a market in the German capital just days before Christmas. The assault on Westminster was the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city’s transport system in July 2005. A defiant May had told the reopened parliament that Britain’s resolve “will never waver in the face of terrorism,” as MPs stood heads bowed for a minute’s silence in remembrance of the victims. Britain’s last terror attack was the 2016 assassination of MP Jo Cox by a pro-Nazi sympathiser shortly before the historic but deeply divisive June vote to leave the EU.In 2013, British soldier Lee Rigby was run down and knifed on a London street to death by two Islamist extremists.","title":"British police make two more arrests in connection with Westminster attack - France

{"originalUrl":"http://thetruthseekersguide.blogspot.com/2017/03/attack-at-westminster-322.html?spref=tw","text":"Wednesday, 22 March 2017 Attack at Westminster & 322 Today, an incident unfolded in Westminster in London that the BBC are currently describing as a “terrorist incident” and an “Attack at Westminster”. Here is the official account currently posted on the BBC’s website as of approximately 6pm the same day. “A police officer and a woman have been killed near Parliament in central London in what Scotland Yard are treating as a terrorist incident. The woman was among several pedestrians struck by a car on Westminster Bridge, before it crashed into railings. An officer was stabbed in the Houses of Parliament by an attacker, who was shot by police. Police said there were \"a number of casualties\" and a \"full counter-terrorism inquiry\" was under way. Writing on Twitter, BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said it is understood from multiple sources that two people were in the vehicle on the bridge.”http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39355940At the time of writing this, few other details about the incident have been disclosed. At present, a single individual has been described as being responsible for the incident. It appears that this individual was shot dead. There has been some speculation that a second individual may have been involved in some manner. At present, the identity of the dead individual nor any details about the individual’s possible motives have been announced. My thoughts are with those innocent bystanders who have been traumatized or injured during this incident. My thoughts and deepest sympathies also go out to the loved ones of those people who have lost their lives as a result of the incident today. My regular readers will know that I have, from time to time, written on this blog about “terrorist incidents” that have taken place throughout recent years. I have no wish to trivialise the events of today, nor do I wish to engage at this point in a lengthy discourse about the alternative nature of certain similar incidents that have taken place in recent times. I will leave that subject for another day. However, I have learned that there are times when it is vital to be observant and vigilant when certain events take place. It is an unbelievably important lesson from history that we never take information that is conveyed to us by the media on blind, face value. An irresponsible observer is one who does not scrutinise all they see and are told. Equally so when we do not ask questions. Please keep this in mind as we are told more about the events in Westminster and we observe the subsequent reactions of those in positions of authority. Moving on…I’m not sure how many people will have noticed, but today is, aside from the tragic events in London, a very important day for those people in the world with certain “belief systems”. Today is 322. More accurately, it is March 22nd. 322 is considered a hugely significant number in certain occult and esoteric circles. Amongst its many diverse associations, 322 is perhaps best known to alternative knowledge researchers as the numerical “emblem” of the Skull and Bones society. Although many men of power and wealth have moved through the ranks of Skull and Bones, its most high profile member is undoubtedly George W Bush. Although some people will remember him for a myriad of reasons, most will remember Bush Jnr as the American president who presided over the US during the events of 9/11 and the formative years of the subsequent Western-led “War on Terror”. Above and beyond the many tragic events that have happened in the last decade and a half, 9/11 is remembered as the most devastating to have been declared a “terrorist” attack. Of course, compelling and exhaustive evidence analysing the events of 9/11 - such as that assembled by Dr Judy Wood in her book “Where Did the Towers Go?” – shows that what really happened that day does not match the “official narrative” that the public were told about 9/11. It is that evidence, and inconsistencies about other subsequent events like 7/7, that has given many people justifiable reason to pay extra attention whenever such events - deemed of a “terrorist” nature - unfold. But back to 322… Historically, March 20 - 22 has been dedicated to the Goddess Ostara. March 20th 2017 celebrates the High Feast of Ostara and is also the Spring Equinox - often dedicated to the worship of the Mother Earth Goddess Gaia. March 21 is allegedly, according to certain sources, one of the Illuminati's \"Human Sacrifice Nights.\" March 22nd 2017 is also the Ceremony of Hilaria - an Ancient Roman rite given to \"rejoicing and public sacrifices [...] the eve of that day they spent in tears and lamentations [...] The day of its celebration was the first after the vernal equinox, or the first day of the year which was longer than the night. The winter with its gloom had passed away, and the first day of a better season was spent in rejoicings [...] All kinds of games and amusements were allowed on this day; masquerades were the most prominent among them, and everyone might, in his disguise, imitate whomsoever he liked, and even magistrates.\" The date is also curious for an assassination plot that took in Ancient Rome. \"Maternus against Emperor Commodus [...] planned to disguise himself and his followers as members of the Praetorian Guard, and proceed among the true members of the Guard, until they were close enough to kill Commodus. However, one of Maternus's followers revealed the plot ahead of time...\" http://pagancalendar.co.uk/event.php?zodiac=astrological&getdate=20170322&tz=Europe/London&id=1098322 coincides with Uttara Ashadha Nakshatra - indicative of sun symbolism, the \"birth star\" and the creation of powerful energy. It also represents the first day of the 40 Day \"Season of Human Sacrifice\", the completion of the three-day process of resurrection from death. The Season of Human Sacrifice will conclude on April 30th 2017 - which is Beltane Eve (often celebrated with bonfires and fertility rites) and considered to be one of the most crucial occult dates in the annual calendar. We are currently seeing trailers for Ridley Scott's \"Prometheus\" movie \"Alien: Covenant\". A few weeks ago, a provisional release date for the film was cited, by certain sources, as April 30th. It is now being stated as May 19th. The original \"Prometheus\" was first shown to the public in Paris on April 11th 2012 - smack bang in the centre of the \"40 Day Season of Human Sacrifice\". Both \"Prometheus\" and, from what we have seen in the film trailer, \"Alien: Covenant\" contain ritualistic sacrifices of innocent humans. \"Prometheus\" is loaded with 322 symbolism - most notably the inverted name of the planet LV-223, which director Ridley Scott described (on the DVD commentary for the film) rather cryptically as a “very romantic codename”. \"Prometheus\" is also awash with symbols and themes relating to Saturn worship - another purveyor of ritual and mortal sacrifice. But I digress a little...On March 22nd 2017 (322), the \"Attack on Westminster\" took place. According to several early sources, the assailant allegedly responsible for the events was shot by police at 2.30pm. A number of witnesses heard 3 shots being fired. One of the London \"Red\" buses photographed on the Westminster Bridge after the event was the 211. For much of the afternoon, the BBC has been airing helicopter footage of the Westminster Bridge cordoned off. From the time on the Big Ben clock face, we can see this footage was filmed at 3.20pm. The overhead footage clearly shows the two principle lane/direction signs painted on the road. One directs for the A302, the other for the A3211. These are the only road numbers shown on the road surface of Westminster Bridge in the footage. A minister in the House of Commons announced the events in Westminster to his fellow house members at exactly 3pm. Finally, Westminster is located in W1. W is the 23rd letter of the English alphabet. March 22nd 2017 (322) is, to the day, the one year anniversary of the Brussels \"terrorist attack\".Maybe this is all coincidental... maybe not. I will leave it for you to decide.If nothing else, please remember always to be mindful and observant - especially right now.The Truth Seeker's Guide.Books available from Carl James:Science Fiction and the Hidden Global Agenda - Volume One - http://www.lulu.com/shop/carl-james/science-fiction-and-the-hidden-global-agenda-2016-edition-volume-one/paperback/product-23209429.htmlScience Fiction and the Hidden Global Agenda - Volume Two - http://www.lulu.com/shop/carl-james/science-fiction-and-the-hidden-global-agenda-2016-edition-volume-two/paperback/product-23209433.htmlWhat Really Happened at the London 2012 Olympics - http://www.lulu.com/shop/carl-james/what-really-happened-at-the-london-2012-olympics/paperback/product-23221527.html 3 comments: Hi Carl Another very interesting post my friend.

Hassell was at the centre of a legal case earlier this year after she refused to prioritise her work on religious grounds. People claiming they were sexually abused by priests filed a class action lawsuit on Monday against eight dioceses in Pennsylvania seeking to compel them to divulge the names of priests accused of such actions over the past 70 years.

Two couples are seeking to overturn a ruling that the prohibition does not breach their human rights under European law. A Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP has said his party will not secularise the education system after he fought to defer a motion calling for the end of Catholic schools at the party's conference last weekend. On Thursday an American bishop in West Virginia was brought down by allegations of sexual misconduct, even as a delegation of American church leaders met urgently with the pope over whether the Vatican had ignored past warnings of abuse by a prominent cardinal. Thu, 13 Sep 2018 Nearly a third of middle-class, professional parents personally know someone who has used \"ethically dubious\" tactics to get their children into a good school, a new report has found.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/27/armed-police-westminster-arrest-man-backpack-knives/?WT.mc_id=tmgliveapp_androidshare_AmVYVhghCXpn","text":"The 27-year-old man, dressed head to toe in black, was wrestled to the ground by armed police officers as he walked among a crowd of tourists and workers in Parliament Street at just after 2.20pm yesterday. His arrest came just five weeks - and a 100 yards away - from the spot where Khalid Masood was shot and killed within the grounds of the Palace of Westminster, having mowed down bystanders in a hired car driven over Westminster Bridge. The Telegraph understands that the man, who is understood to have been born overseas but who lives in south east London, was known to the security services and was being watched as part of an ongoing counter-terrorism operation. The suspect was detained at the scene for several minutes within view of journalists and passers by before he was eventually taken away in a police vehicle. Recruiters Harry Peasnell, 27, and Andy Burnage, 22, were leaving the adjacent building which houses various Government offices after a meeting with officials when they were told over the tannoy the usual entrance on to Whitehall was closed. As they made their way back towards Parliament from the alternative House Guards Road entrance they said they were pushed back up Great George Street by several plain clothes police officers. They then made their way to Parliament Square where they said they saw a man in his 20s or 30s, who they thought was the suspect, being spoken to by police next to the wall of the offices. Mr Peasnell, who says he regularly has meetings in Westminster, said police were \"quick on the scene\" and that he was not worried like he was during the terror attack in the area just weeks ago. \"Last time all the buildings were on lockdown and no one was allowed to leave,\" he said. Westminster has been on a state of heightened alert since Masood launched his attack on March 22, killing five people, including Pc Keith Palmer. First test for new Met chief The successful arrest is the first real test for Cressida Dick, the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who previously - and notoriously - had been in charge of the operation that led to the death of the innocent Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes who was mistaken for a terrorist when he was shot on the London Underground in July 2005. Ms Dick briefed London mayor Sadiq Khan on yesterday’s arrest. A spokesman for the mayor said: “Mr Khan is hugely grateful to the police for their swift, decisive and professional actions. He is hugely relieved there have been no casualties.” Reports suspect's family tipped off police Another eyewitness has described what she saw Helen Chandler Wilde told the BBC: \"I saw a couple of police officers with a guy interviewing him and then putting him in a car as well as a couple of police forensics officers photographing the scene. \"And I did see the knives on the floor with the brown backpack lying next to it which was in the middle of the intersection in Whitehall. \"I didn't see the guy, you know, being put on the floor by the police, so all I can imagine is that he was stopped there and dropped his things and then was taken to the other side of the road just outside the Treasury to be arrested and questioned which is where I saw him \"I'd say there were a dozen or two dozen [police officers] kind of spread out around Westminster and Parliament Square. \"He had his head low, his hood still up of his black hoodie, trying to hide his face from police, I don't know, but from photographs he appeared to be smirking. \"[People were] remarkably not scared at all, not worried, the road was shut off but only just, still on the other side of the road there were people on the bus stuck in traffic on the way home just like any normal day, there were even a couple of tourists coming up to me thinking the Queen was coming to visit because the road was shut. I had to disappoint them there.\" Full quote from Theresa May Theresa May said: \"It shows that our police and intelligence and security services are on the alert, as they always are, looking to keep us safe and secure. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to these people, many of whom are unseen, unheard, yet the job they do day in, day out to keep us secure is a really important one and we should thank them for it.\" Theresa May kept in the loop Prime Minister Theresa May was away from Number 10 on a campaign visit at the time of the incident, which did not disrupt work in Downing Street, said a spokeswoman. \"This is an ongoing police operation and we are monitoring it,\" said the Number 10 spokeswoman. \"The Prime Minister has been informed by officials and she will be updated, as usual for incidents like this.\" Heightened security at Westminster The latest security incident comes after Westminster was put on a heightened state of alert following a major terror attack just over a month ago. Khalid MasoodCredit: PA Security in the area has been noticeably more high profile since Khalid Masood killed four people by ramming them with his car on Westminster Bridge before stabbing to death Pc Keith Palmer just inside the grounds of Parliament on March 22. In the aftermath of the assault, authorities have reviewed how to keep the area as safe as possible. Armed police officers have been more visible patrolling the Palace of Westminster since the attack, which also left Masood dead from gunshot injuries. Incident treated as 'terrorism' Scotland Yard has released this statement confirming the incident is being treated as a suspected terror attack: A man has been arrested in Whitehall this afternoon, at approximately 14:22, following a stop and search as part of an ongoing operation. The man was arrested in Parliament Street, junction with Parliament Square, by armed officers from the Met’s Specialist Firearms Command. The man, aged in his late twenties, was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Knives have been recovered from him. He is being detained under the Terrorism Act and is in custody in a south London police station. Detectives from the Counter Terrorism Command are continuing their investigation, and as a result of this arrest there is no immediate known threat.","title":"Whitehall incident: Westminster attack

{"originalUrl":"http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/15174606.Terror_attack_at_Westminster__Worcestershire_MPs_caught_up_in_lockdown_after_knifeman_s_rampage/","text":"A TERROR attack has rocked Westminster - with a crazed knifeman running over pedestrians in a car and stabbing a police officer before being shot dead. Several Worcestershire MPs were held on lockdown inside the Commons as today's horrifying terror incident unfolded. Former Worcester Labour MP Mike Foster was also at Westminster today and was told by armed police to leave the area for his own safety. The attacker mowed down people on Westminster Bridge before smashing his car into railings, running through gates at the front of parliament and stabbing a police officer. He then tried to enter the building, where hundreds of MPs were gathered, but was shot several times by armed police as he approached a second officer at 2.45pm. It left a trail of destruction, with victims strewn across the bridge and up to a dozen gunshots heard by witnesses amid the chaos. Some county MPs, including Mid-Worcestershire's Nigel Huddleston and Wyre Forest MP Mark Garnier, were put on lockdown in the chamber as police dealt with the aftermath outside. The staff of all six Worcestershire MP's also locked themselves in their offices as police scrambled to close off roads, before the palaces were evacuated. By 10.45pm this evening four people had died, including the stabbed officer and two pedestrians run over at Westminster Bridge, but police said many more have suffered \"catastrophic\" injuries, with the toll set to rise. The dead police officer was named as Keith Palmer, 48, a dad and husband with more than 15 years experience in the job. The Met Police released a statement saying \"at least\" 20 people were seriously injured. One woman jumped into the River Thames to avoid the attacker's 4x4 as it drove at her, and is expected to survive after being rescued from the water and taken to hospital. Mr Huddleston said: \"Most MPs were in the chamber at the time we heard the news - my staff are all safe and had locked themselves into my office. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the injured police officer and everyone on Westminster Bridge.\" Some MPs also described how armed military-style police stormed sections of the building. Mr Garnier said: \"There were quite a lot of impressive looking blokes in body armour with machine guns - it was very reassuring, given the circumstances.\" Worcester MP Robin Walker, who is in Brussels today, said: \"I'm very shocked and very saddened by what's happened.\" West Worcestershire MP Harriett Baldwin, who is in Malaysia doing ministerial work in her defence role, is flying back to Britain after being briefed on it. Witnesses described the attacker being an Asian man in 40s with an eight-inch long knife. Prime Minister Theresa May was seen being bundled into a silver Jaguar in the grounds of the palace just 40 yards from where the gunshots unfolded. FORMER WORCESTER MP IN STATE OF \"REAL SHOCK\" MIKE Foster had a lucky escape today after arriving at the scene just 15 minutes after the attacker was shot dead. Worcester's former Labour MP, who lost his seat in 2010, was at Westminster for meetings about his work fronting up an energy and utilities trade body. He left the palaces just after 1pm and tried to get back in just after 3pm, unaware of what had been unfolding moments earlier. The 54-year-old said: \"I'd been in parliament all morning alongside an industry colleague from Worcester Bosch. \"After catching up with some former colleagues I left the building just after 1pm. \"All was normal - the security level was 'severe', which is not unusual and there is always a strong presence of police, some clearly armed. \"It's always a busy place, there's always lots of activity inside the building and lots of tourists outside. \"This was no different, so it came as a real shock just after 3pm when I tried to head back to Westminster for further meetings only to see a major police incident was taking place. \"I followed the advice and vacated the area. \"Something like this was always a possibility, but it's still shocking when it happens. \"Obviously my thoughts like everyone else's are with the families of the deceased and those injured in this cowardly attack.\" Mr Foster, who was Worcester's MP from 1997 to 2010, is now chief executive of the Energy and Utilities Alliance and has not ruled out a return to politics.

In a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, May said Masood was once investigated by intelligence officers over concerns of \"violent extremism\". London attacker named by police as Khalid Masood \"He was a peripheral figure,\" she said. \"The case is historic, he was not part of the current intelligence picture.\" The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group claimed responsibility on Thursday for the attack. It said on its Amaq website the attacker \"carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of the coalition\" of countries fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq. It was not possible for Al Jazeera to independently confirm the claim, which did not offer any details of the attack or name Masood, casting doubt on whether there is any direct link between ISIL and the London killings. Joseph Downing, from the London School of Economics, expressed scepticism over ISIL's claim. \"To me this is something quite common over the last couple of years, over the terrorist attacks in Europe, that ISIL jumps on the bandwagon in the most horrific way and says 'yeah, this our soldier', when there's actually no link between the person carrying out the attack and any particular group,\" he told Al Jazeera. Some 40 people were wounded in the attack, 29 of whom were being treated in hospital, according to police. Seven were still in critical condition. May said those wounded in the attack included 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, two Greeks, and one each from Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and the United States. Three police officers were also wounded. The victims included Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old police officer who was stabbed to death, and two members of the public - a woman in her mid-40s and a man in his mid-50s. Earlier on Thursday, police said eight people had been arrested after raids on six homes in London, Birmingham and other parts of the country in their investigation into the attack, in which a man ploughed into pedestrians in a car and then went on a stabbing spree before being shot dead. Mark Rowley, acting deputy commissioner at the Metropolitan police, also revised down the number of victims to three from four. UK police seek answers after Westminster attack \"It is still our belief that the attacker acted alone [and] was inspired by international terrorism,\" Rowley said. Al Jazeera's Barnaby Phillips, reporting from London, said: \"The absolute priority of the police at this point in time would be to know what sort of accomplices, if any, the assailant had. What sort of assistance, if any, did the assailant have and whether he belonged to any sort of network.\" Rowley said he had no specific information about any further risk to the public, but repeated that more officers were on the streets - armed and unarmed - and that many had leave cancelled or were working extended hours. Some of the wounds suffered by the victims were described as \"catastrophic\". One woman was pulled out alive from the River Thames with serious injuries by port authorities. \"We saw a black vehicle at full speed and it ran down a number of people. I could see people flying all around,\" tourist Babi Nagy told Al Jazeera. \"Immediately it came to mind this was a terrorist attack.\" Polish politician and journalist Radoslaw Sikorski posted a video on Twitter of the aftermath on the bridge, showing several wounded people lying on the ground. \"As I was walking up the steps, there was a man who had fallen and medics were taking care of him. There was a lady who was also stabbed or shot. There was a lot of blood,\" Martin Pearce told Al Jazeera at the scene. The last major attack to hit London was in July 2005, when a coordinated series of bomb blasts targeted its public transportation system during rush hour. The bombings killed 52 people and wounded more than 700 others.","title":"London police: Eight arrests over Westminster attack |  News | Al

{"originalUrl":"http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-world-prays-for-london-in-wake-of-westminster-attack","text":"LONDON — Church and government leaders offered prayers in the aftermath of an attack in London on Wednesday afternoon. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the incident in Westminster this afternoon,” read a post on Twitter from the news page of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales. “We pray tonight for the victims, their families, for all affected by this terrible attack and those who responded so bravely,” said Cardinal Vincent Nichols of Westminster. Details surrounding the March 22 attack in Westminster remained unclear some four hours after an attacker in a car apparently plowed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The assailant then reportedly crashed the car and attempted to enter the Parliament building with a knife before being shot by armed police. According to the U.K.’s TheGuardian, at least five people were killed, including one police officer and one man believed to be the assailant. At least 40 others were reported injured, some severely. Nearby government buildings were placed on lockdown while authorities worked to ensure the safety of the area. Scotland Yard said the attack is being treated “as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise.” British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned it as a “sick and depraved terrorist attack,” according to The Associated Press. March 22 marks the one-year anniversary of the Brussels airport bombings that left more than 30 dead and 300 injured. Those bombings were declared the deadliest act of terrorism in Belgium's history. While details surrounding the London attack remain uncertain, religious and national leaders offered condolences and prayers. “Please join me in praying for the people of #London, especially those killed and injured today. St. George and St. Paul, pray for us,” said Bishop James Conley of Lincoln on Twitter. “Terrible scene in London,” said U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan in a post on Twitter. “Praying for the victims of this apparent act of terror. We stand with our friends in Parliament and Great Britain.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also released a statement offering prayers. “On behalf of the United States, I express my condolences to the victims and their families,” he said. “The American people send their thoughts and prayers to the people of the United Kingdom. We condemn these horrific acts of violence, and whether they were carried out by troubled individuals or by terrorists, the victims know no difference.” We encourage a lively and honest discussion of our content.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/south-bank-evacuated-terror-attack-outside-westminster/","text":"Four dead and 27 injured in Westminster terror attack A man ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman outside Parliament Four people have died following a terror attack outside the Houses of Parliament. A man was shot outside the Houses of Parliament after a car mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and a police officer was stabbed in the terrorist attack this afternoon. Four people died in the attack, including PC Keith Palmer, a woman in her 40s, a man in his 50s, and the attacker – and 29 people were injured. (Note: police originally reported five dead and 40 injured but this was updated on March 23) Southwark News sales assistant Sarah Stewart, who lives in Bermondsey, was at the Lambeth Music Festival at the Southbank Centre when the building was evacuated. She reported three helicopters circling over London Eye, Waterloo Station, and the South Bank Centre, at about 4pm. Lambeth Music Festival was been abandoned and the building evacuated. It is believed 500 people including schoolchildren were attending the event. “I’m outside the South Bank Centre and they’re telling everyone to go to Waterloo Station,” said Sarah, aged 23. “They have put the whole of the South Bank area on lockdown. Nothing is going to reopen until tomorrow. “No one is being allowed back in. They are no letting us near the river. “There about 200 or 300 people around me. I don’t think everyone has heard what happened in Westminster yet. “All the kids who were at the Lambeth Music Festival have gone with their teachers. “About 20 security guards were called down. “It looks like the police are trying to close down Westminster Bridge, Waterloo Bridge and [Hungerford Bridge].” The scene at Westminster after a policeman was stabbed. Credit: Patrick Daly @thepatrickdaly Witnesses told of hearing screams and gunshots ring out near Westminster at about 2.40pm today, Wednesday. It is believed a 4×4 vehicle ploughed down numerous people on Westminster Bridge before crashing into railings outside of Parliament. Some pedestrians either jumped or were knocked over the side of the bridge as the car mounted the pavement and struck a number of pedestrians. A man stabbed an unarmed policeman before being shot three times by an armed policeman. Sitting in the Commons was suspended and MPs and journalists were told to stay inside as the surrounding area continues to be in lockdown. Cmdr Harrington of the Met Police said: “The events near Parliament Square Wesminster has been declared a terrorist incident. “There are a number of casualties including police officers.” A police cordon is in place and people are being asked to avoid the following areas: Parliament Square; Whitehall; Westminster Bridge; Lambeth Bridge; Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/westminster-attack?utm_term=.pi1KPBqoYR#.pi1KPBqoYR","text":"Everyone Arrested In Connection With The Westminster Attack Has Now Been Released Khalid Masood, born Adrian Russell Ajao, was named as the attacker. He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. Three civilians, Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, and a police officer, Keith Palmer, have been identified as his victims. What We Know So Far: Khalid Masood, 52, originally from Kent, was named as the Westminster attacker by the Metropolitan police. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. He had no prior terrorism offence convictions, although he had been previously investigated by security services as a \"peripheral figure\". Police released a picture of him on Friday. At least five people died — including a police officer and Masood — and 31 others required hospital treatment. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility through its news agency, calling the assailant – who it did not name – its \"soldier\". Map Shows Locations Of Incidents In Westminster Attack Chris Applegate / Tom Phillips / BuzzFeed News / Google Maps Updates Posted at Apr. 01, 2017, at 12:12 PM All people arrested in connection with the Westminster terror attack have now been released All those arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in Westminster have now been released and police will take no further action. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and detained under the Terrorism Act was released on Sunday, Met police said in a statement. Eleven other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have also been released with no further action. The inquest into the death of Khalid Masood was adjourned on Thursday and a pre-inquest review has been set by the coroner for May 19. Posted at Mar. 30, 2017, at 17:46 PM London attacker killed by single gunshot to chest, coroner says Matt Dunham / AP The man who mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally attacking a police officer outside parliament was killed by a single gunshot to the chest, coroner's officials said. In all, Khalid Masood killed four people and injured more than 30 others in the March 22 attack before he was shot dead. One other person remains hospitalized in critical condition. Masood's cause of death was revealed Thursday in Westminster coroner's court, the Associated Press reported. —Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 28, 2017, at 07:17 AM Wife of Khalid Masood expresses her sorrow for those killed Dan Kitwood / Getty Images Rohey Hydara, wife of the man who attacked parliament last week, gave a statement through police in which she expressed her \"sadness\" for those who had lost their lives. \"I express my condolences to the families of the victims that have died and wish a speedy recovery to all the injured,\" the BBC reported her as saying. Hydara, believed to be Masood's second wife, also asked for privacy for \"our family, especially the children, at this difficult time\". It comes following the mother of Masood, who was born Adrian Elms, stating she was \"shocked\" and \"deeply saddened\" by the actions of her son. Masood, 52, drove a car across Parliament Bridge, injuring scores of people, before crashing the vehicle into railings at the side of the houses of parliament. He then assaulted police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries, before being shot dead by officers on the scene. Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 17:05 PM Mother of London attacker says she is \"deeply shocked\" by his actions Matt Dunham / AP The mother of the man who carried out the deadly attack in London says she is \"deeply shocked, saddened, and numbed\" by his actions. In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. —Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 16:13 PM No evidence Masood had any direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, Met police say More information has emerged about the actions of the man who killed four people – including a police officer – outside the houses of parliament before being shot dead. Speaking on Monday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for UK counterterrorism policing, said there was \"no evidence\" the man who took the name Khalid Masood in 2005, having been born Adrian Elms, had discussed his intentions prior to the assault. \"His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low-tech, low-cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of IS leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others.\" Basu continued that while there were no direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, \"there is clearly an interest in jihad\". He also said there was \"no evidence\" Masood had been radicalised in prison, adding that \"this is pure speculation at this time\". —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 17:24 PM Police make new arrest Richard Vernalls / PA Wire/PA Images Police in Birmingham on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested in Birmingham in connection with Wednesday's attack in Westminster, it was announced on Sunday night. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Meanwhile, UK home secretary Amber Rudd has said it is \"completely unacceptable\" that messages Khalid Masood may have sent on WhatsApp before launching his deadly attack remain encrypted. \"There should be no place for terrorists to hide,\" Rudd said on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. \"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:26 AM Police: Khalid Masood acted alone Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images The Metropolitan police have said they believe Westminster attacker Khalid Masood acted alone, and warned that we may never know why he acted as he did. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. \"We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned,\" said deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing. \"Even if he acted alone in the preparation we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts to bring reassurance to Londoners, and to provide answers and closure for the families of those killed and the victims and survivors of this atrocity.\" But Basu added: \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this. That understanding may have died with him. \"Nevertheless, we are determined to understand if Masood was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice.\" Appealing for members of the public to help the investigation into the killings, Basu said: \"If you knew Khalid Masood and had spoken to him in the months, weeks or days leading up to this attack please come forward.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:18 AM Family of murdered PC \"overwhelmed\" by support Metropolitan police The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer have said they are \"overwhelmed by the love and support\" they have received since the 48-year-old was killed. \"Most especially,\" a statement released through the Metropolitan police added, \"the outpouring of love and respect for our Keith.\" The statement said: \"We want to thank everyone who has reached out to us over the past few days for their kindness and generosity. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. \"We would also like to express our gratitude to the people who were with Keith in his last moments and who were working that day. There was nothing more you could have done. \"You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. We miss him so much, but we are also incredibly proud of Keith.\" Jack Taylor / Getty Images Tory MP Tobias Ellwood shakes hands with police outside parliament as he arrives for work the day after the attack. Meanwhile Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to Palmer after the officer had been stabbed by Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, has said he is \"heartbroken\" he could not save him. \"I am heartbroken that I could not do more for PC Keith Palmer who gave his life in holding the line against terrorism and defending democracy. I shall be writing to the family of PC Palmer to offer my sincere condolences,\" he said in a statement. \"I'm deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support, especially from the policing fraternity, which I now realise is as close knit as the military's in supporting its own. \"I played only a small part that day, doing what I was taught to do, and am honoured to have been invited to join the Privy Council afterwards. \"It is right that we concentrate our thoughts on the victims as we stand side by side to protect all that we hold dear, including our precious values and way of life which will always prevail.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 22:56 PM Police say deadly Westminster attack lasted 82 seconds Kirsty Wigglesworth / AP The deadly Westminster attack that left four people dead Wednesday began and was over within 82 seconds, police said Saturday. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this,\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said in a statement. \"That understanding may have died with him.\" Authorities believe he acted alone. \"Whilst the attack lasted only 82 seconds it will remain in the memories of many forever,\" Basu said. —Salvador Hernandez Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 17:40 PM Only one person remains in custody over Wednesday's attack On Saturday evening police revealed that one of the two people still in custody in connection with the attack in Westminster had been released. The 27-year-old man arrested late on Thursday in Birmingham was told he would face no further action. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London and bailed until the end of this month has also been released with no further action. Seven other people have also been released and one woman remains out on bail, meaning only one person remains in custody over Khalid Masood's attack –&nbsp;a 58-year-old man who was arrested on Thursday morning at an address in Birmingham, who is being detained under anti-terror laws. Two men still in custody in connection with attack Victoria Jones / PA Wire/PA Images Seven of the 11 people arrested by police investigating Khalid Masood's attack this week have now been released with no further action, it was announced last night. As well as the six people released from custody last night, a 35-year-old man has been released with no further police action, and a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until the end of the month.

They are being detained under the Terrorism Act 2000. One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. She is due to return to police until a date later this month. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 20:17 PM Six people arrested in London attack investigation are released Christopher Furlong / Getty Images Authorities on Friday released six people who were arrested as part of the ongoing investigation into the attack in London. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Khalid Masood – born Adrian Elms – has been named as the man who killed four people and injured 50 others in an attack on Westminster on Wednesday. Here's everything we know about him. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 17:18 PM Muslim leaders in Birmingham are holding emergency meetings across the city There are concerns of a ramped up anti-Muslim backlash that communities may face following the London terror attack. Mahmooda Qureshi from Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism campaign group, told BuzzFeed News a rally was being organised in Birmingham city centre on Saturday, and said: \"It's to distance ourselves and that it has got nothing to do with Islam and to state: not in our name.\" Imams from major Birmingham mosques read sermons addressing the attacks, and called for \"unity\". At a packed Friday prayers with Muslims from all backgrounds, Sheikh Abdur Raheem McCarthy said in a sermon delivered in English that Muslims were \"blessed\" in the UK as they have freedom of faith. \"We also need to increase our relationship with the local community. And instead of making this divide us, let it bring us closer together and let us stand in solidarity against that which is wrong.\" After prayers, the imam read out a statement from the Metropolitan police reassuring the communities there would be extra patrols on the streets, and that the attack was by \"a terrorist and someone not of the faith\". Muhammad Afzal, the chairman of Birmingham Central Mosque, called for calm and said in a statement: \"We request all communities for the unity and calm.\" He added: \"We call upon those that may have even a shred of sympathy for the like-minded terrorists to shake their conscience and realise that such acts are the work of evil and not the work of God-fearing people.\" In the aftermath of Wednesday's attack in London, this photo of a woman walking along Westminster bridge went viral. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. —Rachael Krishna Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 14:29 PM Met police release image of Masood in appeal for information Met Police In an updated statement, the Met police clarified that Masood had previously gone by both Adrian Elms and Adrian Russell Ajao. \"He may also be known by a number of other names,\" they added. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 13:54 PM Downing Street says Google and Facebook \"can and must do more\" to fight extremism Alamy Downing Street added to pressure on Google and Facebook on Friday, warning the internet giants that they \"can and must do more\" to stop hateful and violent material appearing on their platforms. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. As a general point, however, he told reporters that the \"fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one\" and that the technology companies weren't, in the government's view, pulling their weight. \"Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure that this material is not disseminated,\" the Number 10 official said. \"And we have been clear repeatedly that we think they can and must do more. And we are always talking with them on how to achieve that.\" \"The message that we've delivered consistently is that we want them to do more and the ball is now in their court,\" he added. \"Let's see how they respond.\" First images of Masood as a schoolchild emerge Huntleys School Website This photograph, taken when Masood was at school, is believed to have been taken after a four-hour five-a-side tournament for charity. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. \"He had a big personality and everyone liked him,\" Till said. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. The fourth victim, 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes, was named by the Met police today. Rhodes was a retired window cleaner, who was described by neighbours as a \"lovely man,\" according to the Press Association. The neighbour told the news organisation Rhodes had no children and was not married, and that he \"would do anything for anybody\". American Kurt Cochran was identified yesterday. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. \" She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us,\" a spokesperson for the college told BuzzFeed News. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. In a statement on Thursday, his family said he would be remembered as a \"wonderful dad and husband,\" a loving son, brother, and uncle, and a long-time supporter of Charlton FC. He was a friend to \"everyone who knew him\" and was brave, dedicated, courageous, and proud to be a police officer, they said. Met police release more information about Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's birth name has been stated as Adrian Russell Ajao, acting deputy police commissioner Mark Rowley has said in a briefing outside New Scotland Yard this morning. \"We stated he had a number of aliases, and we do know that his birth name was Adrian Russell,\" Rowley said. Rowley said there was \"no evidence of further threats\", but that a \"large, fast paced investigation\" was examining Masood's actions leading up the attack: \"Our determination is to find out if he acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others encouraged or supported him.\" Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. \"We have seized 2,700 items from these searches,\" he said, including \"massive of amounts of computer data for us to search through\". Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. \"Those affected include a real cross-section of ages, from at least 12 nationalities,\" he continued. He said of those in hospital, two remained in \"critical condition\", with one person considered to have \"life-threatening\" injuries. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Details around the attacker, named by the Metropolitan police as 52-year-old Khalid Masood, continue to emerge on Friday morning. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Sadiq Khan, who spoke at the vigil, told BuzzFeed News it was a way of showing \"evil and twisted individuals\" that they were not going to be successful in their aims. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. Houses searched in Brighton and Wales Joe Giddens / PA Wire/PA Images Officers search an address in Birmingham connected to Wednesday's attack. The Metropolitan police have confirmed to BuzzFeed News that as part of today's investigations, houses were also searched in Brighton and Wales. Previously police had only said searches were carried out in London, Birmingham, and \"elsewhere\". The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Overnight a 39-year-old woman was arrested at an address in east London; a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man were arrested at an address in Birmingham; a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 26, 27, and 28 were arrested at a separate address in Birmingham – all on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. \"It's important to stress that we are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident and no police officers are under investigation,\" said IPCC deputy chair Sarah Green. \"The IPCC and the Metropolitan Police Service are following agreed working arrangements related to terrorist incidents, which are working well. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. We are giving this investigation the highest priority and we will conclude it as soon as possible.\" PM visits victims injured in the Westminster attack The PM quietly visited victims who were injured in the attack along Westminster Bridge on Thursday afternoon. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. – Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 16:16 PM Keith Palmer's family: \"A wonderful dad and husband\" Dominic Lipinski / PA Wire/PA Images In a statement, Palmer's family said the former soldier and policeman of 15 years was \"dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous\". Palmer, 48, who was married and had a 5-year-old daughter, was described as \"a wonderful dad and husband\". \"A loving son, brother and uncle. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. We love him so much,\" his family said. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. Colleague PC James Aitkenhead described him as \"a genuinely nice person; nobody had a bad word to say about him. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. \"He had a great work ethic, he worked on our warrants' car for years, getting up at 4am to serve warrants and arresting wanted offenders. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early.\" The 52-year-old was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said \"was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack\". He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was investigated \"some years ago\" as part of a historic investigation into violent extremism but was a peripheral figure. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been called on to retract his statement that the Westminster terror attack on Wednesday was linked to uncontrolled immigration – after it emerged that the security services believe the attacker was born in Britain. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. \"The moment has come for us to point the finger of blame. What these politicians have done in the last 15 years will affect how we live for 100 years,\" he said. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Kurt Cochran, from Utah, was killed in terror attack in Westminster, and his wife Melissa was seriously injured and is in hospital in London. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. \"We are grateful that she will recover,\" he said in the post. \"Our hearts ache for her and their children in losing their loving companion and father. Please continue to pray for our family. Thank you.\" Another relative, Shantell Payne, wrote in a separate Facebook post on Thursday: \"This pain is so heart wrenching and raw it has rocked our family and all that knew him to its core. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. RIP.\" After seeing a picture of his local liaison officer Søren D. Sozza in news coverage of the attack, Mark Oakley, who owns The Eagle pub in Vauxhall, situated near the attack, was moved to share his gratitude on Facebook. \"This image has reinforced my love and respect for the many officers who I have worked with for many years and seeing how close this terror is to where I live and work, and knowing that one of his colleagues was murdered on our streets has deeply saddened me tonight,\" he wrote. Sozza told BuzzFeed News he was \"humbled by Mark's very kind words of appreciation and am encouraged by his defiance to being affected by the incident\". World leaders express condolences for London and the British people Vladimir Putin, Russia's leader, released the following statement: \"Terrorist attacks are becoming increasingly cunning and cynical. It is obvious that all members of the international community should join forces to stand up against the terrorist threat.\" Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. Yesterday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said US president Donald Trump had spoken to Theresa May, and that the US was continuing to monitor the situation. German chancellor Angela Merkel, before more details about the nature of the attack had been established, said: \"Even if the background to these attacks has yet to be cleared up, I would like to emphasise on behalf of Germany and its citizens: We stand resolutely on Britain's side in the fight against any form of terrorism.\" François Hollande, France's leader, declared France's \"solidarity and support\" for Britain and the victims of the attack. \"Terrorism affects us all,\" he said. \"France, which has been so badly hit in recent times, knows what the British people are suffering today.\" The Netherlands' leader, Mark Rutte, said: \"Horrible images from London. The very heart of the city has been struck. Our thoughts are with the British people.\" And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. \"Belgium stands with UK in fight against terror,\" he said. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 13:20 PM Security services could have dropped monitoring attacker because of resources or the closure of an investigation Stressing they did not know the identity of the attacker, a former British intelligence officer told BuzzFeed News that \"peripheral figure\" would indicate an individual that MI5 would have looked into, and possibly monitored, for reasons of behaviour, background, or connections. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. An indiscriminate attack by a British-born terrorist was a strike against \"free people everywhere\" and injured people from various countries, Theresa May told the House of Commons on Thursday. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. The man had been investigated \"some years ago\" because of concerns about violent extremism but was considered a \"peripheral\" figure, May said. \"The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture,\" May said. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. \"We are not afraid. And our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,\" she said. Scotland's first minister has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful\" city of London Wpa Pool / Getty Images Nicola Sturgeon has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful city\" of London during a sombre edition of First Minister's Questions at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. \"Many of us in this chamber have friends and colleagues, indeed some of us have family members, who work within the Palace of Westminster,\" said Sturgeon. \"Parliamentarians, staff, and journalists. \"Yesterday was a harrowing day for all of them and they have our support and good wishes. Above all, we stand in solidarity with London – a vibrant, diverse, wonderful city that will never be cowed by mindless acts of violence.\" Sturgeon went on to confirm that there was \"no intelligence of any increased threat\" to Scotland in the wake of yesterday's attack in London, but added that security had been stepped up in \"key locations\" throughout the country. \"Acts of terrorism are not the responsibility of any one faith or section of our society,\" the first minister continued. \"The only people to blame for acts of terrorism are the individuals who plan and perpetrate them.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson expressed her \"deep shock\" at the events in London, but went on to warn would-be attackers: \"We will not be silenced, and we will not be cowed.\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale described Westminster as a \"beacon of democracy\", and went on to say that \"this cannot and must not turn into a war on any one community\". The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Following the attack, an image of a London Underground sign began to circulate on Twitter. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. \"My judgment is he or she speaks for the whole country irrespective of faith of creed when they wrote: 'All terrorists are politely reminded that this is London and whatever you do to us we will drink tea and jolly well carry on',\" he told the house. May called it a \"wonderful tribute\", and said it \"in a very simple way I think has encapsulated everything everybody in this house has said today\". \"What happened yesterday was an appalling atrocity,\" he said. \"Today, we are united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity. \"I express my condolences to the family and friends of PC Keith Palmer, who gave his life yesterday in defence of the public and our democracy – and to the loved ones of those still in a critical condition including the French schoolchildren visiting our capital from Concarneau in Brittany. ... \"I thank all the dedicated NHS staff working to save lives, including those from St Thomas' Hospital who rushed out to help those in need. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. \"It behoves us all not to rush to judgement, but to wait for the police to establish the facts. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred.\" The Scottish National Party's leader in the House of Commons Angus Robertson echoed May and Corbyn's sentiments, saying: \"Today of all days we are reminded that notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none.\" Robertson also paid tribute to police,and the bravery of the Conservative minister who went to the aid of the stabbed officer: \"'We are all hugely grateful to all the police, security staff and first responders who ran towards danger without concern to their safety, and I include in that our colleague the Right Honourable and gallant member for Bournemouth East Tobias Ellwood.\" Parliament is to review its security procedures in an emergency meeting later today in the wake of yesterday's terror attack. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. \"We will be having an emergency meeting,\" he said. \"We'll be getting information, what else needs to be put in place, and we will reflect, not instantly, we've got to take on board what's happened and we will make decisions accordingly. Of course, we've got to look after both houses.\" TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. People from 10 different countries caught up in attack, PM says Sky News screengrab Speaking in the Commons, Theresa May revealed some details about those injured in the attack. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. \"We are in close contact with the governments of the countries of all those affected,\" the prime minister said. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:49 AM PM Theresa May says attacker was \"British-born\" and had been previously investigated by MI5 as a \"peripheral\" figure Addressing the House of Commons, prime minister Theresa May confirmed that the attacker, who has still not been publicly identified, was known to MI5 and police and had been a \"peripheral figure\" in a \"historic\" investigation into violent extremism. \"It is still believed that this attacker acted alone and there is no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public,\" she said. \"His identity is known to police and MI5 and when operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. \"What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. Intensive investigations continue.\" May also reiterated earlier lines from the police and defence secretary Michael Fallon that the investigation is focusing on the \"working assumption\" the attacker was \"inspired by Islamist ideology\". \"We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real,\" she said. \"But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not – and will not – be cowed by this threat. \"As acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley has made clear, we are stepping up policing to protect communities across the country and to reassure the public.\" May praised the security and emergency forces for their swift and calm response to the attack, made more remarkable after they had \"lost one of their own\". \"We will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security, and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way,\" she said. \"On behalf of the whole country I want to pay tribute to them for the work they have been doing to reassure the public, treat the injured and bring security back to the streets of our capital city. \"That they have lost one of their own in yesterday's attack only makes their calmness and professionalism all the more remarkable.\" —James Ball and Francis Whittaker Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:43 AM Prime minister reveals nationalities of those wounded and more details on attacker in speech to House of Commons Westminster Bridge survivor: \"The car came out of nowhere\" Carl Court / Getty Images BuzzFeed News has spoken to a survivor who was hit by the attacker's car and flung to the ground on Westminster Bridge, and who said he was unable to describe the Wednesday's events because of the horrific aftermath. The survivor, who asked not to be named, was visiting London from Liverpool and sustained cuts and bruises to his legs – he was with friends who were also hit by the car but survived. He has now been discharged from hospital. \"There was just lot of yelling and commotion,\" he said. \"Then this car came out of nowhere and knocked me and my mates over. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. They were pretty horrific.\" —Pat Smith Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:23 AM Met police have made another arrest in connection to the attack In total eight people have now been arrested, following raids on six properties across the country. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 09:47 AM Minute's silence held for those killed in Westminster attack The streets around parliament remained closed on Thursday morning. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. \"Such acts of savagery against the innocent can never be justified,\" Fox said. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of those killed in Wednesday's attack on Westminster, her place of work confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Thursday morning. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. \"We are all deeply shocked and saddened at the news that one of the victims yesterday was a member of our staff, Aysha Frade. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. We will be offering every support we can to them as they try to come to terms with their devastating loss,\" Rachel Borland, principal at DLD College London, told BuzzFeed News. \"Aysha worked as a member of our administration team at the college. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us.\" According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Met police revise death toll to four, including attacker Four people, including the attacker, died in the attack on Westminster yesterday, the Metropolitan police confirmed to BuzzFeed News this morning following Commissioner Mark Rowley's earlier statement. Previous statements from New Scotland Yard had said that five people – including the attacker –&nbsp;had been killed in the assault outside the British parliament. Defence secretary Michael Fallon says security services' working assumption is that the attack was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\" Andy Buchanan / AFP / Getty Images Defence secretary Michael Fallon, speaking to the BBC's Today programme, said the \"working assumption\" was that the attack on Westminster was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\". Fallon said the Metropolitan police were making \"urgent\" investigations into the alleged attacker and his known associates – although he declined to state whether there was any indication he acted alone. \"The working assumption is that this is related to Islamic terrorism in some form, but they [the police] don't yet have a full enough picture of this man and his known associates. That work is still going on,\" he said. \"This kind of attack, this lone-wolf attack, using things from daily life, a vehicle, a knife, are much more difficult to forestall, and we are also dealing with a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage but simply wants to kill as many people as possible. \"This is a new element to international terrorism but our forces are working extremely hard. I have every confidence that they will track down his known associates.\" The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. \"Although there is intense security around the Palace of Westminster, London is going to work this morning,\" Fallon said. \"Parliament itself will resume at the normal time.\" \"London is getting back to work. London has seen this before and is taking it on the chin,\" he said. \"I do want to reassure you that the police and the security services are doing everything possible to make sure that people can go about their daily life as safely as possible.\" The Metropolitan police confirm seven arrests made last night Mark Rowley, the national lead for counterterrorism policing and the acting deputy commissioner, confirmed that seven arrests had been made, following raids on six properties across the country. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Among the dead were a \"mix of nationalities\", Rowley said, declining to name any of those killed other than 48-year-old police officer Keith Palmer. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. Probed on the identity of the alleged attacker, Rowley declined to comment on the individual's nationality and said he would not be naming the suspect – and urged the media to respect that decision. \"It is still our belief that this attacker acted alone, and was inspired by international terrorism,\" Rowley said. Meanwhile, he said London will see an increased police presence, as at least 60 officers continue working on a \"large and complicated crime scene\" outside Westminster. \"We must not allow terrorism to sow discord and fear in our city,\" he said. —Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 07:34 AM Police make ”several\" arrests following raid on property in Birmingham, multiple reports state Carl Court / Getty Images The police have made \"several\" arrests after a raid on a property in Birmingham, the BBC, ITV, and Sky News have reported. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Press inquiries to West Midlands police were redirected to the Metropolitan police, who declined to comment on the reports when contacted by BuzzFeed News, citing \"operational reasons\". Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. \"There is an ongoing police operation, no further details are being given at this stage,\" West Midlands police told The Guardian. Separately, it was reported the car – described by witnesses as a Hyundai 4x4 – used to plough through pedestrians in the cycle line on Westminster Bridge was believed to have been rented from near the raided property in Solihull. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner told the Today programme that there were \"indications\" that the car began its journey in Birmingham. Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 22:48 PM Slain officer is identified as death toll rises to 5 people BBC The death toll in Wednesday's Westminster attack rose to five people, including the attacker and a police officer, who was identified as a 15-year veteran. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Metro Police Getty Keith Palmer. \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that to happen,\" Rowley said. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. \"Terrorists have a clear aim: that is to create discord, destruction, and to create fear,\" he said. \"The police stand with all communities in the UK and will take action against anyone who seeks to undermine society, especially where their crimes are motivated by hate.\" —Claudia Koerner Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 21:27 PM Government officials describe crawling on hands and knees to escape attack Carl Court / Getty Images Grant Shapps was walking through from his office to a vote in the House of Commons, making small talk with a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, when he noticed something was amiss at the gates of parliament. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. \"I could hear a kerfuffle going on, which is not unusual as there's often protests by the gates,\" the former minister told BuzzFeed News. \"As I'm looking around I hear, 'BAM BAM BAM' – what sounded like four shots to me.\" \"Suddenly, a police officer is standing right where we are, shouting, 'Get down, get down, get back!' We crawled, hands and knees, back to a safety position.\" The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Prime minister Theresa May says attack targeted freedom and democracy BBC Theresa May on Wednesday night said the attack at Westminster was no accident, but rather a direct attack on British democracy. \"The location of this attack was no accident,\" the prime minister said in a speech outside Number 10. \"The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions, and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy, and freedom of speech.\" The single attacker first drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, May said, killing two people and injuring others – including three police officers. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. \"And we will all move forward together,\" she said, \"never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us.\" News reports identify wrong man as Westminster attacker A Channel 4 News report misidentified a man associated with a British Muslim terrorist group as the Westminster attacker on its evening broadcast. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The mistaken report was repeated at the top of the Channel 4+1 news, which began to rebroadcast the earlier report. The channel then went dark as \"conflicting information came to light,\" a Channel 4 News statement said. The first doctor to attend to those injured in the Westminster attack was not on duty at the time, but rushed to the scene when he heard screaming. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. \"I heard the screaming so ran to help and the police ran me in,\" he told us. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. —Laura Silver Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:30 PM Politicians and staff locked inside buildings in Westminster Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images Hundreds of politicians and their staff are still locked in Westminster Abbey, while police attempt to collect eyewitness testimony and evidence on this afternoon's attack. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. People still on the premises were then led into the ancient Westminster Hall at around 4.30pm – around 90 minutes after the attack. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Many were then led out through the St Stephen's Entrance into Westminster Abbey, where \"up to 1,000 people\" remain, according to one individual, who said others had been left in Westminster Hall. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. —Jim Waterson Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:08 PM Home secretary praises bravery of emergency services Daniel Sorabji / AFP / Getty Images Forensics officers at work at the scene.

A readout of the call provided by the White House said: \"President Donald J. Trump spoke today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom to offer his condolences on today's terror attack in London and his praise for the effective response of security forces and first responders. \"He pledged the full cooperation and support of the United States Government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. \"We obviously condemn today's attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism, and we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation,\" he said. \"The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers. \"The city of London and Her Majesty's government have the full support of the US government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible.\" Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords will sit tomorrow at their normal times. —Alicia Melville-Smith Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 18:34 PM Witnesses on London Eye describe being kept in the air for hours Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images People are seen inside the pods of the London Eye during the incident Tourists on the London Eye, the landmark ferris wheel not far from parliament on the other side of the Thames, have described how they were kept in their capsules for three hours as the attack unfolded. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. \"The first thing we noticed was the flashing lights of medics attending to the injured people on the bridge, and then the helicopters,\" he told BuzzFeed News. \"There were three separate groups of injured people on the bridge, at each end and in the middle. It took half an hour before anyone was moved.\" He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Jim Hutchinson Kody and Taylor Davis, from Utah, told BuzzFeed News they were at the top of the London Eye when it came to a stop. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. \"We eventually managed to call our families and they told us what had happened.\" Taylor said they first had an idea something was wrong when they saw \"a big commotion and lots of stretchers\". Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. \"The attack started when a car was driven over Westminster Bridge hitting and injuring a number of members of the public, including three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony,\" Rowley said. He added that police \"we're satisfied at this stage that there looks to be only one attacker but it would be foolish to be over-confident so early on.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:48 PM Photograph appears to show knives at scene of parliament attack This photograph taken from inside the Palace of Westminster by PA's Stefan Rousseau shows an armed officer standing on what appears to be a knife.

I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. \"I didn't think anything else was going on until I saw lots of people gathered near the iron fences, and I went over. That's when I heard the gunshots.\" Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. \"It took a while for what had happened to sink in,\" he said. \"It wasn't scary while it happened, but now after the event, I'm shaken.\" Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:25 PM Met police say counterterrorism investigation is underway Jack Taylor / Getty Images Commander B.J. Harrington Scotland Yard's Commander B.J. Harrington said the Metropolitan police are remaining open-minded as to the motive at this stage, but that a full counterterrorism investigation is already underway. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. \"We received a number of different reports, which included a person in a river, a car in collision with pedestrians, and a man armed with a knife,\" he said. \"Officers were already in that location as part of routine policing. Immediately additional officers were sent to the scene, as were firearms officers.\" Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. \"Our response will be ongoing for some time and it is important that we gather all possible information and evidence,\" he said. \"Public safety is our top priority and we are reviewing our policing stance across London, and throughout the course of this afternoon there will be additional police and officers deployed across the capital.\" The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee later today, a spokeswoman in Downing Street said. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks.

She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. He said: \"I was walking across Westminster Bridge and a bus stopped right in front of me and everybody started screaming. And I saw a trainer [shoe] in the road, and I thought somebody must have been hit by a car, and then I saw a body on the other side of the road, and then there was another body further up, and then when I looked over the side of the bridge there was another body in the river. \"I didn't see anything. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. \"They were lying face down in the water.\" The BBC later published camera footage of someone falling into the river as a speeding vehicle plows through: The London Ambulance Service Deputy Director of Operations Pauline Cranmer confirmed 10 people were treated by emergency services. \"We can confirm we have treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge and have put a number of hospitals on alert as we continue to respond to this incident,\" he said in a statement. \"We were called at 2.40pm today, with the first ambulance crew arriving within six minutes. \"We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, London's Air Ambulance and our Hazardous Area Response Team. \"We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to ensure patients receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. \"We have declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. \"As we are very busy dealing with this incident, we would ask the public to only call us in a genuine emergency.\" —James Ball Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:42 PM At least one dead and multiple casualties reported One woman has died, according to an anonymous medical source being quoted by multiple media outlets.

Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:31 PM Photo shows police officer pointing gun at suspect on the ground This afternoon's Scottish parliament debate has been suspended in light of the incident in Westminster, but the Holyrood parliament has been strongly criticised for how long it took to make the decision. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Inside the chamber, outrage grew that the debate was continuing, with Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser requesting that business was suspended but the deputy presiding officer replying that it would be \"business as usual\". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. However, just before 4pm, presiding officer Ken Macintosh decided to suspend the sitting out of respect for \"our sister parliament\" and added there will be time to resume the debate in future. Davidson tweeted: \"Very pleased that sense has won the day & Holyrood has been suspended until we have a better understanding of what is going on in WM.\" Sturgeon added: \"My thoughts are with everyone in and around Westminster caught up in this dreadful incident – and with the brave emergency services.\" —Jamie Ross Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:02 PM Some MPs and peers have been evacuated from parliament Many politicians inside parliament have been evacuated by armed police, while some other areas remain in lockdown.

He said: \"First of all, colleagues will have appreciated that events have been moving rapidly and I want to emphasise that the knowledge that I have .... is so far very limited. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. \"It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police, an air ambulance is currently attending the scene to remove the casualties. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. \"I shall endeavour to do the very best I can, both at the despatch box and by communicating with my opposite numbers in other political parties to ensure that members are kept aware of what is happening, but at the moment, the very clear advice from the police and the director of security in the house is that we should remain under suspension and that the chamber should remain in lockdown until we receive advice that it is safe to go back to normal procedures.\" —Marie Le Conte Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 15:10 PM This is the scene outside parliament shortly after the incident Phil Han / BuzzFeed News Parliament Square is being closed and cleared, with an emergency helicopter parked in the middle of the area.

Khalid Masood killed three people when he drove into crowds on 22 March and stabbed a policeman to death before being shot dead at the UK Parliament. Emergency services staff were among the 2,000-strong multi-faith congregation. Melissa Cochran, whose husband died in the attack, said the service was \"the most beautiful thing I've ever seen\". \"My husband was a big fan of cathedrals and he would have very much liked to have seen that place - it was beautiful,\" she added. Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Melissa Cochran was injured in the attack which killed her husband of 25 years, Kurt Cochran She said: \"The support of my family and the outpouring of love from everyone has given me the strength to to do what I have to do. My husband would want me to continue and wouldn't want me to not move forward as quickly as possible.\" Mrs Cochran was seriously injured during the attack which left her with a broken leg, broken ribs and head injuries.

He was sweet and kind and I'm extremely proud of him. I'm very happy that the world now knows what a wonderful man he was\", she added. 'It crushed me' Speaking to the BBC, Mrs Cochran said she could recall \"the panic of not being able to see my husband anywhere\" and the moment she found out her husband had died. \"It was after the surgery on my leg, I had come out of recovery and they placed me in a hospital room. My parents had come to visit and were there waiting for me when I came out and I had asked them to find out what had happened to my husband. \"Previously to that no-one could tell me... no-one had any information. My parents walked out of the room and came back in. \"Both grabbed my hand and said that he didn't make it, which crushed me.\" Image copyrightGetty Images Addressing the congregation earlier, the Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend John Hall praised the unity of Londoners and Britons in the aftermath of the attack. He said: \"We stand together just as in this service the world faiths are represented and we will pray together above all for the gift of hope. \"Our prayer and commitment is to live together peacefully and respectfully rich in our diversity and to sing together in harmony.\" However, he said the attack had left the nation \"bewildered\". He added: \"What could possibly motivate a man to hire a car and take it from Birmingham to Brighton to London, and then drive it fast at people he had never met, couldn't possibly know, against whom he had no personal grudge, no reason to hate them and then run at the gates of the Palace of Westminster to cause another death? It seems likely that we shall never know.\" 'Best of humanity' Labour MP Mary Creagh said the mood at the service was both sombre and resolute. Image caption The Very Reverend John Hall praised the unity of Londoners and Britons She said: \"We saw the worst of humanity with the terror attack... but we also saw the best of humanity, coming together, and we saw that again today, in renewed resolution, and solidarity with the families.\" The Dean invited members of the congregation to light candles to honour the commitment. Prince William lit the first candle and the light was passed around to people at the service. Home Secretary Amber Rudd gave the first reading at the service from Jeremiah 31: 15-17, reflecting the service's theme of hope. The second reading was made by Prince William, who told the story of the Good Samaritan. Those who died in the attack were Aysha Frade, 44, who worked at a London sixth-form college; American tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, from Utah; retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London; and father-of-two PC Keith Palmer, 48. It is the first time members of all their families have come together in the same place.","title":"London attack: Families attend Westminster service - BBC

In a statement (via Mashable), the company explained how quickly its team responded to a legal request for information: Our team responded in under 30 minutes last week to verify that the legal order was valid and provided law enforcement the information that was sought Microsoft’s President, Brad Smith, continued by explaining that the team responsible for handing over information when requested was available “24/7,” while defending the company’s decision to comply with legal requests: Our global team is on call 24/7 and responds when it receives a proper and lawful order. This of course is different from helping a government outside the rule of law to turn over private information or hack or attack a customer, which we’ve said clearly we will not do. We’re committed both to protecting public safety and safeguarding personal privacy, and we believe that proper legal process is the key to striking this balance. Microsoft’s response comes after the UK’s Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, called for companies to not “provide a secret place for terrorists,” saying that WhatApp’s end-to-end encryption is “completely unacceptable.” How do you feel about Microsoft handing over the data upon request?

Mr Khan chose not to respond to the 39-year-old New Yorker’s comments directly, telling CNN: “I’m not going to respond to a tweet from Donald Trump Jr. I’ve been doing far more important things over the last 24 hours.” London Mayor Sadiq Khan: \"I'm not going to respond to a tweet from Donald Trump Jr, I've been doing more important things over the past 24h\" pic.twitter.com/JGibM7vWOT “Part and parcel of living in a great global city is you’ve got to be prepared for these things.

Kurt Cochran, 54, was touring Europe with his 46-year-old wife, Melissa, when they were mowed down by the terrorist on the south end of Westminster Bridge. Mr Cochran died from his injuries, while his wife is recovering in hospital. “A great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the London terror attack.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/27/man-arrested-over-incident-in-whitehall-near-parliament?utm_campaign=crowdfire&utm_content=crowdfire&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","text":"A suspected terrorist attack was foiled after armed police arrested a man who is alleged to have been found carrying knives near the Houses of Parliament. The Guardian understands the operation was triggered following a tip-off to police by a member of Britain’s Muslim community who was concerned about the man’s behaviour. Officers were lying in wait for the suspect whose movements were being tracked by a joint police and MI5 operation as he travelled into central London on Thursday. They swooped close to Westminster underground station. The scene where the man, aged 27, was arrested is metres away from where Khalid Masood launched his attacks on Westminster Bridge and the parliamentary estate five weeks ago, leaving five people dead, including himself. Masood used a vehicle to mow down pedestrians before using a knife to stab a police officer to death. Thursday’s daylight arrest followed a tense intelligence operation following the tip-off from someone who knew the suspect, with further investigation identifying the man detained as being of concern to counter-terrorism investigators. One source said the stop was “not random, it was targeted”. The man was pinned to the ground after his arrest at 2.22pm, with armed officers standing over him. Shortly afterwards, forensic experts examined the ground where two knives had fallen, along with a bag, which is believed to have contained the knives. It is thought the suspect, who is believed to be from the London area but born outside the United Kingdom was acting alone. Given the location of the arrest, investigators believe one possibility was an attack on the Westminster or Whitehall areas. Past Islamist propaganda has called for attacks on civilians or symbols of power. Security is especially tight around Whitehall following last month’s attack . Police said the arrest came at the junction of Parliament Street and Parliament Square, barely 30 metres from Westminster Bridge. Witnesses said the suspect wrestled to the floor by police but appeared calm after his detention. MI5 and Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command will try to establish if the suspect had any direction from overseas, and whether Islamic State played any role – either directly, through contact, or indirectly through its propaganda urging attacks. The motivation of the suspect will be a key part of the investigation and his mental health will be of keen interest to investigators. At least two knife attacks, in Leytonstone in 2015 and Russell Square in 2016, thought initially to be terrorist acts, were later determined to be best explained by the suspects’ severe mental health problems. Police said in a statement: “A man has been arrested in Whitehall this afternoon, at approximately 14.22, following a stop and search as part of an ongoing operation. The man was arrested in Parliament Street … by armed officers from the Met’s specialist firearms command. “The man, aged in his late 20s, was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Knives have been recovered from him. “He is being detained under the Terrorism Act and is in custody in a south London police station. Detectives from the counter-terrorism command are continuing their investigation, and as a result of this arrest there is no immediate known threat.” The suspect was held on Parliament Street for more than half an hour, without speaking or struggling. While two officers detained him, about two dozen heavily armed police blocked off the traffic and pedestrians on one side of the road with tape. A forensic officer examines items at the scene. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA He was led away into a police car at around 3.15pm, while scene-of-crime officers examined knives and a rucksack on the traffic island in the middle of Parliament Street at the junction with Parliament Square. The prime minister, Theresa May, praised the work by police and MI5, saying: “I think it shows that our police and our intelligence and security services are on the alert as they always are, looking to keep us safe and secure. “I would say that we owe a huge debt of gratitude to these people, many of whom are unseen, unheard, yet the job they do day in, day out to keep us secure is a really important one and we should thank them for it.” Features of the arrest were highly unusual. Police prefer to arrest terrorism suspects in dawn raids at their homes, away from any potential target of attack. One source said there may have been a need to gather evidence to secure a conviction. Arresting someone in their home with knives poses challenges of convincing a jury that a terrorist attack was planned. Harry Peasnell, 27, and Andy Burnage, 22, were leaving a building adjacent to the scene which houses various government offices after a meeting with officials when they were told the usual entrance on to Whitehall was closed. As they left the area via an alternative route, they said they saw a man in his 20s or 30s, who they thought was the suspect, being spoken to by police next to the wall of the offices. Peasnell said police were “quick on the scene” and that he was not worried like he was during the terror attack in the area just weeks ago. “Last time, all the buildings were on lockdown and no one was allowed to leave,” he said. Witness Ian Moss, who was travelling on a bus through Whitehall at the time, said the suspect was on the ground in the middle traffic island. He said police “looked like they were tending” to him, adding: “He was arrested. He could walk so no idea if he was injured.” Asked if he was struggling while on the ground, Moss said: “No, not at all. He had police pointing arms at him though.” A French tourist who declined to be named, said: “We just saw the man arrested and that’s all. He was very calm. I think they got him on the ground, then they stood him up against the wall. There were lots of policemen.” The incident unfolded with few MPs present in the Palace of Westminster because parliament is winding down before the election and May has already headed out on to the campaign trail. However, civil servants were still working as normal and a number of HMRC staff were locked outside their building when the Whitehall entrance was closed off. The atmosphere in parliament remained calm and all gates were operating as normal during the incident. The nervousness around security at Westminster was heightened when, in a separate incident, packages addressed to parliamentarians containing white powder were intercepted before they could reach their victims. The terrorism threat level for the United Kingdom remains at severe, meaning an attack by terrorists is assessed to be highly likely. The biggest threat is seen as coming from Islamic State, which constantly urges followers to stage attacks.","title":"Police thwart suspected terror attack in Westminster | UK news | The

{"originalUrl":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Westminster_attack?wprov=sfla1","text":"Police treated the attack as \"Islamist-related terrorism\". Masood reportedly said in a final text message that he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries in the Middle East. Amaq News Agency, which is linked to Islamic State, said the attacker answered the group's calls to target citizens of states that are fighting against it, though the claim was questioned by the UK police and government. Police have found no link with a terrorist organisation and believe Masood acted alone.[1] One of the victims, a Romanian tourist, was thrown by the car's impact over the parapet of the bridge into the River Thames below. Having been knocked unconscious and sustained severe injuries from the fall, she was later rescued by the crew of a river cruise and brought aboard a London Fire Brigade boat.[8] She later died in hospital from her injuries.[14] The car continued, and crashed into railings on Bridge Street at the north perimeter of the Palace of Westminster.[15] Despite attempts to resuscitate him, Masood died at the scene from a single gunshot wound to his chest;[19][20][21] he was pronounced dead at 15:35 at hospital.[22] Passers-by, including MP Tobias Ellwood (the Foreign Minister for the Middle East and Africa) and paramedics, attempted to revive PC Palmer, also without success.[23][21] Police later confirmed that PC Palmer had been wearing a protective vest, which did not appear to have been punctured in the attack.[24] Six people, including the attacker, died as a result of the incident, and around 50 others were injured, some of them severely. Of the five people killed by the attacker, three were British nationals.[13][17] Aysha Frade, a British teacher, believed to have been walking along the bridge to pick up her children from school, was struck by the attacker's car and killed.[40] A tourist from the United States, Kurt Cochran, was also hit by the car and died.[17] Cochran was visiting London from Utah to celebrate his 25th anniversary with his wife Melissa, who was among the injured.[41] The police officer killed was PC Keith Palmer, 48, an unarmed police officer who was on duty with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection command.[42][43] Palmer had 15 years of experience in the Metropolitan Police Service.[20] The fourth victim was Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Clapham in south-west London, who was hit by the car and later died in hospital after his life support was switched off.[44][45] A fifth victim, Andreea Cristea, a 31-year-old tourist from Romania, fell into the Thames during the attack; she died in hospital as a result of her injuries on 6 April after her life support was withdrawn. Her Romanian boyfriend, who had planned to propose marriage during their trip to London, was also injured during the attack.[46][33] The attacker was identified by the Metropolitan Police as 52-year-old Briton Khalid Masood.[48] He was born Adrian Russell Elms, but later changed the name to Adrian Russell Ajao when he took the name of his stepfather.[49][50][51] He changed his name to Khalid Masood after he converted to Islam. Police said he also used several other aliases, including Khalid Choudry.[49][52] Born in Kent, Masood was brought up in Rye, East Sussex, and later attended secondary school in Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Most recently he was living in the West Midlands.[53] When he was 16, he dropped out of school and by 18 he was described as a heavy cocaine user.[54] In 2000, he was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm after a knife attack in a public house in Northiam in Sussex. In 2003, he was sentenced to a further six months in prison for possession of an offensive weapon following another knife attack in Eastbourne in Sussex.[55][56] As well as these two prison terms, Masood had convictions for public order offences going back to 1983.[55][56] A British newspaper obtained a CV of Masood's in which he described himself as having taught English in Saudi Arabia from November 2005 to November 2006, and again from April 2008 to April 2009.[60][61] After this, according to the CV he returned to the United Kingdom and worked at a TEFL college in Luton.[62] In early March 2015, he made a brief trip to Saudi Arabia on an Umrah visa, normally issued to those making a pilgrimage to Mecca.[50][61] During his time in Saudi Arabia he was not recorded as having a criminal record there.[61] In 2010, Masood was a \"peripheral figure\" in an MI5 investigation of a group of Islamists later convicted of plotting to bomb a Territorial Army base in Luton. Following a risk assessment, MI5 decided he did not pose a threat.[63][64] The Metropolitan Police said he was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.[65] He had not been convicted of any terrorism offences.[66] Farasat Latif, director of the language school in Luton where Masood taught between 2010 and 2012, told The Guardian that when Masood lived in Luton he was apolitical and not aligned with the younger and predominantly Asian local radical Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun. Although aware of violence in Masood's past, Latif had only seen him become angry once, when Masood learnt of plans for a march by the English Defence League through Luton.[67] Between 2012 and 2016, Masood appeared in MI5 investigations as a contact of individuals linked to Al-Muhajiroun.[57] Three days before the attack, Masood carried out reconnaissance of Westminster Bridge in person and online.[57] Masood spent the night before the attack at the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton in Sussex and was described as \"laughing and joking\" by the manager there.[68] Pre-inquest revealed that he had used anabolic steroids shortly before the terrorist attack.[69] Masood's profile was atypical in that most jihadi terrorists are under 30, while he was 52. On 22 March, the day of the attack, the Metropolitan Police said it believed the attack was inspired by \"international terrorism\"[70][71] and that they were working under the assumption that it was \"Islamist-related terrorism\".[72][73][74] On 23 March, the Islamic State-associated Amaq News Agency announced that the attacker was \"a soldier of the Islamic State, executing the operation in response to calls to target citizens of coalition nations\".[75] The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, cast doubts on this claim.[76] Analysts monitoring Islamic State online said the claim appeared to be an effort to mask its losses in Iraq and Syria, adding that the lack of biographical information on the attacker and lack of specifics about the attack suggested it was not directly involved.[77] Describing Masood as a \"terrorist\",[78] the Metropolitan Police said it was investigating whether he was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or was being directed by others.[79] On 25 March Neil Basu, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and Senior National Coordinator for UK Counter-Terrorism Policing, announced that investigators believed Masood acted alone.[80] On 27 March, Basu announced that Masood clearly had an interest in jihad, that his methods echoed the rhetoric of Islamic State leaders and that investigators have found no evidence he was linked with it or al-Qaeda.[81][63] The security services later recovered the last WhatsApp message sent by Masood shortly before his attack. In it, Masood reportedly said he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries of the Middle East.[1] He had written a document named \"Jihad in the Quran and Sunnah\", with his photograph on the front page and multiple extracts from the Quran that could be seen as supportive of jihad and martyrdom.[57] He sent this document to numerous contacts a few minutes before the attack.[57] Some early reports gave descriptions of two supposed attackers, one described as a \"bald white man\" and another as a \"black man with goatee beard\".[17] On the morning after the attack, however, Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan Police's Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations, stated that the police believed the attacker acted alone.[70]Abu Izzadeen was also erroneously identified as the attacker on social media, Channel 4 News and The Independent shortly after the attack, although Izzadeen was actually in prison at the time.[82] In April 2017, OFCOM announced an investigation into the Channel 4 News naming of Izzadeen.[83] Police and media outside the Hagley Road premises that were raided on 22 March, seen on the morning following the raid At 23:00 on 22 March, West Midlands Police raided a flat in Hagley Road, Birmingham. By the morning of 23 March, six locations in East London and Birmingham had been raided resulting in the arrests of eight people on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts.[17][48][84] Officials also carried out searches in London, Brighton and Carmarthenshire.[85][48] The investigation was named Operation Classific. By 24 March, three further arrests had taken place, two men overnight in the West Midlands and North West England and a woman during the day in Manchester.[86] A woman, arrested earlier in East London, was released on bail.[87] Later on 24 March, seven of those initially arrested were released without further action and the woman arrested in Manchester was released on bail.[88][20][50] By 25 March, only one man from Birmingham remained in custody and the woman on bail from East London had been removed from police enquiries. Up to that point in the investigation, 2,700 items had been seized and 3,500 witnesses had been contacted.[6] A further arrest was made in Birmingham on 26 March.[89] By 1 April, all 12 suspects arrested after the attack had been released without charge.[90] Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords resumed their normal functions on 23 March, the day after the attack.[20] A one-minute silence in honour of the dead was observed in Parliament, and by London's emergency services, at 09:33. The time was selected to coincide with the start of the day's official parliamentary business.[93][74] In the morning session of parliament, Prime Minister Theresa May said that, \"Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy, but today we meet as normal ... to deliver a simple message: We are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism.\"[93][74] In a later statement following the June 2017 London attack, May stated that all three recent attacks were \"bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamic extremism\".[94] The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Opposition, described the attack as \"an appalling atrocity\".[93][74] The speakers of both Houses of Parliament jointly offered sympathy to those affected, and thanked the emergency services.[95] The Scottish Parliament suspended the day's proceedings, including a debate on a second independence referendum.[96] Some MSPs who opposed the decision to suspend parliament said that doing so was \"giving in to terrorism\".[97] The Metropolitan Police honoured PC Palmer by retiring his shoulder number 4157U; Charlton Athletic F.C. announced that his season ticket seat at the Valley would not be occupied at the club's next home game, but would instead have a club scarf placed over it as a mark of respect.[102] A JustGiving fund was set up, with the target of raising £100,000 for his family, a goal attained in less than 24 hours.[66] A group called \"Muslims United for London\" also raised over £29,000 to support victims and victims' families, releasing a statement saying, \"The British Muslim community stands with the community during these difficult times\".[103][104][105] Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that PC Palmer would be remembered at the National Memorial Arboretum's UK Police Memorial in Staffordshire.[106] On 26 March, in an event organised by Women's March on London, roughly 100 women, including many Muslims, joined hands to form a chain along Westminster Bridge and stood in silence for five minutes to pay tribute to the victims of the attack.[109][110][111] Amber Rudd appeared on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show to call for government backdoor access to encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, which Masood used to send a message shortly before the attack. She announced a meeting with similar technology industry leaders for 30 March, where she would persuade them to voluntarily co-operate with the government. She refused to rule out passing new legislation to this end if the companies do not comply.[112][1] The BBC TV series Hospital was filming a routine meeting at St Mary's when the attack occurred; within minutes St Mary's declared a \"major incident\", one of several central London hospitals to do so. The cameras recorded the involvement of the emergency room and intensive care staff over the next few hours, and then followed the cases of three patients until their discharge. The hour-long episode was broadcast in June, resulting in \"a powerful, moving portrait of a major trauma centre’s response to such an event, and of the brilliant human beings who work

The This Morning host posted a photograph of the city’s iconic Palace of Westminster, his view as he walked across the bridge the following day, captioning the photograph: “Walking across Westminster Bridge in tribute and defiance.” Fans praised the presenter's meaningful sentiment, with one writing: “Well done! People should show those terrorists we shall stand strong and united!!”. Another follower said: “I knew you would do this Phil this makes you have that touch of class just that bit more much love,” while a third added: “Well done, we have to show people that they can't live in fear! #wearenotafraid.” Earlier in the day, Phillip spoke passionately to viewers on This Morning about the importance of carrying on with their lives and not letting fear win. Giving a powerful speech at the beginning of the programme, he spoke to the nation: “We are not afraid. It was a scene of tragedy, but among the harrowing images are heroes,” he said. “PC Keith Palmer, who lost his life while trying to protect our democracy. The doctors and nurses who ran towards the carnage to help. And the kindness of the passers by. They are the Britain we love, the country we know – the spirit that one man tried to destroy.” The show also saw Phillip and his co-presenter, Holly Willoughby, interview Tony Davis, a former soldier who performed CPR on PC Keith Palmer, one of the victims of the terror attack who sadly lost his life as a result of his injuries. The heroic man told the hosts how he had tried to save the life of the married father, saying: \"Initially when he fell to the ground, I put him in the recovery position, checked his pulse, he had a weak pulse, he had an initial head wound and another in his arm and another near his rib cage, that I believe was the fatal one. I put my raincoat underneath and tried to stem the blood as much as I could.\" Holly then broke down in tears as she questioned the brave man about the horrific incident, asking him: \"You're not a paramedic, you're not trained for this… How can you process that in your head?\" Tony said: \"Maybe tomorrow it'll sink in a bit. I stayed at the scene... everyone just came together. A great show of solidarity.\" One of Keith's former colleagues Nina Whitehead also appeared on the show to pay tribute to him. She said: \"I was the passenger and he was one of the police officers who actually saved my life. I owe him everything. He was a wonderful dad, and wonderful husband to his wife and everything.\" Latest comments Please note, all comments are those of readers and do not represent the opinion of Hellomagazine.com

{"originalUrl":"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/inlovingmemoryofaysha","text":"Weʼve raised £29,608 to provide an emergency fund for the two young children who lost their mother in the Westminster Attacks on Wednesday 22nd March 2017. Crowdfunding is a new type of fundraising where you can raise funds for your own personal cause, even if you're not a registered charity. The page owner is responsible for the distribution of funds raised. Story On Wednesday afternoon, Aysha Frade was on the way to collect her children from school when she was tragically killed in the attack on Westminster Bridge. We have seen so much compassion for all the families of the victims and this page will raise money to help Aysha’s children and family in their hour of need. MESSAGE FROM JUSTGIVING: We've been carefully monitoring all of the pages that have been created to help those affected by Wednesday's attack. We are ensuring that all of your kind donations are being used as intended. Because concerns were raised about this page, we are now managing it ourselves and reaching out to the family.

While their mummy can never be replaced, this effort can hopefully reduce some of the financial stress the family will now face.","title":"Crowdfunding to provide an emergency fund for the two young

{"originalUrl":"http://digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a824202/neighbours-london-week-westminster-terror-attack-addressed-on-air-announcement/","text":"Channel 5 first aired the episode at 1.45pm yesterday afternoon, just an hour before the tragic terror incident in London, which saw a lone attacker drive a vehicle into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and fatally stab a police officer. Four people, including the attacker, were killed in the incident while many more were injured. Staff from the real-life St Thomas' Hospital rushed to Westminster Bridge to help the injured yesterday, and have been widely praised for their actions. When Channel 5 repeated Wednesday's Neighbours episode at 5.30pm, an on-air continuity announcement was used to remind viewers that the episode had been filmed months ago and the London storyline was entirely coincidental. Channel 5's continuity announcer confirmed: \"Please be aware that today's episode of Neighbours was filmed before today's events in London.\" No cuts were made to the episode in its second airing, with footage of Toadie's accident and Karl's arrival at Westminster remaining in the edit. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, filmed his scenes at Westminster last October. Ryan Moloney, better known as Toadie, filmed all of his on-location scenes in London in January. Thursday's episode, due to air twice today on Channel 5 as usual, also contains further scenes set in St Thomas' Hospital – although these studio-based scenes were actually filmed at Neighbours HQ in Melbourne last year.","title":"Neighbours' London Week addresses Westminster terror attack on air with Channel 5

The attack left at least four dead and dozens injured. Photo: Stefan Rousseau/Associated Press. March 24th 2017 a year ago /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Network News/World/ Four people were killed in the London terror attack, and here’s some detail about the victims. Picture: Carl Court/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images AN Alice Springs jeweller has recalled how he and his family recently posed for a photo with the police officer killed in the terror attack on London. Andrew Thorogood was in the English capital in October and crossed paths with PC Keith Palmer when the family visited the Houses of Parliament. “We passed him on the way in and watched one of the debates, then on the way out we had to hand in our passes and we were waiting for Claire’s parents,” Mr Thorogood told the NT News. “I said ‘mate would you mind if we get a photo?’” “He picked up our accents and we told him where we were from. He said he’d love to take his family out to Australia one day and that’s when the girls said: ‘if you are ever out that way, come and look us up in Alice Springs’”. Mr Thorogood, originally from Townsville, met his wife Claire in Alice Springs when she was a backpacker, on holiday from the UK. The family visit Mrs Thorogood’s home country every year to help her parents harvest grapes, and the trip to London was a treat during one of their days off. “We have never felt unsafe in London,” Mr Thorogood said. “There’s always a heavy security presence up there these days but you know, how do you stop people driving a car?” He recognised the slain policeman when he was named in Australia on Thursday morning. Mr Thorogood still had the photo with PC Palmer on his phone. “It sends a shiver down your spine. You just think of how small the world is,” Mr Thorogood said. “He was there on the front gate and quite happy to be the face of the police. He seemed like a genuinely nice guy. We talked about the desert and Alice Springs. What it’s like in London and how he wished he could see the sunshine as much as we see the sunshine. It was just a general conversation.” Keith Palmer was a police officer killed during the terrorist attack. Already there is more than $500k raised for his family.Source:AP DEATH TOLL STANDS AT FOUR Meantime, four people were killed in the terror attack outside Britain’s parliament: a woman picking up her children from school, a man from Utah, a 75-year-old man, and an unarmed police officer. Westminster Bridge, where the attacker mowed down pedestrians before stabbing a police officer, is a busy tourist spot with its views of parliament’s Big Ben clock tower. Those injured in the attack included many foreigners. Here is what we know about the victims so far. ‘Hero’ police officer Unarmed police officer Keith Palmer, who was fatally stabbed as he stood guard at an entrance to parliament, has been hailed as a hero. The 48-year-old husband and father had been a police officer for 15 years and was part of the parliamentary protection force. He previously served in the British army alongside James Cleverly, now a Conservative MP, who tweeted: “A lovely man, a friend. I’m heartbroken.” As a tribute, Charlton Athletic football club placed a scarf in its red and white colours on Seat 166 of its stadium, which Palmer held as a season ticket holder. Thousands of people also donated money to Palmer’s family via a crowdfunding page set up by the police force union. Within a day, it had already collected more than $500,000. Facebook photo of Aysha Frade who was killed on the Westminster Bridge. Picture: FacebookSource:Facebook Mother-of-two Colleagues of Aysha Frade, a mother who was run down and killed as she was on her way to pick up her children, said she was “loved” and would be “deeply missed”. A Spanish diplomatic source confirmed to AFP that Frade was a 43-year-old British national whose mother was Spanish. Media reports said her daughters were seven and nine years old. Rachel Borland, principal of DLD College London where Frade worked in the administration team, said she was “highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues”. Kurt Cochran was in London celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary with wife Melissa (right).Picture: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFPSource:AFP ‘A great American’ Kurt Cochran from Utah in the United States has been named as the third victim. US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to pay tribute to “a great American” adding that his “prayers and condolences are with the family and friends”. Clint Payne, Cochran’s brother-in-law, explained in a statement that Cochran and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran had been in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. “Our family is heartbroken,” he said in a statement emailed to AFP. Cochran’s wife is reportedly in hospital, where she is recovering from a broken leg and rib and a cut on her head. The police said only that a man in his 50s had died. Melissa Payne Cochran can be seen bleeding on the front page of the New York Post after the London attack. Picture: New York PostSource:Supplied A 75-year-old man who was injured in the attack died of his wounds on Thursday evening, police said. “The man had been receiving medical treatment in hospital following the attack and life support was withdrawn this evening,” police said in a statement, without giving further details of the victim’s background. DOZENS INJURED Police said 29 of around 40 people wounded were treated in hospital. Seven remained in “critical condition” on Thursday. Four of the five Koreans who were injured in the attack have been released from hospital, according to The Korea Herald. Three Korean women and one man suffered broken bones during the attack. All were aged in their 50s and 60s. The four people discharged will return home on Saturday. The fifth person is awaiting a progress report after undergoing an operation. Ms Neis-Beer, 54, who has a 26-year-old son called Jordan and a 19-year-old daughter called Paige and who works in an organic market and cafe in Stirling in Adelaide, was one of those injured in the first mass-casualty terrorism attacks on British soil in more than a decade. She is currently recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a crushed foot but is in good spirits, Australian High Commissioner to the UK Alexander Downer told Channel Seven’s Sunrise program on Friday morning In an odd coincidence, Mr Downer said Ms Neis-Beer lived in the Adelaide Hills town where he was born, Bridgewater. South Australian woman Patricia or “Trish” Neis-Beer was injured in the Westminster Bridge terror attack. Picture: SuppliedSource:News Corp Australia “I have been to the place where she works to have a coffee on many an occasion,” he said. “She is well known to many of us in the Adelaide Hills. “It is quite a coincidence that she should have been here on that occasion. Mr Downer said Ms Neis-Beer was being well cared for and the consulate was providing her with assistance. “In these sorts of circumstances, we don’t want to be doing more for her than she wants, we want to make sure she is properly looked after and cared for,” he said. “At the moment, at the hospital she is in she is being well looked after. The quality of care is very good and we keep an eye on her.” Dramatic footage shows a woman identified as Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, 29, plummeting six meters into the freezing River Thames as a speeding car flies past, smashing into pedestrians on the bridge. Andreea Cristea, 29, plummeted into the River Thames. Picture: FacebookSource:Supplied The Port of London Authority said she was in a critical condition and was given emergency care on a pier before being rushed to hospital. The British media is reporting that Ms Cristea was in London with her fiance Andrei Burnaz to celebrate his birthday today. Mr Burnaz is reported to have suffered a minor injury. Paul Ciocoiu, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Romania, told Digi 24 TV: “According to information we have, she (Ms Cristea) would be the pedestrian hit by a car and thrown into the Thames and then recovered. Ministry contacted the family. “We do not know when the family arrived in Britain. If the family require consular assistance, of course, the ministry provides help punctually. “There is a crisis cell set up immediately after the conclusion of the terrorist attack. There are the usual procedures, to keep in touch with British authorities, hospital authorities and family seriously injured citizen.” Three French pupils on a school trip to London, all aged 15 or 16, were among those hurt, including two who suffered broken bones but were not reported to be in life-threatening condition.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault arrived in London on Thursday to visit them. Five South Korean tourists — four women and a man in their 50s and 60s — were also wounded after being knocked to the ground by people fleeing as the assailant mowed down pedestrians, Seoul said. In an address to parliament on Thursday, May said that among the people admitted to hospital were 12 Britons as well as two Greeks and two Romanians, one German, one Pole, one Irish citizen, one Chinese national, one Italian and one American. Four people were killed in the attack by ‘lone wolf’ killer Khalid Masood, 52.Picture: Carl Court/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images A woman with serious injuries rescued from the River Thames near Westminster Bridge after the attack, as well as her fiance, are believed to be the two Romanians. Local media in the eastern European country have named them as Andreea Cristea, a 29 year-old architect and Andrei Burnez. Authorities did not confirm the reports. The injured also included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in serious condition.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.searchforthetruth.co.uk/westminster-bridge","text":"Have we been told the truth about the alleged terror attack on Westminster Bridge, London in March 2017? The incidence occurred on 3/22 (March 22) 2017, exactly a year after the Brussels terror event on the same day last year, that in itself is very suspicious. The video and photo evidence of the Westminster attack suggests it was all staged and the only death may have been the Policeman’s. He may have been sacrificed to give the whole event some reality. False flag staged attacks are psychological warfare operations targeting the minds of the masses. Fabricated events can be used to further an agenda of the deep state and the perpetrators typically include CIA, MI6, MI5, MOSSAD, and DGSE (French Intelligence). The Muslim or Arab patsie is sent there to do the crime or blackmailed into doing it to enforce the idea to the world that the “boogieman” Muslim terrorist is still real. If this was a white man that allegedly drove this car along the bridge then it would not be classed as a terrorist event, only because this man was classed as a ‘Muslim’ is it then labelled a terror event. Look at the incident in Times Square, New York on May 18th 2017 were a man mowed down 20 pedestrians and killing one, it was labelled by Police as not a terrorist incident in fact New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said there was \"no indication\" it was an act of terrorism and this was because the perpetrator was not a Muslim. We are told the person who carried out the Westminster attack was Khalid Masood (Adrian Russell Elms) who was a Christian until he allegedly converted to Islam in 2005, so he is not really a Muslim. What did this Muslim have to gain from this event, what was his objective in carrying it out, well he had none whatsoever. These false flags are now becoming so obvious with so many mistakes. The mainstream media never bothers to bring up the anomalies or mistakes just like they did with 9/11 or 7/7 and that is because they are controlled and they are there to repeat the governments version of events. Let us look at 13 reasons why this could be a fabricated or staged event. 1.Suspicious Video. The first piece of evidence is the video below which shows the only footage known of the car that was reported to have been involved in the Westminster terrorist attack. First the car looks more like a cartoon or ghost car in comparison to the other vehicles on the bridge. The video is below if you want to look at it. Look at the splash in the water on the video below, the splash is followed by a black streak. What is the black streak or trail? It is CGI, not real. Notice how the person (if it was a person) jumped into the water after the car has already gone by. Research has shown that the building were this video was taken was the upper half of the Milbank Tower which houses the Government/Political agencies. In the past and in the present Milbank Tower has been used by a cluster of predominantly political organisations including the Conservative and Labour parties and the United Nations to name a few. Today it hosts a wide range of companies from PR agencies to the Ministry of Justice Records Management Service. One company in the Milbank Tower is Altitude London which was opened by former PM David Cameron in 2010. Altitude states on its own website it is: “A firm supporter of the UK film industry and arts in general, Altitude has helped some of the foremost film and television production companies gain footage that is just not possible anywhere else”. So we are led to believe the person who took this video just happened to have a video camera pointed at Westminster Bridge when this alleged car started its journey. What a coincidence? I don’t think so, they were part of the staged attack. The one thing that looks really odd is that the attacker was able to drive at speed over Westminster Bridge and mow down pedestrians. It is a very busy bridge – why was it empty enough for anyone to drive at speed at that hour? It should have been jam packed with traffic – you would be lucky to do 10mph! If one looks at the pictures afterwards, there are several buses and cars stopped on the South bound lane … but almost nothing stopped on the North bound lane used by the attacker, that lane is almost empty. What a coincidence? 2.SuspiciousPhotographers. Did you know nearly all the photographs of the Westminster attack which were used by the media were taken by Toby Melville a photographer for Reuters based in London? Reuters Media, we know is owned by the Rothschild’s. You could say Melville is an elite photographer because he took the photo of Kate Middleton’s baby when it was first shown to the world as well as many photos of the Queen and Obama when he visited the Queen. Melville took the photo which shows a woman’s pair of legs (it was a mannequin) sticking out from under a bus during the Westminster attack. Other photographs of the events of the attack were taken by one Stefan Rouseau who states on his website that he has spent the past 15 years travelling with and taking photographs of the Prime Minister. So all the photographs of the Westminster attack were taken by trusted Government/Royal photographers, two high profile insiders. There is no footage from people’s phones and they would be because on the other side of the road there was a queue of traffic with several buses, so someone would have taken videos and photos but there is none available. 3. The Woman under the Bus The two pair of legs sticking out from under the bus do not belong to a human being, it is a dummy or mannequin. We are told this woman got hit by a car and then the front wheels of a double decker bus went over this woman and then the back wheels went over this woman. Does any sensible person believe that? Where is the blood, if a 12 ton bus went over you twice there would be blood and your body would be squashed? It is not believable. It looks like this dummy was placed under the bus for shock effect meant to manipulate public consciousness. As mention earlier this photo was taken by Toby Melville. The hand looks to white to be the hand of a human and why would your shoes be off? I love the way the cop is just walking by as if nothing has happened! Just a double-decker bus driving over someone, nothing special, don’t’ even try to help her. \"I can tell you the girl under the bus is bullshit, a fact! I used to be a fireman in London many years ago, and seen some real gory shit, trains that ran over people, trucks, all sorts. If she had been run over as depicted, she would have been flat, and there would have been a mass pool of blood and shit, up to a 3 to 4 meter radius of her body with all sorts splattered everywhere, be like you standing on a fly only much bigger of course. That picture is taking the piss for sure! \" – Ex London Fireman 4. The Lady in Pink Now this piece of evidence for me makes this Westminster attack to be nothing more than a false flag hoax. Now there is a few videos on Youtube which shows videos of someone moving along Westminster Bridge just after the alleged car mowed down pedestrians. It shows alleged injured people on the floor been attended to by members of the public. Below is a screenshot of an alleged injured person been attended to and standing near is a lady in pink holding her arms up taking photos and near her is a man also taking photos and he has blue\\grey jeans and a dark grey jacket on. At the point that the lady in the pink jacket is taking photos, the car that allegedly mowed down all the pedestrians has already gone along past were she is standing because there is an injured person already near her on the floor. A screenshot is below. Do you get that, the lady in pink was not hit by the car. Now there is a another video of her lying injured in the same spot with blood near her as if she has been hit by the car and the same man standing next to her taking the photos is now acting as her helper. The screen shot is below of her lying injured. She was not hit by the car, it is a staged scene and she is an actor and probably paid huge sums for this fakery. Notice the man helping her, it is the same man who was stood near her taking photos. Also would you really take photos if there was someone lying next to you injured? 5. The Shoes Shoes were placed into a scene for some unknown reason. Since when does a car hitting you knock your shoes off? Here we have a photo which shows a man being attended to and there are no shoes by the side of the road. We now see a photo of the same man being attended to but this time with shoes carefully placed by the side of the road. Who placed the shoes there neatly and why? Take a closer look at this picture. In the video online the man’s backside never touches the road underneath (that his hard to do), his knees are up and so is his left arm and hand, he does not seem to move. If he was in pain his knees would be resting on the ground, flopped over to the left or right and so would his left arm. It takes a lot of effort to stay in the position he is in, it is not believable. Look at the photo above, does the hand look real. It is to white, is it a dummy? The video is below which shows this more clearly. Also as you watch these videos going along Westminster Bridge there is not many people injured but we are told that over 40 people were injured, somehow I don’t think so. Video was removed by the Jewish run Youtube, sorry. You have got to ask why? 6. Strange Photos Look at the photo below. If this is a dead Policeman under the white sheet then why is he left alone this is supposed to be a crime scene, why is it not cordoned off with tape? Why is the ambulance empty? Why is the member of the public attending to the dying Policeman but the Doctor and Paramedics are just watching? In the photo below look at the man with the blue gloves he is holding the Policeman up by his feet now the Policemans head must be touching the floor. Why? We are told there was 44 victims? In the photos below were are these victims? 7. No CCTV, again! London has more CCTV per square mile than any city in the world, so where’s the footage of this incident? The CCTV cameras for Westminster were taken off-line during the attack. CCTV offline? Again? It’s the same old story, just like London 7/7 underground bombings, no CCTV. CCTV on board the bus that blew up was also offline. The same Israeli Company who ran 911 airport security (No CCTV), ran the London bus CCTV during the attack. Of course they were taken offline as they don’t want the people who monitor the CCTV to see what actually happened on the Bridge. This alleged car that came onto the bridge must have came from somewhere in London. So where is the CCTV of this car approaching the bridge from its starting point, well they can't show it can they. London has more CCTV than any city in the world per population. 8. No Security The main gate into the grounds of parliament was left open and reportedly nobody was guarding the gate. Normally these gates are always kept shut. Why was the main gate into the grounds of parliament left open and why was nobody guarding the gate? There are claims that no-one was on duty on the gate when the attacker entered. That place is a fortress. There is no way anyone could get into that area. There are armed guards at every entrance. At least four staff are usually stationed at all the gates, two outside and two inside. How did he get inside those gates? No one can enter that region. How could he knife down a constable? 9. The London Eye The London Eye was stopped during the Westminster attack for 3 hours. Whoever was behind the attacks had the London Eye stopped because if someone on the London Eye took a video of what really happened on the bridge then got off the London Eye with this evidence and disappeared, the this evidence could be the used at some point to prove the hoax. To stop this happening the London eye was stopped and as people got off their phones were checked by the Police to make sure they had no evidence of the alleged car driving along the bridge at high speed. 10. The Shot Assailant: Lack of Blood There was first news of the assailant being a Mr. Abu Izzadeen but later identity of killed assailant was given as Khalid Masood. The man originally alleged to be the main attacker, Trevor Brooks aka Abu Izzadeen, has links to MI6. The media found out they made a blunder and that Abu Izzadeen was alive in jail. But there is no real blood anywhere, including on the knife which was used to stab a Police officer. Where are the bullet wounds? His eyes are open, is he dead? Where is all the blood? The terrorist was shot – not taken into interrogation, because he had to be disposed of – as in Nice, Berlin, Paris 13 Nov. 2015, Brussels 3/22 2016 etc. Maybe that is why they always kill him or get him killed: So that the alleged perpetrator isn’t alive to explain what really happened. At first, there were two assailants:”The BBC understands from multiple sources that two assailants were in the vehicle on Westminster Bridge,” BBC correspondent Dominic Casciani said on Twitter. What happened to the other guy? 11. Iconic date Another sign of a false flag is the “iconic date,” often featuring the numbers 9, 11 or 7 or multiples thereof. The London bombings happened on 7/7 and we of course we have 9/11. The Westminster attack happened on 3/22, the first anniversary of the false flag attack in Brussels Airport which was also 3/22, 3+2+2=7. 322 is a big time satanic number and date, is the identifier of the Skull and Bones secret society of which many American Presidents were a member of. In the recent terror attack at Manchester Arena, the date was 22/05. 2+2+5=9. The truck attack in Stockholm, Sweden happened on April 7 th. 7+4=11 and the Berlin truck attack happened on the 9 th. Is it all just a coincidence? Believe me the same organisation planned all the attacks and then convinced some patsie to carry it out and it was not Isis or Al Qaeda. The Illuminati and its intelligent (Psychopaths) agencies such as Mossad, CIA, MI5 and MI6 were behind all these attacks. What are the chances that the 8 attacks below spread out over 6 years in 6 different countries would all be carried out on the 22nd of the month? It is not possible that these were random events. Norway attack- 22-07-11 Lee Rigby – 22-05-2013 Pakistan tourist shooting – 22-06-13 Canada shootings parliament – 22-10-14 Brussels attack – 22-03-16 Munich attack – 22-07-16 London Westminster attack- 22-03-17 Manchester Arena attack- 22-05-17 Just to note that the 22 nd is a very significant date for the Jews because that was the date they blew up the British headquarters at the King David hotel (July 22 nd, 1946) and killed 91 civilians. Also these Jewish terrorists tried to make people believe that the Arabs did it (akin to 9/11) by dressing up as Palestinian Arabs to plant the bombs. In July 2006 Netanyahu and former Irgun gang members attended a 60th anniversary celebration of this outrage and continue to claim that it was all the fault of the British and not the fault of the bombers. 12. Terror Drills Every major terrorist incident has had terror drills or training at exactly the same time as the terror incident was happening. 9/11 did so did 7/7 London, Boston, Paris etc.. and so did Westminster. 13. Israel Connection Every terror event from Manchester to Nice seems to get blamed on ISIS or ISIS claims responsibility. Did you know that an Israeli group SITE (Search for International Terrorist Entities) always announces first that terror events like Westminster, Manchester and Nice were allegedly done by ISIS. Can we really believe them? In fact any ISIS related news come from SITE first. It is run by a Jewish woman Rita Katz whose father was a Mossad spy. Look at this message that SITE tweeted before the Westminster attacks, seems they knew this would happen before it did. Well that’s no coincidence when you realise that ISIS was created by Israel and America. Or maybe it was just a Mossad (Israeli Intelligence) operation from the start. Click on the ISIS section of this website to see more information on that. Why do these events happen? My research says the ones behind the planning of this event were Mossad (Israeli Intelligence) with the help of MI5 and MI6. It is a psychological operation to keep in the minds of the masses of people and politicians that the Muslims are the real threat and that gives Israel the support it needs to slaughter the Palestinians and gives a legitimate reason to keep the wars in the Middle East rolling along, more Muslims slaughtered (4 million since 1990). But there are other reasons. After the Westminster attack Home Secretary Amber Rudd has demanded more action from social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Youtube to take down extremist videos, really she means videos that expose the false flag lies so no one will be able to find out the truth. She said new proposals are going to be implemented by the government to make internet giants take down so called hate videos. But in reality they are not hate videos but truth videos that try to expose the lies of the government. Also in government plans in the wake of this alleged attack is to deploy 5000 soldiers on the streets of the UK. This secret plan is codenamed Operation Temperer. The attack stopped parliament from voting on leaving the EU. So it disrupted the Brexit debate. Terror attacks also keep us divided especially Muslims and Christians. These terror attacks are happening in Christian countries in Europe and America and we are told the perpetrators are always Muslims. But who would profit from Muslims and Christians hating each other? Could it be the people of Asia or could it be the Jewish Zionists? Could it be a prelude to the coming Economic Collapse? The global elites know full well that the Global Economic & Financial System is on the verge of collapse and that the banksters in London are the primary culprits. Hence, they feel compelled to put into place all of the controls and safeguards, laws and technology necessary to preclude a replay of the French Revolution … … … in London France announced that in the wake of the so-called “Charlie Hebdo Shooting,” it passed a controversial new bill granting security agencies unprecedented powers to tap the communications of France’s population without judicial overview. This would have been Impossible to pass without having the Charlie Hebdo Shooting. Once again, CCTV cameras were missing, drills and events that mimic the event played out just days earlier, and, the aftermath, the loss of personal freedoms and freedom of speech, plus troops on our streets being proposed. Dr. Kevin Barrett, a founding member of the Scientific Panel for the Investigation of 9/11, made these remarks in an interview with Press TV when he was asked to name the biggest false flag operations of 2015. “2015 saw an outrageous number of false flag events, and the two biggest ones were the attacks in Paris, France; the second attack in Paris on November 13 was followed up quickly by a sequel attack in San Bernardino, California,” Dr. Barrett said. “It seems that the people behind the so-called war on terror, and that would be neoconservative Zionists, have decided to use Paris as their center of operations, or at least this past year they did,” he added. “I think that was perhaps because Paris is perhaps the capital of world secularism, and they are trying to stir up a strategy of tensions pitting Islam against the West, and in particular against the secular tendencies of the West,” he stated. “They are concerned that many progressive intellectuals… are turning against Zionism.” French youth turning against Zionism Dr. Barrett, an editor at Veterans Today, said “Alain Soral is absolutely right when he says in a new book that I am editing on the Paris attacks, Another French False Flag, that they chose victims in these trendy youth neighborhoods of Paris – young people who were partying at a rock concert, young people who were hanging out at cafes – because these young people in the 11th Arrondissement of Paris are precisely the demographic in France that has been turning against Zionism and supporting the Palestinians.” “So I think that Paris was targeted as the new fulcrum in this clash of civilizations in order to continue to try to push the West into the Zionist camp, and bring the West into a long-term war on Islam on behalf of Israel,” he noted. Isis\\Daesh exposed as false flag group Dr. Barrett said that “regarding other false flag stories of this year, many of them are also related to the same theme.” “I think the other great false flag story of 2015 is that the so-called Islamic States (Daesh/ISIS) has been exposed as a false flag group. It has been exposed in many many ways, as essentially a band of cutthroat mercenaries organized by the West in order to destabilize the Middle East and particularly to destabilize and even to depopulate the countries on the borders of Israel in support of the Greater Israel project, in which Israel is trying to expand and ultimately occupy everything from the Nile to Euphrates,” he stated. “Daesh has been exposed in so many ways, and in particular by the intervention of Russia in Syria. The Russians have potentially blown the whistle on the fact that the US war on Daesh was a fake. In 2015, we learnt that Daesh is a fake false flag group and the war on Daesh by the West was phony,” the analyst pointed out. “So I think these were the biggest false flag stories of the year 2015.”","title":"westminster-bridge","tokens":["Have","told","truth","alleged","terror","attack","Westminster","Bridge","London","March","2017","The","incidence","occurred","3/22","March","22","2017","exactly","year","Brussels","terror","event","day","last","year","suspicious","The","video","photo","evidence","Westminster","attack","suggests","staged","death","may","Policemans","He","may","sacrificed","give","whole","event","reality","False","flag","staged","attacks","psychological","warfare","operations","targeting","minds","masses","Fabricated","events","used","agenda","deep","state","perpetrators","typically","include","CIA","MI6","MI5","MOSSAD","DGSE","French","Intelligence","The","Muslim","Arab","patsie","sent","crime","blackmailed","enforce","idea","world","boogieman","Muslim","terrorist","still","real","If","white","man","allegedly","drove","car","along","bridge","would","classed","terrorist","event","man","classed","Muslim","labelled","terror","event","Look","incident","Times","Square","New","York","May","18th","2017","man","mowed","20","pedestrians","killing","one","labelled","Police","terrorist","incident","fact","New","York","Mayor","Bill","de","Blasio","indication","act","terrorism","perpetrator","Muslim","We","told","person","carried","Westminster","attack","Khalid","Masood","Adrian","Russell","Elms","Christian","allegedly","converted","Islam","2005","really","Muslim","What","Muslim","gain","event","objective","carrying","well","none","whatsoever","These","false","flags","becoming","obvious","many","mistakes","The","mainstream","media","never","bothers","bring","anomalies","mistakes","like","9/11","7/7","controlled","repeat","governments","version","events","Let","us","look","13","reasons","fabricated","staged","event","1.Suspicious","Video","The","first","piece","evidence","video","shows","footage","known","car","reported","involved","Westminster","terrorist","attack","First","car","looks","like","cartoon","ghost","car","comparison","vehicles","bridge","The","video","want","look","Look","splash","water","video","splash","followed","black","streak","What","black","streak","trail","It","CGI","real","Notice","person","person","jumped","water","car","already","gone","Research","shown","building","video","taken","upper","half","Milbank","Tower","houses","Government/Political","agencies","In","past","present","Milbank","Tower","used","cluster","predominantly","political","organisations","including","Conservative","Labour","parties","United","Nations","name","Today","hosts","wide","range","companies","PR","agencies","Ministry","Justice","Records","Management","Service","One","company","Milbank","Tower","Altitude","London","opened","former","PM","David","Cameron","2010","Altitude","states","website","A","firm","supporter","UK","film","industry","arts","general","Altitude","helped","foremost","film","television","production","companies","gain","footage","possible","anywhere","else","So","led","believe","person","took","video","happened","video","camera","pointed","Westminster","Bridge","alleged","car","started","journey","What","coincidence","I","dont","think","part","staged","attack","The","one","thing","looks","really","odd","attacker","able","drive","speed","Westminster","Bridge","mow","pedestrians","It","busy","bridge","empty","enough","anyone","drive","speed","hour","It","jam","packed","traffic","would","lucky","10mph","If","one","looks","pictures","afterwards","several","buses","cars","stopped","South","bound","lane","almost","nothing","stopped","North","bound","lane","used","attacker","lane","almost","empty","What","coincidence","2.SuspiciousPhotographers","Did","know","nearly","photographs","Westminster","attack","used","media","taken","Toby","Melville","photographer","Reuters","based","London","Reuters","Media","know","owned","Rothschilds","You","say","Melville","elite","photographer","took","photo","Kate","Middletons","baby","first","shown","world","well","many","photos","Queen","Obama","visited","Queen","Melville","took","photo","shows","womans","pair","legs","mannequin","sticking","bus","Westminster","attack","Other","photographs","events","attack","taken","one","Stefan","Rouseau","states","website","spent","past","15","years","travelling","taking","photographs","Prime","Minister","So","photographs","Westminster","attack","taken","trusted","Government/Royal","photographers","two","high","profile","insiders","There","footage","peoples","phones","would","side","road","queue","traffic","several","buses","someone","would","taken","videos","photos","none","available","3","The","Woman","Bus","The","two","pair","legs","sticking","bus","belong","human","dummy","mannequin","We","told","woman","got","hit","car","front","wheels","double","decker","bus","went","woman","back","wheels","went","woman","Does","sensible","person","believe","Where","blood","12","ton","bus","went","twice","would","blood","body","would","squashed","It","believable","It","looks","like","dummy","placed","bus","shock","effect","m

US President Donald Trump who apologised for being late to a meeting due to being kept updated on events in the UK left it to his press officer Sean Spicer to give the official White House response. “The President has been briefed on the situation in London. The city of London and her Majesty’s government have the full support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack and in bringing those to justice who are responsible.” My thoughts are with all those affected by the horrific attack at the very heart of #London. #NATO stands united against terrorism. With the events unfolding in London on the anniversary of the terror attacks in Brussels, it was an emotional EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker who was asked to comment: “The fact that exactly the same day, something similar happened in London and to London, is really putting me in the situation of someone who has a language that doesn’t have the words enough to express what I am deeply feeling.”","title":"Westminster attack condemned abroad |

People need to know how to react in an emergency.” Extra measures including SAS soldiers training cabinet ministers how to react during terrorist attacks may also be carried out. The SAS already has a permanent presence in the capital, with regular troops working in London. Both HQ Squadron and A Squadron of the reservist 21 SAS Regiment are also located in the city. The increased threat of urban terrorism saw the SAS operating bizarre-looking helicopters over central London in 2016.The unusual-looking Osprey V22 aircraft – which is effectively half plane, half helicopter – were flown and up and down the Thames several times in May.

Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP The media regulator has found that Channel 4 News seriously breached the broadcasting code by naming the wrong man as the Westminster terror attacker, and has heavily criticised the programme for a string of major mistakes in recent years. Ofcom has taken the highly unusual step of forcing Channel 4 News to make an on-air broadcast of the outcome of its investigation. The programme reported that Abu Izzadeen, an Islamist activist formerly known as Trevor Brooks, was the person responsible for the terror attack who had been shot dead by police. During coverage of the attack in March, which left four people dead, Simon Israel, Channel 4 News’s senior home affairs correspondent, identified Izzadeen as the attacker. Later in the programme Jon Snow, the newsreader, interrupted the broadcast to issue a correction saying that Izzadeen’s brother had been in contact to say that he was, in fact, still in jail. “Sorry to cut you off. We’ve got a little bit more on this fast-developing story about today’s attack in Westminster,” said Snow. “Channel 4 News has been contacted by Abu Izzadeen’s brother, who tells this programme that he is in fact still serving a prison sentence. That from Yusuf Brooks, brother of Trevor Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen.” Snow apologised at the end of the programme, which was subsequently pulled from the Channel 4+1 service. “We found Channel 4 News committed a serious breach of broadcasting rules, after it wrongly identified the Westminster terror attacker,” said Ofcom in a statement. “Channel 4 News incorrectly referred to the same person throughout its report, and subsequent steps to mitigate the error were insufficient.” In a statement, the broadcaster said the mistake came during a “fast-moving story” and that Channel 4 News had “moved swiftly to correct and clarify the facts as conflicting information came to light”. “We note that Ofcom acknowledges Channel 4 News made appropriate corrections while on air; removed the programme from other platforms and carried a full correction and apology the following day,” said a spokeswoman. “We are working with Channel 4 News to review and improve their existing editorial and oversight procedures.” Channel 4 News said it had not made an apology or offered payment for reputational damage done to Izzadeen in the case of mistaken identity. A spokeswoman added that the programme had not received any request or demand for financial amends or an apology from or on behalf of Izzadeen. The programme also said no action was taken against Simon Israel over the on-air gaffe, and that he continues to report in the same role. The media regulator took the unusual step of ordering Channel 4 News to broadcast its decision because it is the latest in a string of accuracy lapses in recent years. It is very rare for Ofcom to order such a public broadcast of a decision – especially against one of the UK’s most high-profile and respected news organisations. “This is the fourth time in three years we have found Channel 4 in breach of its requirement to report news with due accuracy,” said Ofcom. “We are particularly concerned that another serious breach has happened, given Channel 4’s previous assurances to Ofcom that improvements to its compliance processes were being made. Considering the seriousness of this breach, we are requiring Channel 4 News to air a summary of our breach decision.” The spokeswoman for Channel 4 News, which is produced by ITN, said: “Channel 4 News takes its obligations under the Ofcom Broadcasting Code extremely seriously and is committed to providing audiences with high-quality, accurate and impartial news programming. “We have participated fully in Ofcom’s investigation and note the regulator’s ruling which takes into account the immediate steps taken to correct and clarify the error during the course of the programme.” A 2014 news report covering the publication of the Ellison review in to possible corruption and the role of undercover policing in the Metropolitan police in the Stephen Lawrence case. Short interview clips with five supposedly random members of the public asking whether they trusted the police turned out to all be from the same organisation, with which the reporter had links. A 2014 report on Russia’s assertive military and foreign policy that included an audio clip supposedly of an RAF pilot intercepting and warning a Russian military plane in British airspace.

{"originalUrl":"http://mashable.com/2017/03/26/uk-westminster-attack-whatsapp/#gasvt0Thziq5","text":"\"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other,\" she said. \"It used to be that people would steam open envelopes or listen in on phones when they wanted to find out what people were doing, legally, through warrantry [sic]. But in this situation, we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.\" Rudd's comment came after media reports on Sunday that the Westminster Bridge attacker had sent a WhatsApp message prior to the incident that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted. Fifty-two-year-old Briton Khalid Masood used a car and a knife to carry out an attack in the heart of London on Wednesday that left four people dead. He was killed by law enforcement on the scene. Rudd said she was not arguing for the government to access all messages on such platforms. Instead, she wants encrypted services to recognise they have a responsibility to engage with law enforcement agencies to counter terrorism. \"They cannot get away with saying 'we are a different situation,'\" she said. \"They are not.\" A WhatsApp spokesperson said the company was horrified at the London attack, adding that it is \"cooperating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations.\" \"Compelling companies to put backdoors into encrypted services would make millions of ordinary people less secure online.\" The rhetoric on Sunday highlighted a clash between digital privacy and national security that has been playing out globally in recent years. The most famous case so far has been Apple's tussle with the FBI. In 2016, the security service took on the Silicon Valley giant in an attempt to bypass the lock screen of the iPhone 5C used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook. Farook and his wife killed 14 people and wounded 22 more in San Bernardino, California in Dec., 2015. The U.S. Justice Department obtained a court order ordering Apple to assist the FBI in bypassing the phone's security, fearing that too many attempts to guess the passcode would wipe the phone's memory. Security experts warn that building a backdoor into the iPhone or services like WhatAspp would compromise the safety of users in unintended ways: If UK police can somehow read encrypted messages, for example, what's to prevent law enforcement in countries with a poor human rights record from demanding the same level of access? The UK-based digital rights advocate Open Rights Group has warned that undermining encryption would make ordinary internet activities more vulnerable. \"Compelling companies to put backdoors into encrypted services would make millions of ordinary people less secure online,\" the group's executive director, Jim Killock, said in a statement. \"We all rely on encryption to protect our ability to communicate, shop and bank safely.\" The UK already has extensive laws allowing the government access to the internet footprint of its citizens. In late 2016, it passed the Investigatory Powers Act, also known as the Snoopers' Charter. The bill creates a quasi-internet history database that's accessible to law enforcement upon request, among other measures. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A normal day in Parliament, very busy, very bustling. \"The divisional bell went and MPs were migrating to the chamber then we heard a sound you never expect to hear - anywhere, let alone in Parliament - that was high-velocity gunshots that caused understandable panic and chaos. \"I found myself coming out to where the incident was unfolding to find police officers, including Pc Keith Palmer, who every day deal with the public and tourists and are part of our community, had then moved into operational mode. \"There was a gunline of about 30 guns, all trained towards the gates themselves. \"Beyond that, that's where I saw Pc Keith Palmer was on the ground and he was bleeding and a couple of officers were trying to help. That's when I ran forward.\" Tobias Ellwood is visibly emotional on BBC BreakfastCredit: BBC Mr Ellwood added: \"I didn't feel I did anything more than was the product of my training and background. \"I am medically trained. I saw what was going on , so I stepped forward. I was one of many people that stepped forward that day to do what we could. It's the heroes of the police force who guarded Parliament. \"But very sadly, the injuries that Pc Keith Palmer had sustained were just too complicated. \"We had a wave of medics come through and then a helicopter landed in Parliament Square. \"And still, we were unable to save his life. And it's a profound regret that that happened.\" He struggles to control his emotions during the interviewCredit: BBC Asked about how he explained the attack to his family, Mr Ellwood said: \"A vivid image I have is returning home after what had happened and finding my son on the top of the stairs and he was in tears and he was on his own.\" Pausing for a moment to compose himself, he added with his voice breaking: \"I sat next to him and he just asked 'why?'. \"He couldn't understand why I stepped forward, why somebody had been killed, why somebody was wielding a knife in a place he had visited many times. \"All I could offer was 'there are some bad people in the world, but there are a lot more good people and it's the good people who win'.\" As he was thanked for sharing his \"raw emotions\" by interviewer Charlie Stayt, a tear rolled down Mr Ellwood's cheek. A tear runs down Mr Ellwood's cheekCredit: BBC UK is dealing with 'dark chapter' of terrorism Mr Ellwood also warned that the threats faced by the UK are not going away and involve not just terrorism, but \"resurgent nations challenging the world order\". Describing how the UK is going through a \"dark chapter\" facing the terrorist threat, he paid tribute to the police for their work in a country \"that seems to be getting more dangerous and more volatile\". Mr Ellwood, who has lobbied within government for extra funding for the Armed Forces, said: \"There are some big questions, wider questions, about what we do because this terrorist attack - non-state, caused by Daesh - they are not going away. \"These attacks will continue unless we step forward and actually participate, become more pro-active in dealing with what is a very changing and dark chapter that we are enduring.\" He told BBC Radio 4's Today: \"From 2002 to today, extremism is still there. We are still not able to better understand why people with a scant understanding of Islam are able to be recruited with a false promise of a fast-track to paradise. \"Until that is grasped, until we can better ensure that the peaceful religion of Islam is better understood - probably at a very younger age - so these people aren't recruited, this threat will continue.\" The threats faced around the world meant \"the relative peace that we have had for the last three or four decades is going to be challenged\", Mr Ellwood said. \"We are in a difficult time at the moment, there's no doubt about it,\" he added. 'Hero' police officers 'defending Parliament' Mr Ellwood was walking through the Palace of Westminster when Masood ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing unarmed police officer Pc Palmer a year ago on Thursday. He praised the work of the police on duty that day: \"They were the ones that were defending Parliament and us, huge tribute to them. \"They get up every day, they don't know how their day is going to unfold.\" #LondonUnited: Memorial tribute to vicims and survivors of attacks Plans have been revealed for a memorial for victims and survivors of the four terror attacks in London last year. Well-wishers will be able to leave messages in a digital book of hope at City Hall from Thursday, a year since Khalid Masood's attack in Westminster. Members of the public will be able to send messages to the installation - which will remain open until June - using #LondonUnited on social media, and their words will be projected on to a map of the capital. The tribute has been set up to mark the four terrorist atrocities that took place in the city last year - at Westminster Bridge, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green. The phrase #LondonUnited will be projected on to the Houses of Parliament, London Bridge, Finsbury Park Mosque and Parsons Green Tube station on the anniversaries of the attacks. #LondonUnited is projected onto the Houses of ParliamentCredit: Mayor of London London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: \"Londoners will never forget the horrific terror attacks on our city in 2017. We will never forget the bravery of our emergency services and first responders who ran towards danger while urging the rest of us to run to safety. \"And we will never forget the courage of Pc Keith Palmer, who paid the ultimate sacrifice whilst protecting Parliament. \"These were not only attacks on our city and our country, but on the very heart of our democracy and the values we cherish most - freedom, justice and tolerance. \"We know that families, friends and communities have their own private arrangements in place to mark this tragic anniversary, and our plans here at City Hall are intended to complement, without intruding on, individual private commemorations. \"I hope these arrangements will help people to come together and remember those who were killed and injured, to show solidarity and support for their families and friends and the people whose lives have been affected by these tragic attacks. \"As we enter this period of remembrance and reflection, we stand together as Londoners, united against terrorism and in hope for the future.\" Five innocent people were killed in Masood's rampage - 48-year-old Pc Palmer, who was on duty at the Palace of Westminster, along with US tourist Kurt Cochran, Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, 31, and Britons Aysha Frade, 44, and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes, who were mown down on the bridge. The planned memorial was agreed following meetings with bereaved families, survivors, members of the emergency services and local councils. MPs hold minute's silence to remember victims Leader of Westminster City Council Nickie Aiken said she would join the Lord Mayor to lay flowers in Parliament Square on Thursday. She said: \"This week's anniversary will inevitably lead to feelings of huge sadness and loss for so many. But we will continue to stand together, united by what we have in common and not what separates us. \"That will be the true legacy of a senseless act of violence and murderous hate. It will only make the bonds that bind us all together even stronger.\" 'He wouldn't like any of the fuss': Pc Palmer's friend pays tribute to 'modest' officer A police officer has paid tribute to his friend and fellow officer who was killed in the Westminster attack. Pc Shaun Cartwright, who had been friends with Pc Keith Palmer for more than 10 years, said: \"Keith was a very modest man. \"He wouldn't like any of the fuss. He's just see whatever he was doing as just performing his job and doing it to the best of his ability.\" The pair had previously worked together on the on the Territorial Support Group and Pc Cartwright was due to be on shift after Pc Palmer at the gates on the day of the attack. Pc Keith Palmer with Staci Martin, an American tourist, 45 minutes before his death He told LBC radio: \"I was getting myself changed when the alarm went off, that there'd been a terrorist attack, there'd been a large explosion in the area of Portcullis House, Westminster Bridge, so I quickly pulled on all of my kit. \"It took me 30 seconds or so, run down towards the scene once I'd picked up my radio and battery and I went down to very close to the scene... I saw roughly what had happened. \"Obviously, we were unsure what was happening, whether it was going to be like a lone wolf attack or if it was a multi, marauding attack. That's the thing that most people were unsure about. We didn't know whether the person was acting alone or whether he was part of a bigger team.\" Video: Thousands attend Pc Keith Palmer's funeral He told LBC that getting back to work had been \"incredibly tough for an awful lot of people,\" especially for those that responded first of all, and that PC Palmer's family were \"coping as best they can, like people do in terrible circumstances\".","title":"Heroic MP Tobias Ellwood fights back tears on live TV as he relives describing Westminster atrocity to

{"originalUrl":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/13/russian-bot-behind-false-claim-muslim-woman-ignored-victims","text":"Follow the author of this article Follow the topics within this article It was the image that divided social media in the hours after the Westminster terror attack as a Muslim woman apparently walked past victims whilst looking at her phone. Now it can be revealed that one of the accounts which prompted the misleading image to go viral and fueled a racist backlash was actually a troll backed by the Russian Government. It is one of a series of tweets from 2016 and 2017 which show for the first time how a network of Kremlin-backed accounts posted a number of anti-immigration and pro-Brexit messages around the time of the referendum and in the wake of major terror attacks. In the case of the Westminster Bridge attack, the user @SouthLoneStar, who claimed to be a \"Proud TEXAN and AMERICAN patriot\", posted just one of a series of images of the women in a hijab with the message: \"Muslim woman pays no mind to the terror attack, casually walks by a dying man while checking phone #PrayForLondon #Westminster #BanIslam\". The account has now been identified by Twitter in evidence to the US congress as being backed by the Russians. The reaction that the tweet provoked at the time of the attack in March, in which five people were killed by Khalid Masood before he was shot dead by armed police, prompted the woman release a statement through Tell Mama, a group which monitors hate incidents against Muslims. \"I'm shocked and totally dismayed at how a picture of me is being circulated on social media,\" the unnamed woman said. \"To those individuals who have interpreted and commented on what my thoughts were in that horrific and distressful moment. The account Texas Lone Star has been identified by Twitter as being backed by the Russians \"I would like to say not only have I been devastated by witnessing the aftermath of a shocking and numbing terror attack, I've also had to deal with the shock of finding my picture plastered all over social media by those who could not look beyond my attire, who draw conclusions based on hate and xenophobia. \"My thoughts at that moment were one of sadness, fear, and concern. \"What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be of any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to the victims. \"I then decided to call my family to say that I was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. \"My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families.\" She also thanked photographer Jamie Lorriman, who had spoken out in her defence and pointed out that other photographs had shown she was visibly upset. It was not the only time that the user @SouthLoneStar meddled in British affairs and after the EU referendum vote the account, which had 16,826 followers, tweeted: \"I hope UK after #BrexitVote will start to clean their land from muslim invasion!\" and \"UK voted to leave future European Caliphate! #BrexitVote\". It was one of many accounts identified as Kremlin linked which were mainly focused on US politics but dabbled in wider issues in Europe. They have all been suspended by Twitter. \"There's this consistent and relentless focus on anti-immigrant sentiment, attacking Muslims in particular. [They are] making this sort of broad-brush, blanket link between Islam and terrorism,\" said Jonathon Morgan, CEO of New Knowledge, the security company which compiled the tweets. The news comes as MPs prepare to begin an inquiry into Russian interference in British politics to which both Twitter and Facebook have been asked to give evidence. Damian Collins, head of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee who is leading the inquiry, said that it showed Russian accounts were trying to \"influence political debate in the UK and also to insight hatred and turn communities against each other\". \"I think it shows that Russian-controlled accounts have been politically active in the UK as well as America,\" Mr Collins told Wired UK.

In 2004, the West audibly gasped when its preeminent scholar of Islam famously told the German newspaper Die Welt,“Europe will be Islamic by the end of the century,” if not sooner. Listen carefully. He did not say that Muslims will be the majority population in what is still recognizably Europe. No, Professor Lewis said “Europe will be Islamic.” We are not talking about Muslims here. We are talking about Islam. Lots of individual Muslims desire peaceful coexistence, even assimilation. But Islam’s aim is to prevail. So, yet again this week, Lewis’s foreboding has been brought to the fore by a jihadist mass-murder attack, this time in London. Advertisement As we go to press, five innocent people are dead after Khalid Masood, a terrorist acting on unambiguous scriptural commands to war against non-Muslims, rammed his rental Hyundai SUV into dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, many of them tourists taking in the iconic views of Parliament. About 50 people suffered injuries, some of them grave, so the death toll may yet rise. Masood, a burly 52-year-old weightlifter with a long criminal record that included vicious stabbings, then crashed the car through the gate at Westminster Palace, home of the West’s most venerable democratic legislature. He alighted brandishing two long knives, which he used to kill Keith Palmer, a police officer who, pursuant to British policy, was unarmed despite being assigned to provide security at one of the world’s foremost terror targets. Masood was finally shot dead by a protection officer attached to England’s defense minister. Advertisement There immediately began the ritual media pondering over Masood’s motive. Yes, what could it possibly have been? I’m going to stick with the patently obvious. Masood was born as Adrian Russell Ajao on Christmas Day, 1964, in Kent county, just outside London. His 17-year-old single mother remarried two years later, and he was known as Adrian Elms (his stepfather’s surname) until converting to Islam when he was about 40. Prior to that point, while fathering three children with his wife, he had several arrests, some for violent attacks. During at least one of the resulting stints in prison, like many inmates, he began indoctrination into Islam. Between 2004 and 2005 came the critical transition: the formal conversion, marriage to a Muslim woman, and relocation to Saudi Arabia (you know, be our “ally” against terrorism). For five years, Masood was immersed in the kingdom’s Wahhabism — fundamentalist Islam rooted in scriptural literalism. He became an English language-teacher working for the Saudi government. When we speak of Islam, as opposed to Muslims, we are not speaking about a mere religious belief system. We are talking about a competing civilization. Masood returned to England from Jeddah about seven years ago. By the time of Wednesday’s attack on Westminster Bridge, he had seamlessly gravitated to Birmingham, a city increasingly enveloped by sharia enclaves that, to varying degrees, have become “no-go zones” for non-Muslims and agents of the state, including police. Advertisement There is diversity in Islam, including millions of Muslims who adhere only to its spiritual elements or see themselves as more culturally than doctrinally Islamic. But when we speak of Islam, as opposed to Muslims, we are not speaking about a mere religious belief system. We are talking about a competing civilization — that is very much how Islam self-identifies. It has its own history, principles, values, mores, and legal system. Advertisement Islam, thus understood, is not non-Western. It is anti-Western. Like the conversion of Masood, the conversion of Birmingham has been a function of this defining Islamic attribute. Individual Muslims may assimilate, but Islam doesn’t do assimilation. Islam does not melt into your melting pot. Islam, as Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna proclaimed, is content with nothing less than political, cultural, and civilizational dominance. As Soeren Kern relates in a comprehensive Gatestone Institute report on Islam in Britain, the metamorphosis of Birmingham, along with several other U.K. population centers, signifies this resistance. When the Islamic presence in a Western community reaches a critical mass, Islam’s hostility to Western mores and demands for sharia governance result in non-Muslim flight. Marriages between Muslims resident in the Western community and Muslims overseas tend to result in childbirth rates and household growth that dwarfs that of the indigenous population. Arranged, intra-familial, and polygamous marriages, endorsed by Islamic mores, drastically alter the fabric of communities in short order. Birmingham, in particular, has been ground zero of “Operation Trojan Horse,” a sharia-supremacist scheme to Islamize the public schools. Kern repeats an account of life in “inner-city Birmingham” by the wife of a British clergyman, first published by Standpoint in 2011. She explained how the neighborhood in which she’d lived for four years had become a “police no-go zone,” in which the large number of newly arrived Somali immigrants now approached that of Pakistanis already resident. Then she recalled her husband’s encounter with an immigrant who had just arrived from Belgium — on an EU passport, like an increasing number of Muslims these days. The migrant was surprised when the clergyman asked why he had chosen to move into their neighborhood. Finally, he replied, “Everybody knows. Birmingham—best place in Europe to be pure Muslim.” Advertisement The memory moved the clergyman’s wife to a salient insight: Well, there must be many places in Europe where Muslims are entirely free to practice their faith, but I suspect there are few places in which they can have so little contact with the civic and legal structure of a Western state if they choose. To a London reader, born and bred with multiculturalism, I know that my stories may come across as outlandish and exaggerated. . . . When I recently told a friend how a large Taliban flag fluttered gaily on a house near St Andrew’s football stadium for some months, her cry of “Can’t you tell the police?” made me reflect how far many of our inner cities have been abandoned by our key workers: our doctors and nurses drive in from afar, the police, as mentioned before, have shut down their stations and never venture in unless in extremis — they and ambulance crews have been known to be attacked — even the local imam lives in a leafier area. Advertisement Advertisement It is in that milieu that Khalid Masood made his decision, rented an SUV, and drove to Westminster Bridge. Naturally, the Islamic State terror network (ISIS) took credit for the atrocity, as it has been wont to do since issuing its plea that Muslims conduct attacks “in place” — i.e., against the Western societies where they live. Western leaders have been content to accept these claims, at least as inspirational, if not operational. It is easier to indulge the fiction that ISIS catalyzes jihadism then to ask what catalyzed ISIS. But the remorseless fact is that before ISIS and al-Qaeda and the Khomeini revolution and Hezbollah and the Blind Sheikh and the Brotherhood and Khalid Masood, there was the single thing that unites them all. There was Islam. Western political and opinion elites remain willfully blind to this. They cannot help but project onto Islamic beliefs and practices their own progressive pieties — which take seriously neither religion nor the notion that there is any civilization but their own. In their minds, and therefore ingrained in the media’s coverage, is the notion that a Muslim community is just like any other community. Same with the mosque — it is just a “house of worship,” no different from a church, a safe harbor from worldly concerns and hostilities. Islam, however, does not separate mosque from state; the mosque is every bit as much a center for sharia indoctrination, assimilation resistance, and anti-Western politics as it is a prayer venue. That is why al-Banna regarded the mosque and the Islamic community center commonly attached to it as the “axis” of the “movement” in every community where Islam takes hold. The movement does not want cohabitation. It wants conquest. It starts with assimilation-resistant enclaves that nurture sharia supremacism today and thereby breed the jihadists of tomorrow. This week, it took the campaign to Westminster Bridge.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1003063/Parliament-crash-westminster-police-incident-car-gates","text":"THE driver of the car involved in today's Westminster “terror attack” outside the House of Parliament is \"not cooperating\" with police, according to the counter-terror officer leading the investigation. The 29-year-old man, a UK national and believed to be from the Midlands, was arrested by armed officers on suspicion of terror offences after a car mowed down pedestrians and cyclists before crashing into security barriers, installed to prevent terror attacks. Met Police confirmed they are treating the crash as a \"terrorist incident\". The Met Police have confirmed that counter-terrorism officers are carrying out searches at three addresses in the Midlands, which include two in Birmingham and one in Nottingham. Dozens of emergency vehicles swarmed the area and members of public were ordered to clear the area as as more than 200 police officers descended on the scene within minutes. They said the house is shared by six occupants and is home to six Sudanese people. Ibrahim Ahmed, 24, who lives in the same terrace row, said: \"It's Sudanese people who live there.\" Benas Butkevicius, who lives next door to the house that was raided, said: \"I was asleep when it happened. I just heard some banging and scratching. \"I work night shifts - at about 4pm I woke up to the scratching.\" An occupant of the house said: \"They thought the car was insured or registered here but it isn't. They were asking about a silver Fiesta. They said they were investigating what happened in Westminster.\" The Met Police says the suspect travelled from Birmingham to London late on Monday night and arrived in the London area just after midnight on Tuesday morning. The Ford Fiesta was in the Tottenham Court Road area from approximately 1:25am until 5:55am and then drove around Westminster and Whitehall from approximately 6:00am until the incident at 7:37am. Specialist officers from Project Servator, who are trained to recognise when a person is displaying minute signs of anxiety, have also been deployed in Westminster to identify anyone who may be in the area for terrorist or other criminal purposes. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the terror threat remains severe and that today's suspected attack in Westminster was \"shocking\". Parliament crash: A man was led away in handcuffs (Image: SKY NEWS ) Mrs May said: \"Today's suspected attack outside the Houses of Parliament is shocking. \"For the second time in as many years, the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door. \"The threat to the UK from terrorism remains severe. I would urge the public to remain vigilant - but also to come together and carry on as normal, just as they did after the sickening attacks in Manchester and London last year. \"The twisted aim of the extremists is to use violence and terror to divide us. They will never succeed.\" Chancellor Philip Hammond is the ranking minister in London at the moment but Mrs May is being kept informed while she is away in Switzerland on holiday, her spokesman said. Home Secretary Sajid Javid is returning to London from his own family break \"so that he can take a briefing in person on events\", the spokesman added. Security minister Ben Wallace has called for the public to be vigilant about odd behaviour and report it to police to help stop future terror attacks. The MP said:\"These type of attacks use cars, they use knives - everyday items to attack us when we're at our most vulnerable. \"In crowded spaces, when we're going about our normal jobs, going to work, and they do that because they know that that's where in our society - in a free and open society - we are vulnerable. \"We need to think about people behaving badly. If we see odd behaviour we need to report it to the police, we need to report it to the local authorities, report it to our community leaders.\" The MP for Wyre and Preston North added: \"It's also why we need to work with the private sector like car hire companies to say, 'Are you suspicious', 'Why is this person who's never driven an HGV hiring an HGV'.\" Officers cordoned off the whole square and members of the public were ordered to move back further as police put up a \"Terrorism Act cordon\", according to an officer at the scene. Parliament crash: Police have cordoned off the surrounding area (Image: BBC NEWS ) Jason Williams, 45, from Kennington, was walking to work when he saw the rush hour smash. He said: \"I saw a car going at high speed towards Parliament. It hit a bollard. It looked deliberate. It didn't look like an accident. How do you do that by accident? It was a loud bang.\" Mr Williams told how he saw \"10 people lying down\" following the incident outside the Houses of Parliament. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"He had driven it at speed - more than 40 mph. There was smoke coming out of the car. \"I have seen people on the ground, lying on the road. I don't know if they have actually been hit by the vehicle or not. I saw at least 10 people lying down. Parliament crash: A car has carried into security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament (Image: NC) He said: \"Straight away I thought 'Oh no, this is another terrorist attack' so I just started to run and the police were saying 'get out, get out of the area'.\" \"The car was behind me. I didn’t see anyone else involved. I just saw this one vehicle, so it seems to be deliberate.” Police vans were seen rushing through the City of London on their way to Westminster moments after the incident unfolded. Firearms officers and at least two police dogs were seen stationed inside Parliament Square. Another eyewitness Ewalina Ochab descrbed the moment she saw the incident unfold. She said: \"I think it looked intentional - the car drove at speed and towards the barriers.” Bus driver Victor Ogbomo, 49, was driving passengers past the front of Westminster when he saw the crash. He told the Press Association: ”All I saw was the smoke coming out of a vehicle, a silver vehicle. I just stopped the bus. Parliament crash: A number of pedestrians have been injured (Image: PA ) \"The police said we have to move back, then in less than five minutes the response team came. They went to the vehicle, so we had to push back. I saw the car in the barrier, I didn't know how it got there. \"I think someone was inside the vehicle because many police went towards the vehicle.\" He said officers had their guns out when they arrested the driver. Mr Ogbomo added: ”I was walking on the other side of the road. I heard some noise and someone screamed. I turned around and I saw a silver car driving very fast close to the railings, maybe even on the pavement.\" MPs have also reacted to the terror attack, which took place during parliament recess for summer. On arrival at Parliament, Boris Johnson said: \"If it is indeed confirmed to be a terror incident, then it's very sad and very troubling indeed. \"Hopefully people will be able to go about their normal days as soon as possible.\" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"Huge thanks to our emergency services for their rapid reaction to incident in Westminster this morning. My thoughts are with those injured.\" Parliament crash: Armed police are on the scene in Westminster (Image: PA ) Roger Godsiff, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green, has tweeted: \"Today's attack at Westminster was carried out by an individual who is believed to have been living in my constituency in Birmingham. \"My deepest sympathies to the cyclists and pedestrians who were injured in the attack. \"I have told the police and security services that they have my total support in doing whatever is necessary to protect the public in London and Birmingham.\" David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said: “Awful news from Westminster. My thoughts are with all those injured. Thanks for a quick response from @metpoliceuk, Parliament security and the London Ambulance Service.” Parliament crash: Sniffer dogs are also involved in the investigation (Image: PA ) Neil O’Brien Tory MP for Harborough said: “Awful news - thoughts very much with those currently receiving medical treatment, and everyone else affected by this. \"Please remain vigilant if working in/visiting Westminster today.” Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, tweeted: \"Our thoughts are with those who have been injured in the incident outside the Houses of Parliament this morning, and our thanks go out to the quick and effective response of our police and medical services. \"Thank goodness the barriers are in place and worked.\" Parliament crash: Most of Westminster and large parts of central London to be closed this morning. (Image: PA ) Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: \"My thoughts are with those hurt and injured outside Parliament this morning in what is being treated as a terrorist incident. \"Our thanks go to our emergency services who responded immediately. Their bravery keeps us safe day in, day out.\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is in \"close contact\" with the Police Crime Commissioner. He tweeted: \"I’m in close contact with @MetPoliceUK Commissioner about the incident at Parliament Square this morning. Thank you to the first responders who were on the scene so quickly. Enquiries are continuing. Westminster tube station is currently closed. The Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Speaker offered their sympathies to those injured this morning outside Parliament. They said: \"We would like to offer our thoughts and sympathies to those who were injured or affected by the incident. Parliament crash: Firefighters are on the scene at Westminster (Image: REUTERS ) Our heartfelt thanks go to the emergency services who responded so quickly and to those who work every day to keep all of us who work in Parliament safe.\" The Houses of Parliament are surrounded with security barriers of steel and concrete. The measures were extended in the wake of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017 when Khalid Masood ploughed a car into crowds on Westminster Bridge, killing five people, inlcuding a police officer. Khalid Masood ploughed a 4X4 into crowds before he was shot outside Parliament, injuring 50 people. Masood abandoned his car then stabbed and killed unarmed PC Keith Palmer before he was shot by armed police in a courtyard outside Parliament. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that since March 2017 13 Islamist plots and four far-right plots have been successfully foiled. There were 676 live investigations being carried out by the security services and counter-terror police at the end of June, up from more than 500 in March, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. There are roughly 3,000 active \"subjects of interest\" at any one time - while there is also a wider pool of more than 20,000 individuals who have previously featured in probes whose threat must be kept under review. Earlier this year, the Government unveiled a refreshed counter-terror strategy. Under the blueprint, MI5 intelligence will be shared with bodies outside the security community in an attempt to stop suspects before attack plots can crystallise, while anti-terror laws are to be strengthened to allow earlier interventions. Scotland Yard is appealing to witnesses for information on Tuesday's crash to call 0800 789 321.","title":"Parliament TERROR ATTACK: Driver 'not cooperating' as police search properties across UK | UK

{"originalUrl":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/westminster-attack-khalid-masood-took-steroids-terrorist-london-parliament-isis-inquest-latest-a8159926.html","text":"The terrorist who killed five people in the Westminster attack had taken steroids before launching the frenzied rampage, a court has heard. The possible effect of steroid use on Khalid Masood will be considered alongside a “psychological autopsy” during the inquest into his death. It will examine whether he was radicalised in prison, the extent of his contact with Anjem Choudary’s al-Muhajiroun network and what the security services learned during an MI5 investigation that declared Masood a “subject of interest” in 2009. The inquest, where Masood’s widow is among interested parties, will piece together his preparations including obtaining the knives and car used in the attack and consider “whether his activities gave any warning signs”. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, the Chief Coroner of England and Wales, ruled that the inquest will be held before a jury, as required for all deaths involving contact with police. Specialist witnesses will be called to hearings at the Old Bailey to reconstruct the events of 22 March and Masood’s preparations, including body armour experts charged with examining PC Palmer’s “inadequate” protection. Judge Lucraft expressed his condolences to their families and the hope that answering their many questions could “provide some comfort”. “The inquest can point everyone in the right direction to do more to address these problems... which occur again and again in trial after trial,” Mr Patterson said. “We do not understand why radicalising material remains freely available on the internet. “We do not understand why it’s necessary for WhatsApp, Telegram and other applications to have end-to-end encryption.” Mr Patterson also questioned how Masood managed to get through the gates surrounding the Houses of Parliament and “how it was PC Palmer was apparently stationed alone and unarmed with, it seems, inadequate body protection”. Masood, 52, was born in Kent as Adrian Russell and was known to police after seven convictions for violent crime leading up to 2003, when he may have converted to Islam during his last spell in prison.

Masood’s case was closed in 2012 following a security review, appearing intermittently as contact of subject in Choudary’s network before starting preparations for his attack in 2016. From the end of that year, he told his family he was considering working overseas, but his job and visa applications failed. Masood bought the knives used in the attack on 9 March, sending himself an email with the subject line “Retaliation” on the same day. Six days later, he created a document entitled “Jihad in the Quran and Sunnah”, with his photograph on the front page and multiple extracts from the Quran that could be seen as supportive of jihad and martyrdom. He collected the Hyundai Tucson on 16 March, conducted reconnaissance of Westminster Bridge three days later and browsed YouTube for videos relating to terrorism and suicide attacks. Minutes before launching the attack, Masood shared his document with numerous WhatsApp contacts, which was soon sent onwards via iMessage and SMS A review of the intelligence gathered in the run-up to the Westminster, Manchester, London Bridge and Finsbury Park attacks found that Masood had not been re-considered as a potential threat by MI5. “No intelligence was being gathered on him and neither MI5 nor the police had any reason the anticipate the attack,” said David Anderson QC. “You’re looking at someone who is such a long way from the top of anyone’s grid that frankly, it’s a bit difficult

PC Palmer, who had served on the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Group since April 2016, was confronted by an attacker - armed with knives - who just moments before had been responsible for the murder of several members of the public on Westminster Bridge. \"Keith acted that day with no thought for his own safety, intent simply on doing his job and protecting members of the public and Parliament. He paid the ultimate price for his selfless actions. We continue to grieve the loss of a much-loved and respected colleague and friend while supporting his family through this truly difficult time.\" – Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Keith had been in the Metropolitan Police Service for 16 years. Prior to joining the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Group he was a member of the Territorial Support Group, based at Catford but patrolling and working across London.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29784493","text":"The prime minister was in Leeds to launch government plans to upgrade rail links in the north of England. A member of Mr Cameron's security team intervened as a man appeared to dart towards the prime minister. Officers then bundled the man away as the prime minister got into a waiting vehicle. 'Funny side' Mr Farley later revealed himself to be the man at the centre of the incident, saying he was not a protester and was totally unaware the prime minister was visiting the city. \"I didn't see David Cameron. I didn't know it was David Cameron until they let me out of the police van an hour later,\" Mr Farley, who was eventually released without charge, said. The 28-year old said he was on the way to his local gym for a session with his personal trainer when he crossed the road outside the council building. \"All I saw were a group of men in suits who came out of the Civic Hall.\" He added: \"It begs the question - how good is Cameron's security if I managed to run between it before they stopped me?\" Mr Farley, who was carrying a towel but no ID at the time, said it had been \"harrowing\" to find himself \"harangued and manhandled\" by police and not being told why he had been arrested. \"I'm quite shook up. I was almost in shock, like I'd been in an accident or something.\" The media reaction to the incident had been \"insane\", he said, adding that many of his friends wanted to buy him a drink and he could see the \"funny side\". \"I kind of wish I had been protesting something or I had had something to say\", he added. 'No threats' Following the incident, Chief Inspector Derek Hughes of West Yorkshire Police said: ''Around midday, a 28-year-old local man was briefly arrested after he came close to the prime minister's group who had just left the Civic Hall in Leeds. ''No threats were made, and after the man's details were checked, he was de-arrested and allowed on his way.'' The BBC's Tom Symonds said a member of Mr Cameron's party told him the prime minister stepped back as the man ran towards him and was not in contact with him. The prime minister's close security is generally provided by officers from SO1 Specialist Protection, part of the Metropolitan Police's Protection Command. Labour MP Keith Vaz said he would be \"astonished\" if there was not a review of procedures. \"It could have ended in a completely different scenario,\" he told Sky News, adding that Mr Farley's actions had caused a \"great deal of concern\". 'Prescott punch' But former Met officer Peter Power said that although \"questions would be asked\" about the incident, it was \"not catastrophic\" and was unlikely to lead to major changes. He told BBC News that the fact that the man had been taken away so quickly showed the police response \"worked reasonably well\". Image caption Dean Farley, running, heads towards the PM, third from left Image caption A security man grapples with the Mr Farley as he collides with the PM But former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott, who punched a protester during the 2001 general election campaign after being hit by an egg, said the episode proved that security around top politicians needed to be \"tightened up\". And speaking during a parliamentary statement on last week's EU summit, Mr Cameron jokingly made reference to the so-called \"Prescott punch\". \"I was actually in a meeting in Leeds speaking to a group of city leaders and other politicians and John Prescott was in the room as I gave the speech,\" he told MPs. \"And as I left the room I thought the moment of maximum danger had probably passed but clearly that wasn't the case.\" Mr Cameron said he wanted to put on record the \"debt\" he owed to those who protect him on a daily basis, saying they did a \"very good job\". It comes less than a week after a man threw a bag of marbles at the glass screen which separates the public from MPs in the House of Commons.","title":"Jogger in PM security alert had 'no idea' what

Attacker Khalid Masood, 52, killed four pedestrians and injured about 50 others as he mowed down members of the public with a car on Westminster Bridge at about 2:40pm on Wednesday. He then crashed his hired Hyundai SUV into the railings in front of Parliament Yard before bursting through the gate to the Palace of Westminster with two large knives where he fatally stabbed unarmed Pc Keith Palmer, 48. The attack sent Westminster into lockdown and MPs were forced to stay put in the House of Commons for more than four hours while the area was made safe. Prime Minister Theresa May had just voted and was standing in members' lobby with other Tory MPs. She was seen being quickly ushered into a silver Jaguar in the grounds of the Palace of Westminster and whisked away to the safety of Downing Street. Pc Palmer and Masood also died despite attempts by paramedics to save them both. PC Keith Palmer, 48, died in the attack. Aysha Frade with husband John Frade Westminster attack victim Kurt Cochran . At least 50 people of 12 different nationalities were injured, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, two Greeks, and one each from Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and the United States. One of the injured has life-threatening injuries and two others are in a critical condition. Three police officers were also hurt, two of whom remained in hospital in Friday with \"significant injuries\". Who was the attacker? Burly body-building enthusiast Khalid Masood, 52, was born in Dartford in Kent on Christmas Day 1964. His mother Janet Ajao gave birth when she was just 17 years old and brought him up as Adrian Russell Ajao. The married father-of-three spent years moving round the country - and the prison system - with a host of different identities, including Adrian Elms.

He died after life support was withdrawn at King's College Hospital on Thursday night. His family is receiving support from specially-trained liaison officers, Scotland Yard said. Other victims have been named as Pc Keith Palmer, Kurt Cochran and Aysha Frade. Kurt Cochran, a US tourist from Utah celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary. His wife Melissa was badly injured. They were visiting her parents, who are working as Mormon missionaries in London. Aysha Frade, was a 'highly regarded and loved' member of college staff. She worked in administration at independent sixth-form school DLD College London, in Westminster, is understood to have been 43 and married with two daughters. The attacker has now been named as British born Khalid Masood. The Kent-born 'lone-wolf' attacker, who was living in the Birmingham area, has a series of convictions for assault and other crimes but police insist there was no intelligence suggesting he was about to unleash a terror attack. The Islamic State has claimed the killer was one of its 'soldiers'. Reports said he was a married English teacher and a religious convert who was into bodybuilding. It is believed he lived in the Winson Green area of Birmingham, where neighbours claimed he lived with a woman and a young child. Neighbours said he was 'well spoken'. Theresa May has visited victims and staff at hospital yesterday, it was a private visit and she spent 40 minutes there. Forty people were injured in the attack, with 29 treated in hospital. Five people remained in a critical condition on Thursday evening, two with life-threatening injuries. The casualties included 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, two Greeks, and one each from Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and the United States. A minute's silence was held nationwide on Thursday and crowds later gathered in Trafalgar Square for a candlelit vigil. A Just Giving page for Pc Keith Palmer's family set up by the Metropolitan Police Federation reached it's £250,000 target, just ten hours after it was launched. It was already above £358,000 last night.
