He had been on life support since the attack. He has not been named. The three others killed have been identified as PC Keith Palmer, who was stabbed outside parliament; and Aysha Frade and Kurt Cochran, who died on Westminster bridge. Four people remain in hospital in a serious condition, one with life-threatening injuries. Westminster attack: friends and relatives remember the victims Read more The attacker Police have said that Khalid Masood was born in Kent on Christmas day 1964, and that this was not his birth name. Multiple reports now say he was born as Adrian Elms and converted to Islam. This name has not been confirmed. He had a number of convictions – for assaults, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences – spanning 20 years, and had spent time in jail, though not for terrorist-related offences. Masood was previously known to MI5 was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism, but was considered “a peripheral figure”, prime minister Theresa May said. The Sun reports today that Masood spent the night before the attack at the Preston Park hotel in Brighton. The Guardian has not been able to verify this. Westminster attacker named by police as Khalid Masood Read more The arrested Eight people were arrested as a number of addresses were raided in London, Birmingham and elsewhere: A 39-year-old woman at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man at an address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27 and 26 at a separate address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 58-year-old man at a separate address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Intelligence services are working hard to put together the whole picture, but I would caution drawing conclusions yet. I would wait and see what comes forward from the intelligence that’s going on now. Rudd said it “seems likely” Masood was radicalised online: We know there’s an onslaught of radicalisation online, there’s so much information that tries to go out as propaganda to persuade people to take this sort of action. The man who photographed a Muslim woman walking past a victim of the Westminster terrorist attack has defended her and said the image has been “misappropriated”. The photograph – showing a woman holding her phone as a group of people gathered around someone injured in the attack on Westminster bridge – was criticised by some on social media as alleged evidence of her lack of concern. As investigators piece together the background of Khalid Masood, reports are emerging about his past. Police have said that Masood was born in Kent on Christmas day 1964, and that this was not his birth name. Multiple reports now say he was born – and lived till at least 2003 – as Adrian Elms. Police have not commented on that, but according to the Press Association, a spokesman said he was known by a number of different names and research into them was continuing. As well as Kent, he was believed to have lived for some time in the West Midlands, where police raids took place after the attack in London. The Sun reports today that Masood spent the night before the attack at the Preston Park hotel in Brighton. The Guardian has not been able to verify this, and Press Association says it was told by staff there that they had been “instructed not to talk”. Theresa May said the right things this week, writes Martin Kettle. But will she put them into practice? This consensual approach was the right course. It also allowed her to get some politically difficult information out into the public domain early and without provoking any blowback. May’s statement contained a disturbing admission, one familiar from the 7/7 events and from Woolwich, and which could yet become a stick to beat her with. Khalid Masood had been known to the authorities. He had come to MI5’s attention in the past. But he was off the radar in the run-up to his act of terror. There was no prior intelligence of his readiness to act. When attacks like this happen people rally round. The popular wisdom is difficult to mistake in London this week. Britain’s wartime self-image as the nation that could take it, that was not afraid, could keep calm and carry on or, this week, go on drinking tea came effortlessly to the fore. Newspapers that are too puffed up with their own importance, especially post-Brexit, got it badly wrong by trying to be divisive or demanding unspecified tough action. A politician who pretended to be Winston Churchill would get it wrong too. Read the full column here: Theresa May talks the talk on British values, but that’s not enough | Martin Kettle She was plucked to safety when the crew on a passing boat saw her floating downstream. Staff on the Milennium Diamond used a boat hook to grab her clothing. She was then picked up by a rescue boat and treated by paramedics. Andreea Cristea. Photograph: Facebook Kyle Haughton, managing director at the firm, said: “City Cruises’ Millennium Diamond was in the area of the incident at the time and worked alongside London’s emergency services to support in the rescue efforts of a woman in the water. “Once alerted by people on the bridge, the ship’s captain reacted fast on spotting her. He halted the boat in order to hold her out of the water and stop her from being carried any further by the current. The emergency services were called immediately and arrived within minutes to take over the rescue operation.” Khalid Masood was a violent criminal convicted of multiple offences spanning 20 years, Robert Booth and Nazia Parveen report: His offences included assaults, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. He had spent time in jail but not for terrorist-related offences, according to Amber Rudd, the home secretary. The 52-year-old’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife, said the Metropolitan police. It also emerged that Masood had been previously known to MI5 although the prime minister said he had been considered “a peripheral figure” in relation to suspected Islamist terror threats. He was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism, said Theresa May. Downing Street declined to say whether that was between 2010 and 2016 during May’s time as home secretary. A spokesperson repeated her position that Masood came across the radar of the security services “some years ago”. Since then, there had been no intelligence to suggest his intent to mount a terrorist attack. The news that the London attacker was born in Britain and inspired by extremist Islamist ideology was entirely predictable, as was his criminal record. The standout detail from the sketchy profile we have of Khalid Masood is his age: 52, nearly twice that of most contemporary attackers. The significance of Masood’s age will later become clear. For the moment it simply underlines the variety of extremist profiles, and the unpredictability of the threat. Most Islamic militants have been between the ages of 18 and 35, with the average age declining in recent years. Some analysts see their attraction to radicalism as partly a generational rebellion. Violent rightwing militants tend to be much older. Thomas Mair, who killed MP Jo Cox last year, was 52. Every case is, of course, unique. And the reality is that, much as all politics is essentially local, so is terrorism. Islamic extremist strategists have wrestled with this challenge to their global vision for years, and have yet to evolve an adequate response. Western experts argue interminably over whether the motives of individuals are 10% ideology and 90% local context or vice versa. But the sad reality is that, though it may be reassuring to blame bad guys, or bad ideas, from a long way away for violence at home, no one should be surprised that the man who attacked one of Britain’s most symbolically charged locations was born in the UK. No surprise that London attacker was born in UK | Jason Burke The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has suggested the country’s controversial far-right politician Pauline Hanson is playing into the hands of Islamist terrorists, after she used the London attack as an opportunity to push for a Muslim ban, AAP reports. The One Nation leader tweeted after the attack, calling for people to pray for a ban on Muslims in Australia. “The object of the Islamist terrorist is to get the broader society to turn on Muslims at large,” Turnbull told Melbourne radio. Turnbull said he had already made that position clear to Senator Hanson, adding: If you seek to attribute to all Australian Muslims responsibility for the crimes of Isil [Islamic State] then you are doing what Isil wants. Four of the five South Koreans who were injured in the attack have been released from hospital. They are all aged in their 50s and 60s. The Korea Herald reports that the four who have been released from hospital – three women and a man – suffered injuries such as broken bones when they were caught in the rush following the attack. They are likely to return to South Korea today, the Korea JoongAng Daily reports. A 67-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a head injury was “awaiting progress after the operation”, South Korean foreign ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck told reporters at a news briefing. “We will provide all necessary assistance to the injured citizens and their families until they come home safely,” he said. The South Korean government yesterday issued a statement saying it “strongly condemns the barbarian attack on civilians” and would actively participate in the global fight against terrorism.","title":"Westminster attack: 75-year-old man becomes fourth victim – as it happened | UK news | The

A disconnect between brain and feeling. So it took me the best part of an hour to make sense of what I had seen. But the simple truth is this. Today I saw a man die. A police officer, someone I had almost certainly said “hello” to at some point over the years. Possibly even this morning. Who knows? It was about 2.50pm when a reporter from Bloomberg came running into the Guardian office in the House of Commons to say there had been an incident outside. I ran into the offices of the Daily Telegraph that overlook New Palace Yard to see two bodies lying near the entrance to Westminster Hall, just yards from where Airey Neave had been murdered nearly 40 years previously. I asked what had happened. “Some bloke just attacked a policeman with a knife,” I was told. “And then another policeman shot him three times in the chest.” Westminster attack: four confirmed dead including police officer and attacker - live Read more Armed police officers ran to the scene. Some started tending to the bodies; others stood around. Another man came running out. I didn’t recognise him. None of us did, we must have all been in shock. It later turned out he was Tobias Ellwood, a junior foreign minister whom we had all seen countless times before. Time stretched out as people began to do CPR on both bodies. Then after what felt like an age later, but can only have been a matter of minutes, there was the noise overhead of the air ambulance preparing to land in Parliament Square. Several armed police officers ran from New Palace Yard to talk to three paramedics dressed in yellow. They bypassed the first body – the assailant – and went straight to work on the fallen policeman. The scene became more ordered, yet more urgent. They worked for several minutes, hoping for a miracle that never came. At some point one of the medics must have decided they had done all they could and they agreed to stop. They went to help those attending to the man who had been shot. Lines were put into him and further CPR administered. The man was taken away in an ambulance. A short while later the air ambulance took off, leaving only the dead policeman inside the parliamentary estate. His body was wrapped in a white bag on the cobbles where he had fallen. I went back to my desk, unsure of what to do. I had come to work that day expecting to sketch prime minister’s questions and had ended up as one of many witnesses to a terrorist attack. At various points in the afternoon, with the whole of the Houses of Parliament locked down, I returned to the window to see what was going on. It was as if I was somehow hoping that I could rewind time, that I could make what had happened unhappen.","title":"The numbing afternoon when I saw a police officer die outside parliament | John

{"originalUrl":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/02/people-westminster-have-no-clue-about-concept-friendship","text":"People in Westminster have no clue about the concept of friendship Sign Up Get the New Statesman's Morning Call email. For months, I’ve been scratching my head over last summer’s outrage at the idea a Labour MP would refuse to befriend their Tory colleagues. I was genuinely shocked by the volcanic reaction to that simple concept: that you’d be expected to sup with the people who are actively hurting your community, your friends, your family. It seemed pure common sense, so at first I thought it was faux outrage. Now I realise that it is part of a deep dysfunction. Since working in Westminster (for Laura Pidcock, the MP who initiated this debate) and viewing it from an anthropological perspective, I’ve realised it is a case of two distinct, common senses colliding, and it needs unpicking. It’s not Laura’s remarks they don’t understand, but the entire meaning of friendship. So, let’s start from the beginning. We know that, until recently, the route into politics, on both sides, was fairly standard, a well-trodden path: a disproportionate number of MPs came from public schools, or elite universities, especially Oxbridge. Not all, of course – there were other routes, (eg. through trade unions or as “self-made” business people). But certainly among those who “made it” to higher office, there was a very specific culture. Anyone who has spent any time with those who have been incubated in those “elite” schools and universities know that alongside a very prominent sense of entitlement, there is also a culture of competition, a slightly dysfunctional concept of friendship, and a deep sense of loneliness. Parliament, in many senses, is a mirror of that bizarre culture, with all those facets of competition, unstable alliances, and loneliness. Spend a week in Parliament and you will feel the alienation – it’s tangible. Imagine then, that you’re a young, northern, working-class woman, who went to a comp and Manchester Metropolitan Uni, with very different values. To anyone from the culture and history that most of us inhabit, the atmosphere of Parliament – not just the tradition, rules or the building, but the transient human relationships, the proximity of gossiping journalists in almost all parts of Westminster and the enclosed, privileged spaces – is absolutely alienating, if not hostile. As Laura said, it’s the strangest workplace anyone of us has ever inhabited. To find it normal in any sense, you must have emerged from a very different reality. That different reality is the privileged bubble of the elite, as educated inside the cloisters of Oxbridge colleges and comfortingly expensive private schools. Of course, people say: “But Tony Benn was great friends with Enoch Powell.” And it’s true that he did spend time in the House with the old racist, as he did with Ian Paisley. Reading the diaries, there is no evidence that their friendship extended much beyond Westminster. I doubt Caroline would have allowed it. Benn did, however, attend Powell’s funeral and allegedly told worried New Labour spin doctors that he would be going because Powell was “his friend”. I didn’t know him well enough to quiz him on that concept of friendship and what it meant to him, but I do remember him talking about Powell in similar terms to Thatcher: that he hated his ideology, but respected the fact that he was, in his terms, a signpost rather than a weathervane and he admired that. Is that friendship? Is that as deep as the friendship he had with Dennis Skinner, Joan Maynard or Eric Heffer? I suppose we can only guess, but my own view is that, because he was from a privileged and politically pluralist background, Benn had learned the parliamentary game. That doesn’t mean that he and Powell were the greatest of friends, only that in the lonely rooms of the Palace of Westminster, they shared some common personal ground, just as Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill did. In among the feather-spitting, one small sentence of Laura Pidcock’s has been completely missed, but it offers a clue to the real issue here. She said: “I have friends I choose to spend time with.” That isn’t a deliberate, provocative dismissal of the people she is now surrounded by in Parliament, but a genuine sentiment, and those of us who aren’t career politicians will recognise it as such. Friends aren’t people who we share chit-chat with on the Terrace or in the Strangers’ Bar. They aren’t a journalist who we “hit it off” with over a coffee in Portcullis House, someone we exchange jokes with about how bad Arsenal were at the weekend – and definitely not someone we say “hi” to as we pass them in the corridor between votes. It isn’t even someone we find common cause with, or chat over an issue with (whatever party). None of that is friendship, at least not the way we conceive it. Close friends are people who you share your home with, your darkest secrets and most fanciful ideas. They are people who’ve seen you through weddings, break-ups, who’ve seen you be sick, who’ve laughed at your disasters and frailties. People you’ve cried with, who understand your very soul, despite the jokes that might permeate that bond. To many of us, friendships are permanent, binding contracts. If we want to talk about unconditional friendships, that’s where politics don’t matter. Values do, but not formal politics. I have friends who don’t share my politics, but I love them dearly. For people to confuse that and the kind of relationships we are offered in Parliament is absolutely bizarre. They aren’t the same thing. New Labour MPs, whether new or not, whether young or old, would slot into the expected culture a lot easier than those who come from the outside in, as it were. If the 2015 Labour intake included many people from outside the political bubble, then the 2017 intake took it one stage further. One of the most incredible consequences of the unexpectedly good result in June 2017 was the entry of a new generation of MPs, which almost accidently ended up being exactly what the Labour Party needed: MPs like Marsha de Cordova, Laura Smith and Ruth George, who are a huge breath of fresh air. Obviously, we should all expect political capital to be made out of any sense that the mould is being broken. There are many people in that place with a real interest in preserving the status quo. So the zealous right-wing press, licking its lips, helped by a strengthened hard right on the Tory benches, has attempted to portray this quiet revolution, this slow gathering of MPs who are truly representative of the population at large rather than a political establishment, as something sinister. Irony died when the Express bemoaned the “politics of hate” seeping into Westminster. You’ve got to admire the chutzpah, if nothing else. The purveyors of hate almost betraying their fear in the process. The media is central to this, because it’s as much a part of this dysfunctional culture as the politicians themselves. Journalists hang around the cafés and bars like charming, ingratiating hyenas. And they have a deep interest in perpetuating these paper-thin, fake friendships of convenience. So, in some ways, this has been nothing more than a terrible miscommunication. What they are really asking working-class MPs elected over the last three years isn’t: “Are you going to be friends with Tories?” Literally, who cares about that? No, the real question behind it is: “Are you going to conform?”. “Are you going to bow down to the status quo? To the power of the media and the mush of centrism?” And the answer to that, I’m pleased to say, is a firm “No”.

As is often the case, misinformation began circulating quickly after the attack. 1. Britain's Channel 4 reported that a man named Abu Izzadeen is the suspect in the attack, but he was jailed a year ago. Sources confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Izzadeen is still in prison. The network has since retracted its claim. 3. One tweet of a screenshot from Al Jazeera's live Facebook coverage said \"the Muslim world\" is laughing at the London attack. It's difficult to know whether the screenshot is real, but it is possible to see all the reactions a video got on Facebook. Al Jazeera's video shows a very small minority of viewers \"laughed\" at the video. Facebook / Al Jazeera English Because it's possible to keep clicking the reaction button to flood the screen with emojis, there's no way of knowing whether one person reacted or 80.

An interview with Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, in which he said terrorist attacks are \"part and parcel\" of life in big cities, has been taken out of context. The interview was published in September 2016.

In what has become a recurring hoax, comedian Sam Hyde has once again been falsely called the suspect.","title":"Here's The Misinformation Spreading About The London

The dead officer was named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father. PM Theresa May said the attack on Wednesday was \"sick and depraved\" and struck at values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech. The attacker has not been named. Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said they think they know who he is and that he was inspired by international and Islamist-related terrorism, but gave no further details. The attack unfolded at about 14.40 GMT on Wednesday when a single attacker drove a grey Hyundai i40 along a pavement over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament in central London, killing three people and injuring many more. The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament. The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed. The attacker was shot dead by armed officers. Mr Rowley paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen.\" Image copyrightMetropolitan PoliceImage caption Keith Palmer had 15 years service with the police \"Heartbroken\" former colleague, Conservative MP James Cleverly, paid tribute to the \"lovely man\" he had known for 25 years. The pair had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer became a policeman. Mrs May said the attack was a \"sick and depraved\" attack on the heart of the capital. Such attempts to defeat UK values were \"doomed to failure\", she said. She paid tribute to the \"exceptional men and women\" of the police force who responded to the attack, saying: \"We will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart.\" The prime minister added: \"The location of this attack was no accident. \"The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.\" She is expected to make a statement in the Commons later.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: \"My message to those that want to harm us and destroy our way of life is: You won't succeed; you won't divide us; we won't be cowed by terrorists.\" BBC Newsnight reported there was a suggestion the car used in the attack was hired from an address in Birmingham. However, this has not been confirmed. Armed police carried out a raid on an address in Hagley Road in the city on Wednesday night. A witness told the Press Association: \"They came and arrested three men.\" The BBC understands the Birmingham raid is linked to the London attack. West Midlands Police referred inquires about the operation to Scotland Yard. In latest developments: There will be more armed and unarmed officers on duty in London and across the country as a \"precautionary measure\" The prime minister said the UK terror threat level would remain at severe - its second highest - meaning an attack is \"highly likely\" Home Secretary Amber Rudd urged everyone to remain calm but be vigilant and if they see anything they are concerned about report it to the police People worried about family and friends can call the police casualty bureau on: 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010.

Terrorism looks not just to kill and maim - but to create panic and such a sense of disorder that it rocks a city or nation to its foundations. And this attacker sought to do so in as low-tech way as is possible. The days when terrorism meant large, complex bombs and months of planning are gone: Western security agencies - particularly MI5 and its partner agencies - are very, very good at identifying those plots and disrupting them. The longer it takes to plan such an attack, the more people who are involved, the more chances there will be for security services to learn what is going on.

He returned to the UK in November 2016 with “murderous intentions”, set on police officers, military personnel or MPs in a deadly knife attack in central London, the Old Bailey heard. Ali, who had been under surveillance since re-entering the country, was stopped by armed police in Whitehall on April 27 last year, as he marched towards Downing Street and Parliament armed with three knives. His fingerprints had been linked by the FBI to Taleban bomb components in Afghanistan, and during his police interview Ali confessed he had helped to construct around 300 explosive devices. At trial, Ali claimed he had been kidnapped in Pakistan and forced to build the bombs, and he insisted that he was not planning a terrorist attack when he was arrested in Whitehall. Arrest: the moment Khalid Ali was tackled to the ground in Whitehall (PA) But a jury today convicted him of plotting a terrorist atrocity and two explosives charges. \"If he hadn't had been stopped, who knows how many more people would be lying dead or mortally wounded on the streets of Westminster,' said Brian Altman QC, prosecuting. \"That was to be his message; a killing in the heart of Westminster, a spectacular, making headline news around the world.\" The Met’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, who is in charge of the UK’s counter terrorism policing, said British authorities had kept a close watch on Ali since his return to the UK but had been unable to arrest him on bomb charges despite the fingerprint match. He said the Met was “pushing its allies and international partners hard” to get the evidence they needed to charge him, but were hampered by lengthy “due process” between authorities in the US and Afghanistan. The fingerprint match was finally sent to the UK within hours of Ali’s arrest in Whitehall, when it was clear he was facing an allegation of plotting a home-grown terror attack. “Quite clearly he had come back her with murderous intentions”, said Mr Haydon. “He is an incredible dangerous individual and was determined to kill police officers, military, or Parliamentarians here in the UK.” Ali’s mother had called the police the day before his arrest, concerned after she found four knives in his bedroom at the family home in Edmonton, north London. Firearms officers making the arrest in Whitehall (Getty) The following day, he was tracked as he went to Wilko in Ealing to replenish his knife collection, putting two blades in each pocket and another stuffed into the waistband of his trousers. He had already conducted reconnaissance on potential targets, including the MI6 building, New Scotland Yard, the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Bridge, and Downing Street, in the month before his arrest, stopping to excitedly quiz police officers about their work and the local area. He was stopped by armed officers in Whitehall, and in interview talked of his time with the Taleban – though claimed he had been acting under duress. He described himself as a “Mujahid” – a soldier of Islam – and admitted working on around 300 Al Qaeda bombs, adding menacingly: “If you thought the atom bomb was bad I don't think that's nothing compared to what's coming.” “I have to defend my fellow Muslim brothers and sisters”, he told officers. Weapons stash: Knives found on Khalid Ali after his arrest (PA) “There is a lot that is out there that you guys don't know about. In order to get this message across I came back in person. To let you know, those who are running the country, to give them that message. “Leave the Muslim lands, just leave them.” Ali had told his family he was going on a plumbing job in Birmingham when he left the country in 2011, only returning to the UK to bring “violent global Jihad to this country”, said prosecutor Brian Altman QC. Ali denied but was convicted of preparation of terrorist acts and two counts of possessing explosive substances with intent. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC, the Recorder of London, will now decide when to sentence Ali.","title":"Taliban bomb-maker Khalid Ali guilty of plotting knife attack in Westminster | London Evening

May also travelled to Buckingham Palace last night, at about 6pm, to hold her usual audience with the Queen, the spokesman confirmed. He said May had signed the condolence book for the victims of the attacks and had received calls from a series of world leaders since the attack, including the French president, François Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Donald Trump. Keith Palmer's family pay tribute to 'brave and courageous' officer The family of PC Keith Palmer have released a statement through the Met police: Keith will be remembered as a wonderful dad and husband. A loving son, brother and uncle. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. Dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will be deeply missed. We love him so much. His friends and family are shocked and devastated by his loss and ask that they are left to grieve alone in peace. The police have also released more details of Palmer’s career, he joined the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command in April 2016 and before that was in the territorial support group, based at Catford but patrolling and working across London. Before the TSG, he was based in Bromley borough between 2002 and 2009. Keith was 48 and joined the Met in November 2001. He was married with a five-year-old daughter. He was nominated in 2015 for best thief taker in the Commissioner’s Excellence Awards, having made more than 150 arrests in 12 months. PC James Aitkenhead, who worked alongside him in the TSG, called him a “genuinely nice person”. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that’s just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. He had a great work ethic, he worked on our warrants’ car for years, getting up at 4am to serve warrants and arresting wanted offenders. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early. In his personal life he was a massive Charlton Athletic fan and had a season ticket. We will miss him so much. Insp Mark Turner, from the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, who most recently worked withPalmer, said: He really was a solid reliable member of the team – he came in and just got the job done, quietly and efficiently. He was a fantastic member of staff and will be sorely missed. As a mark of respect, Palmer’s shoulder number – 4157U – will be retired and not reissued to any other officer. Jeremy Corbyn has been laying flowers on Westminster Bridge as a tribute to those killed yesterday. He also said he had signed the book of condolence for PC Keith Palmer. He said Palmer was “a great man who did a great job in parliament”. A woman from an inner-city Birmingham estate that was raided by anti-terror police has claimed the dead London terrorist was her neighbour. Iwona Romek, a factory worker who did not know the attacker’s name, described the killer as a father who was a keen gardener and lived with his Asian wife and young child. Romek, 45, who has lived in Quayside in Winson Green for 12 years, confirmed she knew the London terrorist when she was shown a photograph of him on the stretcher. I have been so shocked by it all. They were a nice family, very reserved. He was very calm. I saw the photos on the TV and knew it was the man who lived here. He had a wife, a young Asian woman, and a small child who went to school. Romek said the family moved out a few months ago. The house is now occupied by new tenants. On Thursday afternoon a police van remained parked outside the white front door. He was a nice guy. I used to see him outside doing his garden. Never any trouble. Romek said the man and his family moved out around Christmas very suddenly and did not say goodbye. Describing the late-night raid, she said officers had swarmed the terraced mews house. I just heard a lot of banging and shouting. They were shouting to open the door. It was all a bit scary. There was a helicopter above and men in white suits. The JustGiving page set up to support the family of PC Keith Palmer has now raised more than £100,000, a spokesman for the site said. It is now the fastest growing JustGiving crowdfunding page in history. The site reached its £100,000 target in just over six hours with donations from more than 5,500 members of the public. JustGiving has also made a donation of £10,000. Boris Johnson is addressing the UN security council in New York on Thursday. He was in Washington when the attack took place, where he was offered President Trump’s personal condolences by vice-president Mike Pence. Sources close to the former mayor of London said he was “shocked and disgusted” by the attack on his home city and that the terrorist attack underlined the importance of confronting Daesh [Isis], the topic of yesterday’s talks in the US capital. He is expected to travel on to Turkey, where he will discuss heightened aviation security measures. This is what he tweeted about the attack yesterday. Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) Heartbreaking.

outside in Westminster Watching the incident unfold from the press gallery inside the Houses of Parliament, George Eaton the political editor of the New Statesman told Sky News: \"I saw a large crowd fleeing the attacker who appeared to be carrying a knife, fleeing him from close to the Tube station. \"He then entered the gates of Parliament and charged at officers. We now know that one of them was sadly stabbed. He was then very swiftly shot by armed police.\" Kathy Casatelli, 58, saw a car rammed into the front gates of the palace and a man being treated on the floor. She said: \"We were coming up from the Tube and we walked out and there were officers there with their guns drawn. She said: ”I saw this car that was smashed into the gate. It was a grey BMW, it looked like a nice car. The whole windshield was smashed. \"There was a man on the ground, it looked like he was moving. I don't know if he was the driver.\" Police extended the cordon back up Broad Sanctuary beyond Westminster Abbey to the junction with Victoria Street. After the incident, Radoslaw Sikorski posted a video to Twitter purporting to show people lying injured in the road on Westminster Bridge. Mr Sikorski, a senior fellow at Harvard's Centre for European Studies, wrote: \"A car on Westminster Bridge has just mowed down at least five people.\" At least four people were seen lying on the ground, some bleeding heavily and apparently unconscious, on Westminster Bridge near Britain's parliament on Wednesday, Reuters photographs showed. One of the photographs showed a body lying under the wheels of a London bus. An assailant was shot outside parliament by armed police, the leader of the House of Commons said after loud bangs were heard with at least a dozen injured people on the nearby bridge. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: \"I can see people injured on Westminster bridge. There are a lot of ambulances. I was coming down the escalators with loads of other people and police suddenly stopped us all. There was no way back up and it was a bottleneck. It was very scary. “Everyone was panicking but the solidarity shown was inspiring. We're not sure if it was one or two attackers, or if it was the bloke in the 4x4 who attacked everyone on the bridge. I heard gunshots, but that was the police taking down the attacker.” Witness Quentin Letts said he saw a man in black attack a police officer outside Parliament before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the House of Commons. \"I saw a thick-set man in black clothes come through the gates into New Palace Yard, just below Big Ben,\" he told the BBC. \"He had something in his hand, it looked like a stick of some sort, and he was challenged by a couple of policemen in yellow jackets. \"And one of the yellow-jacketed policemen fell down and we could see the man in black moving his arm in a way that suggested he was stabbing or striking the yellow-jacketed policeman.\" PA Scotland Yard are treating the incident as a terror attack The other officer ran to get help and the man in black ran about 15 yards towards the entrance. Mr Letts said: \"As this attacker was running towards the entrance two plain-clothed guys with guns shouted at him what sounded like a warning, he ignored it and they shot two or three times and he fell.\" Kevin Schofield, the editor of PoliticsHome.com heard \"a very loud bang\" from the press gallery inside the Houses of Parliament followed by lots of shouting and men running around. He initially thought it was a car crash but then he looked outside the window to a heavily-guarded area outside which is out of bounds to the public. He told Sky News: \"Someone rushed through, attacked a policeman, a policeman went down, another policeman came and he was rescued. \"The man who had assaulted him got up and he appeared to be carrying either a knife or a gun. Then we heard gunfire, lots of gunfire, maybe five or six rounds. EPA Shocked witnesses said they saw bodies lying on the ground on Westminster Bridge near Parliament \"All I remember seeing is the man approaching the police officer probably with a knife and then there was gunfire. \"He was walking towards a second policeman with his arm outstretched, with what looked like a knife in his hand, having already assaulted another policeman. \"It was at that moment that you realised that something serious was happening - a man had broken in to Parliament and had a weapon.\" Steve Voake, 55, was walking across the Westminster Bridge towards the South Bank when he saw the aftermath. He said he saw at least two bodies lying on the road and one in the water. \"I saw a trainer lying in the road and when I looked more closely I saw that there were a couple of bodies the other side of the road,\" he told the Press Association. \"And when I looked over the side there was another body lying in the water with blood all around it.\" Westminster underground station has been closed and pedestrians moved away from the scene. One witness told Express.co.uk: \"There's no tubes, no taxis, and people can't even walk anywhere because the police are moving people further and further away. It's chaos.\" In the Commons, MP John Pugh says MPs are being evacuated from the building. Helicopters are circling overheard as officers at the scene say they are unable to confirm how long the cordon will be in place. Police have cordoned off the Mall to cars with officers seen in Trafalgar Square. EXPRESS The attacker struck on Westminster Bridge Metropolitan Police said in a statement: “Police are asking people to avoid the following areas: Parliament Square; Whitehall; Westminster Bridge; Lambeth Bridge; Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. “This is to allow the emergency services to deal with the ongoing incident. “Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. “Officers - including firearms officers - remain on the scene and we are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise. “We thank the public for their assistance. “Police are appealing for any members of the public who may have images or footage of the incident to send them to this address: www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk.”","title":"London

{"originalUrl":"http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/15192923._Love_for_all__hatred_for_none___Watford_Muslims_pay_respect_to_terror_attack_victims/?ref=wa","text":"Watford Muslims joined thousands of people on Westminster Bridge to pay their respects to the four people who were killed in last week’s terror attack. At 2.40pm on Wednesday, a week after Khalid Masood killed three pedestrians and stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death, crowds fell silent. Members of the Watford Chapter of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community were among the crowds, wearing t-shirts emblazoned with, “I’m a Muslim, ask me anything” and holding banners that read “love for all, hatred for none”. They stood side-by-side with Christian and Jewish faith leaders, tourists, locals and schoolchildren in remembrance of those who died. The Watford Ahmadiyya Muslim youth leader, Jawad Qamar, said: “It is the responsibility of all Muslims to show the true teachings of Islam which are peace, love, mercy and compassion. “We offer our deepest sympathies to all the victims and those affected. Our only response to this aggression is to deepen our bond of unity with our country and nation. “Our motto is ‘love for all and hatred for none’ and we truly believe this encompasses the message of Islam.” In the days following the attack, the caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmah, also spoke out. He said: “The terrorist attack in London, in which innocent and defenceless people were targeted, was completely abhorrent and cruel. “It is up to Muslims to stand up and reject all forms of extremism and terrorism. “Wherever and whenever such attacks take place they must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.” Ipsoregulated This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Editors' Code of Practice.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/790084/london-attack-pc-keith-palmer-funeral-police-told-no-uniform-travel-london-westminster","text":"POLICE officers attending PC Keith Palmer’s funeral today have been told not to wear their uniforms when travelling to Westminster for “personal safety reasons”. More than 5,000 police officers from every force in the UK have turned out to pay their final respects to hero PC Keith Palmer, who was killed in the line of duty during the London terror attack in March. The largest-ever gathering of British police officers will line the route to Southwark Cathedral, where the officer's funeral service is taking place. Changing cubicles have been provided for officers who have been advised not to travel to the city wearing their uniforms for “personal safety reasons”. The advisory has been issued by the Metropolitan Police Federation. GETTY Thousands of people will turn out to pay their respects to the murdered policeman Related articles About 50 members of PC Keith Palmer’s family, including his wife, daughter, parents and siblings, will attend the service. More than 50,000 members of the public are also expected to turn out to pay their respects to the murdered officer, who was stabbed to death outside Parliament during Khalid Masood’s murderous rampage across Westminster. Officers from the Metropolitan Police Service and from the wider service will be joined by colleagues from the forces of England and Wales to honour their fallen colleague. The Armed Forces will be represented at the funeral by a number of serving and former members. They will include an Officer and 21 soldiers from across the Regiment acting as ‘Route Markers’ outside of Southwark Cathedral. Two Royal Artillery Association Standard Bearers will attend as well as an Honourable Artillery Company Bugler. The bugler, Lance Corporal Graham Haynes of the Honourable Artillery Company, is also a serving officer within the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command. In addition, there will be a number of serving officers and soldiers from 106 (Y) Regiment Royal Artillery Regimental Headquarters and a small representation of serving officers and soldiers from 266 Battery 104 Regiment Royal Artillery. GETTY Officers changed in specially provided cubicles for 'safety reasons' The Senior Serving Officer in attendance will be Lieutenant General R E Nugee CVO CBE who is the Honorary Colonel of 106 (Y) RA. It is also expected that approximately 50 ex-serving Regimental personnel will be in attendance at the Cathedral, including Lt Colonel James Cleverly MP. PC Palmer's body was brought to the chapel at 2pm on Sunday, with a special escort by the Metropolitan Police, where it was greeted by a guard of honour. A group of officers wearing white gloves formed two lines to meet the vehicle as the coffin was carried inside. Uniformed police lined the edge of the square and crowds of people gathered to pay their respects. The 48-year-old's coffin was granted permission by the Queen to rest in Westminster's Chapel of St Mary Undercroft before his funeral. It is an honour normally reserved for heads of state and which was bestowed on former prime minister Margaret Thatcher and Labour politician Tony Benn.","title":"Police told NOT to travel in uniform

Compared with the year running up to the 2015 general election, much less money has been raised by political parties over the past year, according to Electoral Commission records. Over the previous recorded year of 2016, the Conservatives raised £19.5m, while Labour has raised £21.7m. The Liberal Democrats have raised £6.425m and the Scottish National party has raised £1.5m. The 2015 general election was the most expensive in history – the Conservatives managed to raise £38m and Labour got about £32m in the year before polling day, suggesting David Cameron probably outspent Ed Miliband. Under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has become almost wholly reliant upon donations from trade unions and individual members. In contrast, the Tories rely on money from individual wealthy donors. New donation and spending rules begin once the official “regulated period” begins, after an election is called and parliament is dissolved. Before the 2001 general election, there were no limits on what political parties could spend on national campaigns. The limit is calculated depending on how many seats a party contests; those that field candidates in all 650 seats are allowed to spend up to £19.5m, equivalent to £30,000 for each of the UK’s 650 constituencies. Each party must ensure it abides by the spending limits in Great Britain. Separate limits apply in Northern Ireland. UK political parties spent £31.1m for the 2010 general election. The Conservatives accounted for 53% of this total, the Labour party spent 25% of it and the Liberal Democrats 15%. Guardian/ICM poll gives Conservatives 18-point lead over Labour ICM carried out a state of the parties poll over the weekend. These are the first polling figures to be published since Theresa May’s announcement, although the fieldwork was carried out beforehand. Here are the figures. ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative sample of 2,052 adults aged 18+ online from 14 to 17 April 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. Since you’re here ... we’ve got a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever, but far fewer are paying for it. Advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce.

Police for several hours said the attacker had killed three people. Acting Deputy Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said Wednesday night that a fourth victim had died. The victims included London Metropolitan Police Constable Keith Palmer, 48, a 15-year veteran who was a husband and a father, Rowley said.

You hear a lot of sirens where we work; about one an hour I would guess. There was a chorus of them at around 3pm yesterday. Everyone in the office realised that something different was happening. Twitter kicked into action. For an hour or so, a scattering of tweets and photos filled in spots of detail, giving us a blurry picture, one pixel at a time, of what was apparently still going on. Then came the official media reports, clinging on to endlessly–repeated, solitary established facts, like they were so many pieces of wreckage from a disaster. By the evening news, we knew more: sequences and consequences, actions and reactions; but still not we really wanted to know: who did this and why? Strangely, given this general confusion and uncertainty, I spoke to a friend last night who told me exactly what had happened, and who had done it, and why he had done it, and why those who denied that the murder’s actions had anything to do with a particular religion were kidding no–one. You can join the dots. I’ll wager he wasn’t alone. I suspect he was right, and that this will be revealed as the deeds of a terrorist, motivated by (his understanding of) Islam to shed blood in the symbolic precincts of democratic liberty. But the speed with which he rushed to this judgement worried me. When violence of this nature erupts, we seek reassurance and return to established narratives. We know what’s going on even when, technically speaking, we don’t. A pre–existing narrative makes sense of the events. One such narrative widely prevalent today is that many British Muslims sympathise with acts like this and too few do enough to condemn them. In the likelihood of this narrative being further established, it is worth noting what the Muslim Council of Britain said yesterday straightaway or hearing the voice of New Horizons in British Islam: An attack on our democracy, the police, people on our streets, is an attack on our nation, on all of us. We condemn this act, an attack not just on the capital but on the values that people across Britain hold dear. We pay tribute to the bravery and prompt reaction of police officers and the emergency services, whose work keeps us safe… We urge people to report any suspicious activity to the Anti–Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321… Terrorist attacks like this seek to divide us, but they will fail and we will remain united. Rowan Williams was a few yards from the World Trade Centre when the first plane hit. He afterwards penned a short book entitled Writing in the Dust, in which he used the story of Jesus’ reaction to the woman caught in adultery to encourage a pause before response. Instead of responding immediately to the accusation and the imminent vengeance, Jesus “bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.” Instead of eye–balling an instant reaction to his famous advice about casting stones, “again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.” It is a good example to follow. When the atmosphere is thick with aggression and violence, we stop, pause, wait, and try to write something new. Nick is Senior Fellow at Theos.

The polling day for elections will ordinarily be the first Thursday in May every five years. The first such polling day will be on 7 May 2015. The Prime Minister will be able to defer, by statutory instrument, the polling day for such parliamentary general elections to a day not more than two months later than the scheduled polling day. The Act also makes provision to enable the holding of early parliamentary general elections. The trigger for such general elections would be either a vote of no confidence in the Government, following which the House of Commons did not pass a motion of confidence in a Government within 14 days, or a vote by at least two-thirds of all MPs in favour of an early election. There has also been speculation about May making an announcement relating to direct rule in Northern Ireland. But she has shown little interest in Northern Ireland affairs, and James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, would be expected to make an announcement of this kind. The City of London is gripped with excitement over Theresa May’s statement. The pound took an immediate dip, from $1.26 to $1.253, as traders brace for fresh political drama in Westminster. The pound versus the US dollar today Photograph: Thomson Reuters The selloff was triggered by talk of a snap general election, as Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: “The pound plunged like a stone on news that Prime Minister Theresa May is about to make a major announcement outside Number 10 at 11:15 (BST). The rumour mill says it’s going to be a snap election – that would throw up a huge cluster grenade of political risk, uncertainty and potential volatility in the markets. At the extreme this could even spark a reversal in the entire Brexit process. May would have to get parliament to agree to this but we know most MPs are positively brimming to head back to the polls to seek fresh mandates in the wake of the Brexit vote. The Tories have a thumping majority in the polls at the moment so the PM may just be gambling on significantly boosting her rather slender majority in Parliament. It’s an old cliche that markets hate uncertainty (also untrue, as some investors thrive on it). But right now, all the excitement in Downing Street is certainly weighing on the pound. Joshua Raymond (@Josh_RaymondUK) Current rumours on PM announcement: 1. Snap Election2. PM to resign on health Grounds3. No one has a clue#GBP Downing Street have had almost an hour now to discourage journalists from speculating about an early election. They are not doing that, which increases the chances that it will be an election announcement. Buckingham Palace has confirmed that the Queen is currently resident at Windsor Castle, my colleague Matthew Taylor reports. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act that was a consideration, because the prime minister had to see the Queen to call an election. Now that is no longer necessary, although David Cameron did call a courtesy call on the Queen before the 2015 election anyway. 2 - If May is going to call a surprise election, during the Brexit negotiations, now would be a good time to do it. May would be able to get the election out of way within about six weeks, which would not really interfere with the negotiations. The big advantage in having an election now is that during the negotiations she is almost certainly going to have to make compromises that will be unpalatable to hardline pro-leave voters and Tory MPs. If the election is in 2020, as it is meant to be, she may have to go to the polls explaining why the UK is still paying money to the EU, accepting European court of justice rulings etc. If she could win a majority now, she would be safe for another five years. 4 - The Crown Prosecution Service is due to make a decision quite soon about whether to charge Tories in relation to alleged over-spending at the general election in South Thanet and in other constituencies. An election now would eliminate the risk of prosecutions leading to byelections in these seats. 5 - May would have shown that she has learnt the lesson from Gordon Brown’s “election that never was” in 2007. He dithered over calling an election at a time when it would have suited him, but called it off at the last moment, having let public speculation get out of hand. May until now has firmly ruled out an election, meaning that if she called one now, it would come as a complete surprise. 2 - May has until now prided herself on being straightforward and being a prime minister who is just “getting on with the job”. 3 - There is no evidence that the public want an early election. In fact, having had the referendum last year, people may be suffering from voting fatigue. And there is some evidence that voters punish politicians who haul them to the polls unnecessarily. 4 - There are already important elections planned for 4 May. It is too late to hold a general election then, and so a general election campaign would have to start after then. Voters would end up with two elections within two months. 5 - A Conservative election victory now, with a large majority, would be a major boost to the SNP’s argument that Scotland needs to vote for independence to protect itself from permanent Tory rule.","title":"Poll suggests voters back Theresa May U-turn - as it happened | Politics | The

{"originalUrl":"http://www.starradioonline.com/news/local-news/westminster-attack-police-officer-killed-by-knifeman-in-major-terror-incident/","text":"A police officer has died after being stabbed by a knifeman in a terror attack outside the Houses of Parliament that has Westminster on lockdown Another woman was killed when the attacker ploughed his car into pedestrians on the pavement of Westminster Bridge by the parliament buildings before launching his assault on the police officers. A number of people were being treated in London hospitals after suffering \"catastrophic\" injuries in the attack. Witnesses described hearing people screaming and seeing bodies scatter as the car is understood to have mounted the pavement just in front of the Houses of Parliament. Another witness said they had seen a person in the River Thames - a woman was later rescued from the water. The car then smashed into railings surrounding the Palace of Westminster, close to Big Ben in Parliament Square, where the attacker got out and stabbed a policeman. As he approached a second officer, he was shot by armed police. A video has emerged showing two officers pulling up outside the Houses of Parliament and then the sounds of three shots rings out. Three police officers are said to be among those injured in the attack and the French prime minister had confirmed that three French teenage students had also been hurt in the incident. Foreign Office minister and former army office Tobias Ellwood gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to one of the police officers injured in the knife attack in New Palace Yard, the cobbled courtyard in front of Parliament. Parliament was immediately shut down and the Prime Minister bundled into a car as officers searched the building, evacuating floors one by one. However, the evacuation was delayed after a suspicious package was found in a vehicle and the bomb squad were called in to deal with it. Staff in other buildings around Westminster were being asked by police to stay inside their offices and Parliament was suspended for the day. Sightseers on the London Eye were being held inside the viewing pods. Scotland Yard said the attack was being treated \"as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise\". An air ambulance landed in Parliament Square and medics were treating a number of people who had been injured in the incident, including the man who had been shot by police. Pictures showed a number of people lying in the road on the bridge, another image showed a man lying bleeding at the foot of stairs next to the Parliament building. At least 10 people were treated on Westminster Bridge and a number of London hospitals had been put on alert, London Ambulance Service said. Witnesses described seeing an \"Asian guy in his 40s\" carrying a knife and running across the bridge and towards the Houses of Parliament. Alan Parry, of Sky Sports News, was at Westminster for a meeting when he heard \"an almighty crash\" just outside the underground station . He said he could see a vehicle on the other side of the road which had crashed into some railings. He said: \"There was smoke coming this vehicle. I walked on a few paces further and saw what I assumed to be either a pedestrian or a cyclist who had clearly been hit and wasn't moving, although he did then gently move. \"The guy who I assumed was the driver of this 4x4 got out of the car and suddenly sprinted away from the scene - that was followed by four of what sounded much like gunshots. \"All of a sudden all hell was let loose. Police descended everywhere and the whole area was locked down.\" Jayne Wilkinson said: \"We were taking photos of Big Ben and we saw all the people running towards us, and then there was an Asian guy in about his 40s carrying a knife about seven or eight inches long. \"And then there were three shots fired, and then we crossed the road and looked over. The man was on the floor with blood. \"He had a lightweight jacket on, dark trousers and a shirt. \"He was running through those gates, towards Parliament, and the police were chasing him.\" One of the key witnesses to the attack was the Acting Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. He was unable to make a statement because he was giving vital evidence to officers. Metropolitan Police Commander BJ Harrison said a \"terrorist incident\" had been declared and a \"full counter terrorism operation\" was under way. He said that officers had received a number of different reports which \"included a person in the river, a car in collision with pedestrians and a man armed with a knife\". He added: \"We know there are a number of casualties including police officers but at this stage we cannot confirm numbers or the nature of these injuries.\" The Government has said it will chair a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee later today. Buckingham Palace declined to comment about its security arrangements but it was clear some precautions had been taken as the gates, patrolled by armed police, had been closed. MSPs have delayed a vote on a possible second independence referendum in light of the attack.","title":"Westminster attack: Police officer killed by knifeman in major terror incident - Star

We will never be cowed by terrorism. We stand together, in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. We always have, and we always will.’ MPs will fall silent at 9.33am (Pictures: Reuters) (Picture: PA) Two people in overalls and masks were seen sorting through material near the area in New Palace Yard where the attacker was shot and Pc Keith Palmer stabbed, and an area in the courtyard remained cordoned off. The popular Terrace cafeteria was open and serving a hot breakfast as normal as MPs, peers and staff arrived for work. Advertisement Advertisement The Union flag was flying at half-mast over the Houses of Parliament and other nearby buildings. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said Westminster was a sombre place in the wake of the loss of a member of the parliamentary family. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video ‘The mood in Parliament will be pretty sombre,’ Sir Michael told the BBC. ‘We’ve lost one of our own parliamentary police officers, who we talk to every morning going in and out of Parliament, and who gave his life to protect Parliament. ‘It will be sombre, but I think you will also find determination. This was an attack on Parliament for a reason. ‘We come together in Parliament to discuss very sharp differences, but we do so respectfully and we do so together. That’s not what terrorists believe in, that’s not what they want. ‘It’s no accident that this was an attack on Parliament, and I think you will find a very real determination and solidarity that we reinforce the values that keep us together.’ A sombre calm hung over Westminster the morning after the attack. There were none of the large groups of tourists usually seen taking photos outside Big Ben. Instead the whole area was cordoned off as MPs and staff working in Parliament flashed their passes and filed quietly into an entrance at the side of the building. The police presence is heavy with dozens of officers, many armed with guns, keeping guard at the entrance. Advertisement But despite the shock of the terror attack, MPs were determined it will be business as usual in Parliament. SNP MP Alan Brown (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) told the Press Association on his way in: ‘I feel a slight sense of apprehension, but we can’t let the crimes of one person prevent the working of Parliament. ‘Obviously, our thoughts are with the family of the policeman and other people who were killed. ‘I suspect it will be an emotional day, it will certainly be a very sombre day, in Parliament. ‘Today it is back to business. ‘I’ve got a question on the order paper and a constituency matter to raise, so it is back to the day job of being an MP.’ Mr Brown had just voted in the division lobbies when the attack took place and he sought refuge with a group of other MPs in the members’ tea room, where they sat glued to the television as the events unfolded. He praised the bravery of Tobias Ellwood, the Foreign Office Minister who ran towards the gunfire and tried to save the life of Pc Keith Palmer, who died from his injuries. Mr Brown said: ‘I think that was so brave of him. ‘I saw the pictures showing him with blood on his face having tried to give CPR. ‘It is also a testament to the training he has received.’ Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told the Press Association: ‘Everything has to be seen to get back to normal as quickly as possible so that people realise that this sort of attack is ultimately a futile gesture. Advertisement ‘I think the police have been absolutely right not to release details of the attacker, to give it no publicity. ‘What happened yesterday was sordid, shameful and vile. ‘The attacker caused the most appalling carnage in the lives of 20 to 25 families. ‘I think everyone in Parliament will want to pay tribute to the security services and the police and how they responded yesterday, and the officer who tragically died.’ What happened outside Parliament?

Here's everything we know so far about the Westminster attack: Six people have died - a police officer, the attacker, a woman named as Aysha Frade, 43, US tourist Kurt Cochran, 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes and Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea who died 15 days after being pulled from the Thames.

Salih Khater, of Birmingham, is facing two counts of attempted murder, following the alleged attack in Westminster last Tuesday. The 29-year-old Sudanese-born suspect, who is a British citizen, is accused of deliberately driving his Ford Fiesta into pedestrians and cyclists before swerving towards police officers. At Westminster Magistrates Court today, prosecutor Samuel Main said: 'His choice of Parliament being an iconic national site and attempting to kill police officers guarding the Palace of Westminster suggests that he was trying to make a political statement. 'The Crown is therefore treating this case as terrorism.' Salih Khater, accused of crashing a car into cyclists and police outside Parliament, has appeared in court charged with attempted murder Khater faces two counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors are treating the case as terrorism Khater was arrested after a car crashed into cyclists before narrowly missing police last week Friends have described Khater as a quiet loner who spent much of his time listening to pop music, smoking shisha and surfing online at an internet cafe below his old flat in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham.

EPA Four people, including a police officer and an attacker, died and 40 others were injured in the attack at the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Bridge. PA Emergency services sealed off the area just after 14:40 GMT after an officer was killed and his attacker shot by armed police inside the gates. PA An air ambulance landed in the middle of Parliament Square as medics rushed to help. PA MP Tobias Ellwood tried to help save the officer after he was stabbed by giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. PA Nearby, police could be seen holding a gun to a man on the cobbles inside the grounds of the palace. AP The suspect was taken to a waiting ambulance on a stretcher. He was later confirmed to have died. Getty Images The prime minister was taken by police back to Downing Street from the House of Commons. Alison Baskerville Armed police looked after visitors inside Parliament as the Commons was suspended and the site went into lockdown. BBC Ambulance crews were treating people on Westminster Bridge and on the road down to Parliament Square after a car hit pedestrians. Getty Images They treated several people who were hit by the car, before it was driven into the railings of Parliament. Getty Images Those injured on the bridge were helped from the scene. Some had \"catastrophic\" injuries. Getty Images Tourists and Londoners were caught up as roads were closed. Reuters They rushed from the bridge and headed away from Parliament Square. AFP/Getty Images Tourists travelling on the London Eye at the time of the incident were stranded for three hours.

A woman was pulled from the river and treated for injuries. EPA People were told to avoid Parliament Square, Whitehall, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street to the junction of Broadway, and the Embankment between Westminster and Embankment Tube. Getty Images The attacks unfolded as the Scottish Parliament was debating holding a second referendum, where proceedings were stopped. PA Prime Minister Theresa May ordered flags to be lowered to half mast on government buildings as a mark of respect to those who died. Reuters Police and intelligence services remained on the scene into the evening as they continued their investigation into the Westminster attack. AFP/Getty Images In a statement outside Number 10, Mrs May called the attacks \"sick and depraved\". She said the streets of Westminster were \"ingrained with a spirit of freedom\" and \"any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to failure.\" Metropolitan Police The police officer killed in the attack at Westminster was later named by Scotland Yard as PC Keith Palmer. The 48-year-old husband and father was a member of the Met's parliamentary and diplomatic protection command and had 15 years service. Reuters Flowers were laid at the scene close to the scene of the attack.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1574694/Bishop-warns-of-no-go-zones-for-non-Muslims.html","text":"The Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, the Bishop of Rochester and the Church's only Asian bishop, says that people of a different race or faith face physical attack if they live or work in communities dominated by a strict Muslim ideology. The Muslim Council of Britain today described his comments as \"frantic scaremongering\", while William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, said the bishop had \"probably put it too strongly\". Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Bishop Nazir-Ali compares the threat to the use of intimidation by the far-Right, and says that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Christianity to be the nation's public religion in a multifaith, multicultural society. His comments come as a poll of the General Synod - the Church's parliament - shows that its senior leaders, including bishops, also believe that Britain is being damaged by large-scale immigration. Bishop Nazir-Ali, who was born in Pakistan, gives warning that attempts are being made to give Britain an increasingly Islamic character by introducing the call to prayer and wider use of sharia law, a legal system based on the Koran. In an attack on the Government's response to immigration and the influx of \"people of other faiths to these shores\", he blames its \"novel philosophy of multiculturalism\" for allowing society to become deeply divided, and accuses ministers of lacking a \"moral and spiritual vision\". Echoing Trevor Phillips, the chairman of the Commission for Equalities and Human Rights, who has said that the country is \"sleepwalking into segregation\", the bishop argues that multiculturalism has led to deep divisions. David Davis, the shadow home secretary, has accused Muslims of promoting a kind of \"voluntary apartheid\" by shutting themselves in closed societies and demanding immunity from criticism. In the Synod survey, to be published this week, bishops, senior clergy and influential churchgoers said that an increasingly multi-faith society threatens the country's Christian heritage and blamed the divisions on the Government's failure to integrate immigrants into their communities. It found that more than one in three believe that a mass influx of people of other faiths is diluting the Christian nature of Britain and only a quarter feel that they have been integrated into society. The overwhelming majority - 80 per cent - said that the Government has not upheld the place of religion in public life and up to 63 per cent fear that the Church will be disestablished within a generation, breaking a bond that has existed between the Church and State since the Reformation. Calls for disestablishment have grown following research showing that attendance at Mass has overtaken the number of worshippers at Church of England Sunday services. Bishop Nazir-Ali, whose father converted from Islam to Catholicism, was criticised by Ibrahim Mogra, of the Muslim Council of Britain. He said: \"It's irresponsible for a man of his position to make these comments. \"He should accept that Britain is a multicultural society in which we are free to follow our religion at the same time as being extremely proud to be British. We wouldn't allow 'no-go' areas to happen. I smell extreme intolerance when people criticise multiculturalism without proper evidence of what has gone wrong.\" But the Bishop's concerns are shared by other members of the General Synod. The Rt Rev Nicholas Reade, the Bishop of Blackburn, which has a large Muslim community, said that it was increasingly difficult for Christians to share their faith in areas where there was a high proportion of immigrants of other faiths. He believes that increasing pressure will be put on the Government to begin the process of disestablishment and end the preferential status given to the Church of England. \"The writing is on the wall,\" he said. Gordon Brown relinquished Downing Street's involvement in appointing bishops in one of his first facts as Prime Minister - a move viewed by some as a significant step towards disestablishment. Last night, Mr Davis said: \"Bishop Nazir-Ali has drawn attention to a deeply serious problem. The Government's confused and counter-productive approach risks creating a number of closed societies instead of one open, cohesive one. It generates the risk of encouraging radicalisation and creating home-grown terrorism.\" Inayat Bunglawala, assistant secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \"Bishop Nazir-Ali appears to be exercised by what he perceives as the decline in the influence of Christianity upon this country, but trying to frantically scaremonger about Islam and Muslims seems to us to be a rather unethical way of trying to reverse this. \"He talks about the rise of 'Islamic extremism' but fails to mention how some of the policies of our government and especially that of the United States in

{"originalUrl":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/25/manchester-arena-bombing-latest/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw","text":"Detectives have made \"immense\" progress in the investigation into the Manchester bombing and are confident they have arrested some \"key players\", Britain's top counter-terror officer has said. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police have made \"significant\" arrests and \"finds\" and have got hold of a \"large part of the network\" being sought over the atrocity. Mr Rowley said: \"They are very significant, these arrests. \"We are very happy we've got our hands around some of the key players that we are concerned about but there's still a little bit more to do.\" Fresh raids were carried earlier today as security services brace for more attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan beginning tomorrow. Islamic State has called on its followers to rise up in an “all-out war” on \"infidels” in the West. Saturday marks the start of a 30-day period of fasting and reflection in the Islamic world, which has in recent years seen a large increase in terror attacks. As detectives revealed the youngest man in custody over the Manchester attack is 18, early-hours searches were on Friday launched at a Manchester barbershop and a takeaway on Merseyside. Possible detonator of Manchester bomb in a picture released as part of US leaks It comes amid fears the attacker might have built a second device that is now in the hands of fellow jihadists. Security sources now believe he assembled the bomb himself after learning his trade in Libya. But the amount of material in his home has led to fears that he could have built more than one device and and distributed them to other British-based extremists. A security source told the Telegraph: \"The worry is there was enough to build two or three bombs and we can't rule that out.\" Police today revealed that the eight men in custody \"on suspicion of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act\" in connection with Monday's atrocity, which killed 22 people - including seven children - are aged between 18 and 38. Meanwhile, with the General Election campaign resuming, Jeremy Corbyn’s suggestion that Britain’s involvement in military action abroad is linked to the Manchester attack has been condemned as “twisted reasoning” by the Security Minister. The 22 Manchester attack victims - including seven children British police have resumed \"working closely\" with US authorities on the probe after a tense showdown between the allies over leaked intelligence. After Theresa May warned the transatlantic row risked hampering the \"special relationship\" between the UK and America, US Secretary of State is making his first official trip to Britain today. With Britain on critical alert, stay with us for the latest updates today amid the huge operation to dismantle a suspected \"network\" linked to Abedi. Rise in local hate crime since attack A spike in hate crime has hit Manchester in the wake of Monday's suicide bombing, Greater Manchester Police say. A total of 56 hate crimes were recorded by the force on Wednesday, a significant rise on the 28 reported on Monday. Chief constable Ian Hopkins said: \"Whilst we can't directly link this to the events of Monday night, we are continuing to monitor the situation and support our communities.\" \"Manchester has come together this week, the public has seen that, they have seen that compassion. \"But it is important that we continue to stand together here, in Greater Manchester. \"Particularly standing together against some of the hateful views that we have seen from a very small minority of the community that have no place here in Greater Manchester.\" He added: \"I have sent a personal message out to all the faith leaders and places of worship today and have thanked them for the support they have shown and stressed that hate crime will not be tolerated.\" 'A lot of the risk contained, but still some uncertainty' \"Having made enormous progress and made some significant arrests and had some significant finds, there still remain important lines of inquiry for us to pursue. \"We've got to try to understand everything we can about the dead terrorist, his associates. \"We need to understand the whole network and how they acquired and built the bomb that exploded on Monday night. \"It's going to take a little more time to close down those gaps in our understanding. \"We are working as fast as we can do because everyone wants answers to this.\" \"We've got a lot of the risk contained but we still have some uncertainty. \"As we chase down those lines of inquiry we will keep this strong policing presence. \"We need to grow our confidence that we have got every component of the network and we have got as full an understanding as possible about how the device was constructed and whether there's any remaining risk. \"Clearly we haven't covered all the territory we want to but we have covered a large part of it. \"Our confidence has been increasing over recent days but there's still more to do to get to the degree of confidence we want.\" Tourists gather for the Changing the Guard ceremonyCredit: John Stillwell/PA Cameras aloft, tourists crowd around The MallCredit: John Stillwell/PA The spokeswoman said a rehearsal for Trooping the Colour - also known as the Queen's Birthday Parade - which was due to be held today had been moved to next Wednesday. She said: \"This decision has been taken by General Officer Commanding London District as preparations were ahead of schedule. \"We take these rehearsals for Queen's Birthday Parade very seriously to ensure we are able to equal and even exceed the standards of excellence expected for this important and high-profile annual event.\" In January, it was confirmed Changing the Guard was switching to fixed days in the autumn and winter after security was stepped up in the wake of the Berlin terror attack. Extra police at Scottish Cup Final in Glasgow Enhanced policing and security will also be in place for Saturday's Scottish Cup Final at Hampden Park in Glasgow. Police Scotland are asking ticket holders for the match between Celtic and Aberdeen to arrive early to allow for checks, and to not take bags into the stadium. Superintendent Mark Hargreaves, match commander for the event, said: \"Whilst I understand that some people may be inconvenienced by the increased security, public safety is our priority and I am sure everyone in Scotland will co-operate with us and support this. \"There is no specific threat against Scotland, or the Scottish Cup Final; however, people should remain calm but vigilant and report anything suspicious to police.\" Great City Games and Great Manchester run to go ahead despite terror threat Manchester is hosting the Great City Games and Great Manchester run this weekend, putting pressure on the local police force. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: \"There are no military personnel patrolling Manchester but we are therefore able to receive additional armed policing support because of this plan. \"We are using this to help in our efforts enable the Manchester Games and Manchester 10k to go ahead. \"We are working with event organisers and Manchester City Council to review and enhance our safety and security.\" The athletics event will go ahead as planned on Friday afternoon and evening. Events start from 4.45pm and run until 7.20pm. Tillerson: The special relationship will withstand Manchester leaks Speaking on his first official visit to the UK, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US took \"full responsibility\" for and \"regrets\" the leaking of information from the Manchester bombing. A row erupted between the US and British authorities after a host of sensitive information, including photographs from the scene of the attack, was leaked to American news outlets in the wake of Monday's attack. Mr Tillerson said: \"This special relationship that exists between our two countries will certainly withstand this particular unfortunate event.\" Isil calls for more attacks on West at start of Ramadan European security services are bracing for more attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan beginning tomorrow, after Islamic State called on its followers to rise up in an “all-out war” on \"infidels” in the West, reports Middle East Correspondent Josie Ensor in Beirut. “Muslim brothers in Europe who can’t reach the Islamic State lands, attack them in their homes, their markets, their roads and their forums,” the jihadist group said in a message entitled Where are the lions of war? and published on YouTube. Defending themselves after the suicide attack on Manchester Arena, which left 22 mostly children and teenagers dead, the group said: “Do not despise the work. Your targeting of the so-called innocents and civilians is beloved by us and the most effective, so go forth and may you get a great reward or martyrdom in Ramadan.” Last year, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the late Isil spokesman, issued a call to arms to followers to carry out lone wolf attacks during the holy month. It was the bloodiest Ramadan month on record. Isil took credit for a lone jihadist gunman, an Afghan American who perpetrated America’s deadliest mass shooting in history and worst terrorism on US soil since 9/11 during early morning hours of June 12 at an Orlando gay nightclub, killing 49 and wounding 53. An Islamist jihadist then stabbed a police officer and his wife in a Paris suburb in front of their son. The killer explicitly claimed in a live broadcast of the murder that he was responding to Adnani’s call. Later that month, three Isil suicide bombers opened fire then blew themselves up at Istanbul’s main airport, killing 45 and wounding more than 250. The final global body count after the month-long rampage was 421 dead and 729 wounded. Hitting multiple targets in many different countries is designed to send the message that no person on earth is safe or can be protected from terrorism. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee, Home Secretary Amber Rudd disclosed that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has assessed that the terror threat level should remain at critical while the \"live\" police operation continues. The rating was raised to critical, the highest level, for the first time in a decade in the wake of the Manchester outrage. It indicates that an attack may be imminent. Jeremy Corbyn: It's not unpatriotic to question British foreign wars after Manchester attack Jeremy Corbyn has denied he is being unpatriotic by claiming that the deployment of British troops overseas is linked to the suicide bombing of a pop concert in Manchester, reports Christopher Hope and Laura Hughes. \"We are working closely with both the Football Association (FA) and Wembley to ensure this weekend’s iconic football matches pass off without incident. \"Together we have a long history of delivering safe and secure major sporting events. The focus is the safety and security of fans. \"Anyone coming to the FA Cup Final or the other play off matches over the weekend will see an increase in police numbers in and around the stadium. “This will include extra armed officers on foot patrol around the environs of the Stadium, and the deployment of police armoured vehicles to support road closures. “At Twickenham rugby fans will see more armed officers on foot around the stadium. “If you have a ticket for any of the matches please help us out. Arrive earlier as there will be additional security and entry searches which may take a bit longer than fans are used to. “Our operations will include a range of highly visible but also covert and discrete tactics and this will run far beyond the final whistle and away from specific stadia. This will also apply right throughout the transport network.\" Barbershop raided by police 'has not opened since Arena bombing' The owner of a shop next door to a barbershop raided by armed police overnight in Moss Side said the premises involved has not opened since Monday's suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena. It is understood that an armed response unit arrived at the Fade Away shop in Princess Road in the early hours of Friday and that the shutter to the barbershop was cut open at about 5.15am to gain access to the front door. A cordon was then placed around the building at 6am and stretched to an adjoining chemist, cafe and upstairs flats. The cordon was lifted at 10.40am. A marked police van is parked outside the store next to a bus stop with a number of uniformed officers guarding the cordon. A detective removes items from a barbers shop in Moss SideCredit: Christopher Furlong/Getty West Indian-born Byron Gibbs, 79, who has run Gibbs Hardware for the past 33 years, said that the shop next door had opened about 12 months ago. He said a number of men appeared to work there but had never come into his shop to buy anything. He said: \"I never go there to talk to them, I don't have my hair cut there. Everyone round here has noticed that the shop has not opened since Monday and they usually open every day, including Sundays.\" Mr Gibbs said he had recognised the face of suicide bomber Abedi from the television. Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi He said: \"I have seen him a few times just walking past in the street. I don't know if he used this barbershop or he is involved with anyone there. \"We're all shocked around here about what happened on Monday and how close we are to all this. You don't know who these people are.\" Earlier, Greater Manchester Police said they were searching a property in Moss Side in connection with Monday's attack and had also arrested a man in the area. A spokesman said: \"The search is being carried out at a separate property to the address where a man was arrested earlier this morning.\" The money raised from the Manchester show, at the O2 Ritz on May 30, will be donated to the Manchester Evening News' British Red Cross appeal, which was set up to help relatives of those affected by the tragedy. Speaking to the paper about his decision, he said: \"I just knew I had to. I'm not in it for the money. The gig was going to happen anyway and we all have to do what we can. I want to try and help pick people up. People like me, doing what we do, it's our duty to give people a good time.\" Jeremy Corbyn’s suggestion that Britain’s involvement in military action abroad is linked to terror attacks like the Manchester suicide bomb has been condemned as “twisted reasoning” by the Government’s Security Minister. Mr Corbyn will deliver a speech in London this morning in which he will point to \"the connections between wars the Government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home\". But Ben Wallace said the timing of Mr Corbyn’s speech is “appalling” and “crass” as he rejected the idea that there is a link between UK foreign policy and terror. Ben Wallace, the Security MinisterCredit: JULIAN SIMMONDS for The Telegraph Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m sitting here in Manchester, a place where 21 years ago the IRA detonated a bomb that injured 212 people. “That was the last terrorist act in Manchester. They are all terrorists. We have to be unequivocal that no amount of excuses, no amount of twisted reasoning about a foreign policy here or a foreign policy there can be an excuse. “The reality is these people hate our values. You only have to look at their propaganda to realise.” End of control orders to monitor terror suspects a 'grave mistake' A former independent terror watchdog has said it was a \"grave mistake\" to abolish control orders to monitor terrorism suspects. Lord Carlile said the sweeping powers \"may have saved dozens of lives\" between 2005 and 2011. The independent peer and top QC also urged Theresa May to use their replacements \"to their full effect now\", with just a handful of people currently subject to terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIMs). Control orders restricted the freedom of terrorism suspects and could be used to force people to move or restrict their use of phones and computers. But they were abolished by the coalition government in 2012 amid concerns over their impact on civil liberties. Lord Carlile told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"In my view control orders worked very well in the period between 2005 and 2011. Although they were criticised for breaching civil liberties, in fact they were upheld by the courts, every control order was subject to automatic review by senior judges. \"Fifty-three people were placed on control orders, 23 of them with relocation requirements and restrictions on their use of the internet and so on. \"I believe that may have saved dozens of lives and my view is that it was a grave mistake by the coalition government to remove control orders and to produce something more dilute. I do wish at least that TPIMs would be used to their full effect now.\" TPIMs place restrictions on those suspected of being involved in terrorism, but where there is not enough evidence to charge or deport them. Just seven people are subject to TPIMs at the moment, Lord Carlile said, adding that they were \"better than nothing\". Lord Carlile was previously a Liberal Democrat peer but quit the party given its stance on security issues. Pictures: Police raid barbershop after smashing open shutters A police cordon is in place around the Fade Away barbershop in Princess Road, Moss Side, after a police raid early today. The shutters were down on the shop but part of it appeared to have been smashed open to gain access to the front door. A cordon was then placed around the building at 6am, which stretches to an adjoining chemist, cafe and upstairs flats. A marked police van is parked outside the store next to a bus stop with a number of officers guarding the cordon.

A spokesman said: \"This phase of the operation is still in its infancy. There is currently no specific threat to Merseyside.\" Superintendent Louise Harrison said: \"I understand that this kind of activity can cause concern for people living in nearby communities and would like to thank them for their understanding and patience. “As a result of today’s operation, Merseyside Police is working very closely with community groups, community leaders, partner agencies and individuals to make sure concerns are addressed and that we provide the best possible service to local people. “Over the coming days and weeks we will be continuing to work with our local communities to address any concerns they may have. We always need the public’s help to defeat terrorism by being extra vigilant and letting us know of any suspicious behaviour or activity.” “Terrorists want to create discord in our communities, but Merseyside has a long history of our communities living and working together. This is a time for us all to work closely together and unite against those who seek, through violence and extremism, to divide us. “Public safety is the paramount concern for the police and will continue to be our top priority and we have a duty to act and protect the public. We cannot be complacent and cannot take chances in situations such as this and police and the security services must act on information received.” Sources believe Abedi may have used the £75 a night apartment to put all the components of the device together, before heading off late on Monday evening to make his way to the Manchester Arena where he killed 22 people. The use of two addresses to assemble the device was a tactic used by the 7/7 bombers who also spent months learning how to build a bomb at a training camp in Pakistan. Former Metropolitan Police officer, David Videcette, who helped investigate the tube bombings said it was likely Abedi had spent many months abroad practising how to assemble a device before returning to the UK. He said: \"This is not something you can just put together by reading a book or watching a YouTube video. He will have spent time at a camp somewhere, possibly in Libya, being shown how to do it. \"But once you have the skills and the materials, assembling the device itself can be done fairly quickly.\" Where the new searches are taking place St Helens Greater Manchester Police said officers have been carrying out searches at an address in the St Helens area of Merseyside this morning. A spokesman said: \"These searches are connected to Monday’s attack on the Manchester Arena, but this is a fast moving investigation and we are keeping an open mind at this stage.\" Moss Side Officers are also searching an address at a property in Moss Side in connection with the attack on the Manchester Arena on Monday. The search is being carried out at a separate property to the address where a man was arrested earlier this morning. A police spokesman said: \"As it stands ten people in total have been arrested in connection with the investigation, of which a man and a woman have since been released without charge. Eight men remain in custody for questioning.\" The Labour leader is expected to make a veiled attack on the Conservatives for underfunding the police service at a time of heightened threat, while linking Britain's overseas military campaigns with terrorism at home. Mark Rowley, the UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer, confirmed British chiefs had \"received fresh assurances\" from their overseas counterparts that they could be trusted with confidential material. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she expected the \"critical\" assessment of the terror threat - suggesting a fresh attack may be imminent - to remain in place in the coming days. Ms Rudd told BBC1's Question Time: \"During this period of 'critical', which we hope will only last for a few days - it could be longer, it will depend on the operation - we've pulled out additional support from the Army so we can go about our normal life.\" The developments followed a fraught day in which Greater Manchester Police severed intelligence-sharing ties with the US due to evidence being repeatedly passed to journalists without permission. \"While we do not usually comment on information-sharing arrangements with international law enforcement organisations, we want to emphasise that, having received fresh assurances, we are now working closely with our key partners around the world including all those in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance,\" Mr Rowley said. Abedi, who was known to security services for his radical views, was said to have been in close contact with family members moments before slaughtering concert-goers on Monday. Music fans were targeted at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in the worst terrorist attack on British soil since the July 7 bombing in London in 2005. As Abedi's route to mass murder continued to be probed: Downing Street announced the Government's emergency Cobra committee will meet in Whitehall on Friday morning to discuss the latest developments, chaired by the Home Secretary. Officers also carried out searches at properties in Manchester, Wigan and Nuneaton. A bomb disposal unit returned to the Wigan address on Thursday night so experts could examine \"potentially suspicious items\". British investigative efforts remained focused on smashing the potential terror ring which may have assisted Abedi, despite the belief of Libyan authorities that he acted alone. Twenty-three people remained in critical care across eight hospitals. They included five children at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. British Transport Police announced that specialist firearms officers are to patrol on trains nationwide for the first time. NHS England warned health organisations to \"ensure care is in place should it be needed\" as Britain remained on high alert in the run-up to the bank holiday weekend. A man and a woman arrested as part of the probe were released without charge. At the Nato summit in Brussels, Theresa May confronted Donald Trump with her concerns about security lapses which allowed crucial evidence to be handed to US journalists by his officials. He vowed to investigate, calling the leaks \"deeply troubling\" and warning the sources of the security lapse could be prosecuted. In the years leading up to Monday's attack, it was said Abedi was known to security services, but his risk to the public remained \"subject to review\" and MI5 considered him a \"former subject of interest\", a Whitehall source said. Police hunting the \"network\" behind his attack said they had made \"significant\" arrests and seized \"very important\" items in raids. Emergency services on the night and aftermath of the Manchester attack were criticised by the widower of one victim, who accused them of leaving families in the dark. Steve Howe, whose wife Alison, 45, died as she was waiting to collect their daughter from the concert, told Channel 4 News: \"I gave them all the details, all the information from security in the arena, no-one has rang us... I was so frustrated.\"","title":"Manchester bombing latest: Investigation making 'immense' progress as police 'get hold of 'large part of terror

{"originalUrl":"http://shariawatch.org.uk/?q=content%2Fletter-mp-after-pm-exonerates-islam-after-westminster-attack#.WNvJbDPFhrQ.twitter","text":"You are here Letter to MP After PM Exonerates Islam after Westminster Attack Tags: This letter was sent by a supporter of Sharia Watch to their MP after Theresa May effectively exonerated Islam following the Westminster attack: Dear xxxxx Given that sharia law mandates establishment of a caliphate and offensive jihad toward non-believers until Islamic hegemony is globally secured, I am puzzled why you asked in Parliament, \"Will the Prime Minister agree with me that what happened was not Islamic...\" Trying to wish away an intruder by closing ones eyes, thinking nice thoughts and singing Kumbaya will fail. Similarly, people will not end sharia-supremacism by pretending it has 'nothing to do with Islam': that just gives it plenty of space to operate globally as Western non-Islamic obfuscation and blindness continues. ...Certificates of authenticity attest to the English translation from the governments of Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia; al-Azhar University has certified that \"this translation corresponds to the Arabic original and conforms to the practice and faith of the orthodox Sunni community\". The manual's introduction states, \"The four Sunni schools of Islamic law, Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali, are identical in approximately 75 percent of their legal conclusions, while the remaining questions, variances within a single family of explainers of the Holy Koran and prophetic sunna, are traceable to methodological differences in understanding or authentication of the primary textual evidence, differing viewpoints sometimes reflected in even a single school\". While some development is possible within sharia-law, not every kind of change would be acceptable -- for example, the change must not be contrary to the basic teachings and objectives in Islam. Under Islamic law, injunctions laid down in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (Muhammad's way of life, as transmitted in traditional reports of his words, actions and approvals) cannot be changed by any human agency. Note also what is written on \"scholarly consensus\", p. 23>b7.0 - 24>b7.4: briefly \"When the four necessary integrals of consensus exist {see manual for definition}, the ruling agreed upon is an authoritative part of [sharia-law] that is obligatory to obey and not lawful to disobey. Nor can [jurists] of a succeeding era make the thing an object of new [independent reasoning], because the ruling on it, verified by scholarly consensus, is an absolute legal ruling which does not admit of being contravened or annulled.\" Though Islamic law makes allowances for an individual Muslim's circumstances (e.g being in environments unsupported of Islamic law), the only way to 'change' such rulings found in mainstream orthodox Islam as the mandate for caliphate, offensive jihad, and pressing forward for world domination under Islamic law, is to leave Islam or to become a Muslim who rejects the binding nature of these laws (and for some Muslims that, too, equates, with apostasy): the law has painted them into a corner. See p. 638>o25.0 - 645>o25.6 on caliphate and its obligatory nature; here is a brief excerpt from p. 638: \"The investiture of someone from the Islamic Community (Umma) able to fulfill the duties of the caliphate is obligatory by scholarly consensus, though scholars differ as to whether its obligatory character is established through reason or through Revealed Law.\" From p. 599>o9.0 - 606>o10.3 on jihad (war against non-Muslims): \"Jihad is a communal obligation. When enough people perform it to successfully accomplish it, it is no longer obligatory upon others\"; “If none of those concerned perform jihad, and it does not happen at all, then everyone who is aware that it is obligatory is guilty of sin, if there was a possibility of having performed it. In the time of the Prophet … jihad was a communal obligation after his emigration (hijra) to Medina. As for subsequent times, there are two possible states in respect to non-Muslims. The first is when they are in their own countries, in which case {offensive} jihad is a communal obligation … upon the Muslims each year. The second state is when non-Muslims invade a Muslim country or near to one, in which case jihad is personally obligatory upon the inhabitants of that country, who must repel the non-Muslims with whatever they can\"; \"The caliph makes war upon Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians (provided he has first invited them to enter Islam in faith and practice, and if they will not, then invited them to enter the social order of Islam by paying the non-Muslim poll tax (jizya)) ... until they become Muslim or else pay the [jizya] ... The caliph fights all other peoples until they become Muslim (according to the Hanafi school, peoples of all other religions ... are permitted to live under the protection of the Islamic state if they either become Muslim or agree to pay the poll tax, the sole exceptions to which are apostates from Islam and idol worshippers who are Arabs, neither of whom has any choice but becoming Muslim\"; \"Whoever enters Islam before being captured may not be killed or his property confiscated, or his young children taken captive. When a child or a woman is taken captive, they become slaves by the fact of capture, and the woman's previous marriage is immediately annulled\" (plus p. 932 w37.1 (2nd para.: \"whom their right hands own\" refers to their slaves; the Arabic chapter on slavery has not been translated)); \"Interests that justify making a truce are such things as Muslim weakness because of lack of numbers or materiel, or the hope of an enemy becoming Muslim … If the Muslims are weak, a truce may be made for ten years if necessary … It is not permissible to stipulate longer than that, save by means of new truces, each of which does not exceed ten years.\" Jihad al-talab (offensive jihad) is the sharia-law-based imperative to subjugate the world:http://www.meforum.org/2767/offensive-jihad. See p. 607>o11.0 - 609>o11.11 on non-Muslim subjects of an Islamic state. There are other sections of similar interest to non-Muslims (e.g p. 652>p1.0 - 653>p1.3 (on \"shirk\"); 664>p17.0 - 665>p17.3 (on homosexuality); p. 846>w4.0 - 851>w4.7 (on religious supersession, unbelievers, finality of Islam: for example, \"Previously revealed religions were valid in their own eras, as is attested to by many verses of the Holy Koran, but were abrogated by the universal message of Islam … {I}t is unbelief (kufr) to hold that the remnant cults now bearing the names of formerly valid religions, such as 'Christianity' or 'Judaism,' are acceptable to Allah Most High after He has sent the final Messenger … to the entire world … This is a matter over which there is no disagreement among Islamic scholars, and if English-speaking Muslims at times discuss it as if there were some question about it, the only reason can be that no one has yet offered them a translation of a scholarly Koranic exegesis (tafsir) to explain the accord between the various Koranic verses, and their agreement with the sunna\"; \"The Prophet … said: 'By Him in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, any person of this Community, any Jew, or any Christian who hears of me and dies without believing in what I have been sent with will be an inhabitant of hell.' This is a rigorously authenticated (sahih) hadith\"); p. 1040>x91 (on an element of Islamic eschatology, stating \"The Antichrist ... is Ibn Sayyad al-Masih al-Dajjal of Bani Isra'il\" {False Messiah of the Children of Israel}); and others; note that non-Muslim Arabic-reader Mark Durie has stated that p. 59>e4.3 on circumcision has been mistranslated and should read \"Circumcision is obligatory (for every male and female) by cutting off the piece of skin on the glans of the penis of the male, but circumcision of the female is by cutting out the clitoris\"). While it may not be tactful (toward Muslims who are not sharia-supremacists) nor prudent to ask the Prime Minister to affirm publicly the Islamic nature of the attack, surely asking her to confirm a falsehood as truth publicly undermines the nation's clarity and security?

{"originalUrl":"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/categories/emergencies/westminster-attack","text":"Crowdfunding to help victims of the Westminster attack Everyone's thoughts at JustGiving go out to all the victims and families of the attacks in London. Our community have responded by raising money to support those affected. If you'd like to support them, here are the pages that have already been set up. Supporting Kris Aves and two other officers Kris Aves suffered life-changing injuries as a result of the attack, and two other officers were hurt. Trevor from Police Hour is crowdfunding to help.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/parliament-attack-police-officer-four-dead-westminster","text":"Police and security services are investigating the background of the man who killed four people and injured dozens in a terrorist rampage at Westminster as security was visibly stepped up in the capital on Thursday. While the Houses of Parliament prepared to sit as normal, officers were attempting to establish the motivation and any terrorist links of the attacker – who was known to counter-terrorism officials – and look into his connections and associates. A raid was carried out by armed police overnight at a flat above a shop in Birmingham just west of the city centre, with surrounding roads closed for several hours. BBC Newsnight reported late on Wednesday that the vehicle used in the attack – a Hyundai i40 – could have been rented in Birmingham. A direct link between the two events is yet to be established, however, West Midlands police referred enquiries to the Metropolitan police in London, which said it would not be commenting for “operational reasons”. In London, extra officers – armed and unarmed – have been ordered onto the streets and Parliament Square remains closed as the capital wakes up. Westminster Bridge remains closed and the tube station is open but for interchange only. Up to 40 people were injured when a lone terrorist attacked Westminster, stabbing a police officer to death as he tried to storm parliament, and killing three members of the public as he careered through the heart of the capital in a 4x4 vehicle. The attacker was among those killed in the first mass-casualty terrorist attack on Britain in over a decade. The Commons and Lords were locked down for several hours because of fears of further attacks. PC Keith Palmer. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images The policeman who died was named as Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Service. He was married with children and had been a police officer for 15 years. The Met’s head of counter-terrorism, Mark Rowley, said the motivation of the attacker was assumed to be “Islamist related” and he had tried to enter parliament but had been stopped. Rowley said Palmer “was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen”. People fled for their lives as a Hyundai 4x4 driven by the terrorist at about 2.40pm indiscriminately ran into people on Westminster Bridge. The use of the vehicle to attack civilians was a direct copy of an Islamic State tactic used previously with murderous effect in Nice and Berlin. The vehicle then careered off the road on to pavement a few metres away from Big Ben and the attacker tried to storm parliament armed with a knife. Play Video 0:22 People flee parliament as gunshots ring out – video Moments later, a police officer who was guarding parliament was fatally stabbed. The attacker, dressed in black, was shot by another armed officer and died of his injuries. The Guardian understands the initial working theories of the police investigation are the attacker was inspired by Isis and was most likely a “lone actor”. The attacker was already known to counter-terrorism officials. Rowley said investigators were trying to establish the attacker’s associates and his preparations for the attack. Theresa May was rushed out of parliament as the attack unfolded and later chaired an emergency meeting of the government’s crisis committee, Cobra. Shortly before 9pm on Wednesday, her voice cracking with emotion, the prime minister confirmed that what she called the “sick and depraved” attack had been carried out by a single assailant. She also praised the bravery of the police and other emergency services, who “ran towards the danger, even as they encouraged others to move the other way”. The prime minister added that Britain’s threat level would remain at severe, where it has been for some time; but she struck a defiant tone, insisting it would be business as usual for MPs and Londoners on Thursday. “The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech,” she said. Rowley said: “This is a day that we had planned for – that we all hoped would never happen – but sadly it is now a reality.” On Wednesday night, a massive investigation involving Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command and domestic security service MI5 was under way. Police chiefs have ordered extra officers, armed and unarmed, on to the streets of the capital. Keeping the national terrorism threat level at severe means an attack is feared to be highly likely but there is no intelligence a specific plot is imminent. Parliament was filled with MPs at the time – a couple of hours after prime minister’s question time. They were alerted to the incident by the sound of shots being fired. Within minutes, David Lidington, the leader of the Commons, told stunned MPs: “What I am able to say to the house is there has been a serious incident within the estate. It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police.” A visual guide to the Westminster attack Read more Witnesses described how a scene of horror suddenly unfolded at what is one of the UK’s busiest tourist spots. Rob Lyon, 34, from Rugby, was walking along Westminster Bridge with a colleague when he saw a 4x4 vehicle travelling at high speed, hitting pedestrians. He said: “I heard a wheel definitely hit a kerb, quite a loud crunch noise, I looked up and saw a car clearly hitting people as it came towards me. A colleague I was with, James, I heard him sort of shout. I instinctively jumped off the pavement. I could see people being hit. And then the car just carried on up the bridge and I just looked around and was really in shock.” Radosław Sikorski, a former Polish foreign minister, saw at least five people lying on the ground after being “mown down” by a car. “I heard what I thought was just a collision and then I looked through the window of the taxi and saw someone down, obviously in great distress,” he said. Play Video 0:35 Members of the public helping the injured on Westminster Bridge – video Pictures emerged after the incident showing people lying injured on Westminster Bridge, some of them bleeding seriously. A woman was pulled alive from the Thames with serious injuries after having fallen into the water during the attack. The car then sped towards the Palace of Westminster, and came to a halt on the pavement, up against railings to the north of New Palace Yard, the green space adjacent to Big Ben, opposite an entrance to Westminster tube station. A man with a knife was then seen running through the gates of the Palace of Westminster, across New Palace Yard and stabbing a police officer. The attacker continued his rampage, targeting a second officer, according to witnesses. But he was shot by police as he approached, knife in hand. Witness Rick Longley said he saw the car crash into the railings and a man leaping out. He said: “We were just walking up to the station and there was a loud bang and a guy, someone, crashed a car and took some pedestrians out. “They were just laying there and then the whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben. A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman.” UK terror attacks since 11 September 2001 The Bournemouth MP, a former soldier, was pictured with blood on his forehead, helping the police officer in Parliament Square. Ellwood’s brother Jonathan was killed in the 2002 Bali terror attack. Two people could be seen lying within New Palace Yard, immediately outside Westminster Hall. The sitting in the House of Commons was suspended while police officers sealed off the area. Parliamentary staff were told to stay in their offices. Minutes after the incident, an air ambulance landed in Parliament Square, as sirens were heard outside, but the officer could not be saved. Up to 1,000 people were evacuated at various locations, including Westminster Abbey. It took several hours for parliament to be evacuated. The Westminster attack is a tragedy, but it’s not a threat to democracy | Simon Jenkins Read more Hospitals in London were put on alert and of the 20 injured, eight were taken to the major trauma centre at King’s College hospital, with two people in critical condition and six stable. Those at King’s were six men and two women. Two casualties were treated at St Thomas’ hospital, immediately opposite the Houses of Parliament, a man and a woman, both of whom were stable. The ambulance service said eight of those injured were treated at the scene. In a statement the Muslim Council of Britain said: “We condemn this attack and while it is still too early to speculate on the motives, our thoughts and prayers are for the victims and those affected. We pay tribute, too, to the police and emergency services who handled this with bravery. The Palace of Westminster is the centre of our democracy and we must all ensure that it continues to serve our country and its people with safety and security.” London mayor Sadiq Khan said in a video message: “London is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. We always have, and we always will. Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.” The headline of this article was changed on 23 March 2017 after the death toll from the terrorist attack was revised downwards from five to four.","title":"Westminster attack: police hunt for clues after four dead in 'sick and depraved' incident | UK news | The

You tell me 'we're united'. You put up there, Phillip Schofield, that as an act of defiance, you walked across Westminster Bridge? You are pathetic. You are pathetic. You walked across a bridge, you walked down a pavement? \"Dan Snow, you took a video on your way to work, showing pictures of pretty flowers? No you are not brave. You are not united. You are cowed. You happen to think, that that's the new normal? \"You happen to think, cracking on like you did yesterday, somehow shows that you are fighting back, that you are resilient? That is not good enough. \"The terrorists in this country have made it so that you now believe walking down a pavement, is brave. You now believe doing the things you always did, is somehow resilient? \"You now believe, just because you're still continent, what you're still doubly continent? Does that make you not cowed. Does that make us united? \"No it does not. This country is not united, you can stand there, just outside this building, you can see how cross I am, I'm really, really cross, in Leicester Square, you stand there in Trafalgar Square, with your little tea lights. \"You stand there with your hash tags. You stand there and make hearts up to the heavens, because you know ants do, when a few of them are stood on? The rest crack on like normal and wait for the next footstep to fall. \"My challenge to you; is that's exactly what we're doing to society, we're carrying on. We are in denial.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/restaurant-owner-fed-police-emergency-workers-free-troia-ibrahim-dogus-a7650031.html","text":"A Muslim-born restaurateur has told how he fed hundreds of emergency service workers for free in the aftermath of Wednesday's terror attack. When police ordered Ibrahim Dogus to evacuate and close his three restaurants in the wake of the incident, he decided to keep Troia, on Belvedere Road yards from Westminster Bridge, open so police officers had a place to eat and keep warm. “I went to one of the officers and said 'I can shut all the businesses, but I want you guys and all the emergency staff to use this place for food, drinks, and for warmth for free',” he told The Independent. “All these great people need our support. Some of them tried to give us money—one said, 'I'm a police officer, you have to take my money.' We said, 'We're not going to take any money from you.” Emergency workers eat at IbrahimDogus' Troia restaurant () Mr Dogus, the founder of the British Kebab Awards, kept the restaurant open until 11.30pm “until the last officer was fed”. He estimates he fed between 300 and 500 emergency workers from the police, London Ambulance Service, and London Fire Brigade. “We wanted to play our role in terms of supporting the emergency crew. This was happening right at our doorstep. If you walk two seconds on my doorstep I would be on the bridge. I use the bridge to take my kids to school, not on that day, but I live next to the area, I work next to the area.” All three of Mr Dogus' Kurdish restaurants—Troia, Cucina and Westminster Kitchen—were inside an exclusion zone cordoned off by police in the aftermath of Wednesday's attack. “It could have been any of us killed by these lunatics,” he said. “It's so terrible, but London has pulled together very quickly. The first day after business was quiet but now it's back to normal.” Mr Dogus said he was born into a Muslim family but does not currently practise any religion. A Muslim-led fund to support victims and victims’ families of the terror attack in Westminster, in which five people were killed including the attacker and 50 were injured, has raised more than

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/westminster-attack?utm_term=.cr1o0D0xp#.rrX7lRlao","text":"Everyone Arrested In Connection With The Westminster Attack Has Now Been Released Khalid Masood, born Adrian Russell Ajao, was named as the attacker. He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. Three civilians, Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, and a police officer, Keith Palmer, have been identified as his victims. What We Know So Far: Khalid Masood, 52, originally from Kent, was named as the Westminster attacker by the Metropolitan police. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. He had no prior terrorism offence convictions, although he had been previously investigated by security services as a \"peripheral figure\". Police released a picture of him on Friday. At least five people died — including a police officer and Masood — and 31 others required hospital treatment. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility through its news agency, calling the assailant – who it did not name – its \"soldier\". Map Shows Locations Of Incidents In Westminster Attack Chris Applegate / Tom Phillips / BuzzFeed News / Google Maps Updates Posted at Apr. 01, 2017, at 12:12 PM All people arrested in connection with the Westminster terror attack have now been released All those arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in Westminster have now been released and police will take no further action. A 30-year-old man arrested on March 26 in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and detained under the Terrorism Act was released on Sunday, Met police said in a statement. Eleven other people who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have also been released with no further action. The inquest into the death of Khalid Masood was adjourned on Thursday and a pre-inquest review has been set by the coroner for May 19. Posted at Mar. 30, 2017, at 17:46 PM London attacker killed by single gunshot to chest, coroner says Matt Dunham / AP The man who mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally attacking a police officer outside parliament was killed by a single gunshot to the chest, coroner's officials said. In all, Khalid Masood killed four people and injured more than 30 others in the March 22 attack before he was shot dead. One other person remains hospitalized in critical condition. Masood's cause of death was revealed Thursday in Westminster coroner's court, the Associated Press reported. —Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 28, 2017, at 07:17 AM Wife of Khalid Masood expresses her sorrow for those killed Dan Kitwood / Getty Images Rohey Hydara, wife of the man who attacked parliament last week, gave a statement through police in which she expressed her \"sadness\" for those who had lost their lives. \"I express my condolences to the families of the victims that have died and wish a speedy recovery to all the injured,\" the BBC reported her as saying. Hydara, believed to be Masood's second wife, also asked for privacy for \"our family, especially the children, at this difficult time\". It comes following the mother of Masood, who was born Adrian Elms, stating she was \"shocked\" and \"deeply saddened\" by the actions of her son. Masood, 52, drove a car across Parliament Bridge, injuring scores of people, before crashing the vehicle into railings at the side of the houses of parliament. He then assaulted police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries, before being shot dead by officers on the scene. Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 17:05 PM Mother of London attacker says she is \"deeply shocked\" by his actions Matt Dunham / AP The mother of the man who carried out the deadly attack in London says she is \"deeply shocked, saddened, and numbed\" by his actions. In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. —Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 16:13 PM No evidence Masood had any direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, Met police say More information has emerged about the actions of the man who killed four people – including a police officer – outside the houses of parliament before being shot dead. Speaking on Monday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for UK counterterrorism policing, said there was \"no evidence\" the man who took the name Khalid Masood in 2005, having been born Adrian Elms, had discussed his intentions prior to the assault. \"His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low-tech, low-cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of IS leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others.\" Basu continued that while there were no direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, \"there is clearly an interest in jihad\". He also said there was \"no evidence\" Masood had been radicalised in prison, adding that \"this is pure speculation at this time\". —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 17:24 PM Police make new arrest Richard Vernalls / PA Wire/PA Images Police in Birmingham on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested in Birmingham in connection with Wednesday's attack in Westminster, it was announced on Sunday night. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Meanwhile, UK home secretary Amber Rudd has said it is \"completely unacceptable\" that messages Khalid Masood may have sent on WhatsApp before launching his deadly attack remain encrypted. \"There should be no place for terrorists to hide,\" Rudd said on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. \"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:26 AM Police: Khalid Masood acted alone Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images The Metropolitan police have said they believe Westminster attacker Khalid Masood acted alone, and warned that we may never know why he acted as he did. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. \"We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned,\" said deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing. \"Even if he acted alone in the preparation we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts to bring reassurance to Londoners, and to provide answers and closure for the families of those killed and the victims and survivors of this atrocity.\" But Basu added: \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this. That understanding may have died with him. \"Nevertheless, we are determined to understand if Masood was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice.\" Appealing for members of the public to help the investigation into the killings, Basu said: \"If you knew Khalid Masood and had spoken to him in the months, weeks or days leading up to this attack please come forward.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:18 AM Family of murdered PC \"overwhelmed\" by support Metropolitan police The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer have said they are \"overwhelmed by the love and support\" they have received since the 48-year-old was killed. \"Most especially,\" a statement released through the Metropolitan police added, \"the outpouring of love and respect for our Keith.\" The statement said: \"We want to thank everyone who has reached out to us over the past few days for their kindness and generosity. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. \"We would also like to express our gratitude to the people who were with Keith in his last moments and who were working that day. There was nothing more you could have done. \"You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. We miss him so much, but we are also incredibly proud of Keith.\" Jack Taylor / Getty Images Tory MP Tobias Ellwood shakes hands with police outside parliament as he arrives for work the day after the attack. Meanwhile Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to Palmer after the officer had been stabbed by Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, has said he is \"heartbroken\" he could not save him. \"I am heartbroken that I could not do more for PC Keith Palmer who gave his life in holding the line against terrorism and defending democracy. I shall be writing to the family of PC Palmer to offer my sincere condolences,\" he said in a statement. \"I'm deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support, especially from the policing fraternity, which I now realise is as close knit as the military's in supporting its own. \"I played only a small part that day, doing what I was taught to do, and am honoured to have been invited to join the Privy Council afterwards. \"It is right that we concentrate our thoughts on the victims as we stand side by side to protect all that we hold dear, including our precious values and way of life which will always prevail.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 22:56 PM Police say deadly Westminster attack lasted 82 seconds Kirsty Wigglesworth / AP The deadly Westminster attack that left four people dead Wednesday began and was over within 82 seconds, police said Saturday. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this,\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said in a statement. \"That understanding may have died with him.\" Authorities believe he acted alone. \"Whilst the attack lasted only 82 seconds it will remain in the memories of many forever,\" Basu said. —Salvador Hernandez Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 17:40 PM Only one person remains in custody over Wednesday's attack On Saturday evening police revealed that one of the two people still in custody in connection with the attack in Westminster had been released. The 27-year-old man arrested late on Thursday in Birmingham was told he would face no further action. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London and bailed until the end of this month has also been released with no further action. Seven other people have also been released and one woman remains out on bail, meaning only one person remains in custody over Khalid Masood's attack –&nbsp;a 58-year-old man who was arrested on Thursday morning at an address in Birmingham, who is being detained under anti-terror laws. Two men still in custody in connection with attack Victoria Jones / PA Wire/PA Images Seven of the 11 people arrested by police investigating Khalid Masood's attack this week have now been released with no further action, it was announced last night. As well as the six people released from custody last night, a 35-year-old man has been released with no further police action, and a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until the end of the month. Both were arrested in Manchester. Meanwhile, two men remain in custody: a 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham on Thursday morning, and a 28-year-old man arrested later in the day at a separate address in the city. They are being detained under the Terrorism Act 2000. One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. She is due to return to police until a date later this month. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 20:17 PM Six people arrested in London attack investigation are released Christopher Furlong / Getty Images Authorities on Friday released six people who were arrested as part of the ongoing investigation into the attack in London. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Khalid Masood – born Adrian Elms – has been named as the man who killed four people and injured 50 others in an attack on Westminster on Wednesday. Here's everything we know about him. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 17:18 PM Muslim leaders in Birmingham are holding emergency meetings across the city There are concerns of a ramped up anti-Muslim backlash that communities may face following the London terror attack. Mahmooda Qureshi from Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism campaign group, told BuzzFeed News a rally was being organised in Birmingham city centre on Saturday, and said: \"It's to distance ourselves and that it has got nothing to do with Islam and to state: not in our name.\" Imams from major Birmingham mosques read sermons addressing the attacks, and called for \"unity\". At a packed Friday prayers with Muslims from all backgrounds, Sheikh Abdur Raheem McCarthy said in a sermon delivered in English that Muslims were \"blessed\" in the UK as they have freedom of faith. \"We also need to increase our relationship with the local community. And instead of making this divide us, let it bring us closer together and let us stand in solidarity against that which is wrong.\" After prayers, the imam read out a statement from the Metropolitan police reassuring the communities there would be extra patrols on the streets, and that the attack was by \"a terrorist and someone not of the faith\". Muhammad Afzal, the chairman of Birmingham Central Mosque, called for calm and said in a statement: \"We request all communities for the unity and calm.\" He added: \"We call upon those that may have even a shred of sympathy for the like-minded terrorists to shake their conscience and realise that such acts are the work of evil and not the work of God-fearing people.\" In the aftermath of Wednesday's attack in London, this photo of a woman walking along Westminster bridge went viral. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. —Rachael Krishna Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 14:29 PM Met police release image of Masood in appeal for information Met Police In an updated statement, the Met police clarified that Masood had previously gone by both Adrian Elms and Adrian Russell Ajao. \"He may also be known by a number of other names,\" they added. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 13:54 PM Downing Street says Google and Facebook \"can and must do more\" to fight extremism Alamy Downing Street added to pressure on Google and Facebook on Friday, warning the internet giants that they \"can and must do more\" to stop hateful and violent material appearing on their platforms. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. As a general point, however, he told reporters that the \"fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one\" and that the technology companies weren't, in the government's view, pulling their weight. \"Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure that this material is not disseminated,\" the Number 10 official said. \"And we have been clear repeatedly that we think they can and must do more. And we are always talking with them on how to achieve that.\" \"The message that we've delivered consistently is that we want them to do more and the ball is now in their court,\" he added. \"Let's see how they respond.\" First images of Masood as a schoolchild emerge Huntleys School Website This photograph, taken when Masood was at school, is believed to have been taken after a four-hour five-a-side tournament for charity. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. \"He had a big personality and everyone liked him,\" Till said. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. The fourth victim, 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes, was named by the Met police today. Rhodes was a retired window cleaner, who was described by neighbours as a \"lovely man,\" according to the Press Association. The neighbour told the news organisation Rhodes had no children and was not married, and that he \"would do anything for anybody\". American Kurt Cochran was identified yesterday. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. \" She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us,\" a spokesperson for the college told BuzzFeed News. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. In a statement on Thursday, his family said he would be remembered as a \"wonderful dad and husband,\" a loving son, brother, and uncle, and a long-time supporter of Charlton FC. He was a friend to \"everyone who knew him\" and was brave, dedicated, courageous, and proud to be a police officer, they said. Met police release more information about Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's birth name has been stated as Adrian Russell Ajao, acting deputy police commissioner Mark Rowley has said in a briefing outside New Scotland Yard this morning. \"We stated he had a number of aliases, and we do know that his birth name was Adrian Russell,\" Rowley said. Rowley said there was \"no evidence of further threats\", but that a \"large, fast paced investigation\" was examining Masood's actions leading up the attack: \"Our determination is to find out if he acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others encouraged or supported him.\" Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. \"We have seized 2,700 items from these searches,\" he said, including \"massive of amounts of computer data for us to search through\". Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. \"Those affected include a real cross-section of ages, from at least 12 nationalities,\" he continued. He said of those in hospital, two remained in \"critical condition\", with one person considered to have \"life-threatening\" injuries. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Details around the attacker, named by the Metropolitan police as 52-year-old Khalid Masood, continue to emerge on Friday morning. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Sadiq Khan, who spoke at the vigil, told BuzzFeed News it was a way of showing \"evil and twisted individuals\" that they were not going to be successful in their aims. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. Houses searched in Brighton and Wales Joe Giddens / PA Wire/PA Images Officers search an address in Birmingham connected to Wednesday's attack. The Metropolitan police have confirmed to BuzzFeed News that as part of today's investigations, houses were also searched in Brighton and Wales. Previously police had only said searches were carried out in London, Birmingham, and \"elsewhere\". The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Overnight a 39-year-old woman was arrested at an address in east London; a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man were arrested at an address in Birmingham; a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 26, 27, and 28 were arrested at a separate address in Birmingham – all on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. \"It's important to stress that we are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident and no police officers are under investigation,\" said IPCC deputy chair Sarah Green. \"The IPCC and the Metropolitan Police Service are following agreed working arrangements related to terrorist incidents, which are working well. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. We are giving this investigation the highest priority and we will conclude it as soon as possible.\" PM visits victims injured in the Westminster attack The PM quietly visited victims who were injured in the attack along Westminster Bridge on Thursday afternoon. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. – Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 16:16 PM Keith Palmer's family: \"A wonderful dad and husband\" Dominic Lipinski / PA Wire/PA Images In a statement, Palmer's family said the former soldier and policeman of 15 years was \"dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous\". Palmer, 48, who was married and had a 5-year-old daughter, was described as \"a wonderful dad and husband\". \"A loving son, brother and uncle. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. We love him so much,\" his family said. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. Colleague PC James Aitkenhead described him as \"a genuinely nice person; nobody had a bad word to say about him. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. \"He had a great work ethic, he worked on our warrants' car for years, getting up at 4am to serve warrants and arresting wanted offenders. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early.\" The 52-year-old was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said \"was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack\". He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was investigated \"some years ago\" as part of a historic investigation into violent extremism but was a peripheral figure. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been called on to retract his statement that the Westminster terror attack on Wednesday was linked to uncontrolled immigration – after it emerged that the security services believe the attacker was born in Britain. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. \"The moment has come for us to point the finger of blame. What these politicians have done in the last 15 years will affect how we live for 100 years,\" he said. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Kurt Cochran, from Utah, was killed in terror attack in Westminster, and his wife Melissa was seriously injured and is in hospital in London. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. \"We are grateful that she will recover,\" he said in the post. \"Our hearts ache for her and their children in losing their loving companion and father. Please continue to pray for our family. Thank you.\" Another relative, Shantell Payne, wrote in a separate Facebook post on Thursday: \"This pain is so heart wrenching and raw it has rocked our family and all that knew him to its core. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. RIP.\" After seeing a picture of his local liaison officer Søren D. Sozza in news coverage of the attack, Mark Oakley, who owns The Eagle pub in Vauxhall, situated near the attack, was moved to share his gratitude on Facebook. \"This image has reinforced my love and respect for the many officers who I have worked with for many years and seeing how close this terror is to where I live and work, and knowing that one of his colleagues was murdered on our streets has deeply saddened me tonight,\" he wrote. Sozza told BuzzFeed News he was \"humbled by Mark's very kind words of appreciation and am encouraged by his defiance to being affected by the incident\". World leaders express condolences for London and the British people Vladimir Putin, Russia's leader, released the following statement: \"Terrorist attacks are becoming increasingly cunning and cynical. It is obvious that all members of the international community should join forces to stand up against the terrorist threat.\" Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. Yesterday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said US president Donald Trump had spoken to Theresa May, and that the US was continuing to monitor the situation. German chancellor Angela Merkel, before more details about the nature of the attack had been established, said: \"Even if the background to these attacks has yet to be cleared up, I would like to emphasise on behalf of Germany and its citizens: We stand resolutely on Britain's side in the fight against any form of terrorism.\" François Hollande, France's leader, declared France's \"solidarity and support\" for Britain and the victims of the attack. \"Terrorism affects us all,\" he said. \"France, which has been so badly hit in recent times, knows what the British people are suffering today.\" The Netherlands' leader, Mark Rutte, said: \"Horrible images from London. The very heart of the city has been struck. Our thoughts are with the British people.\" And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. \"Belgium stands with UK in fight against terror,\" he said. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 13:20 PM Security services could have dropped monitoring attacker because of resources or the closure of an investigation Stressing they did not know the identity of the attacker, a former British intelligence officer told BuzzFeed News that \"peripheral figure\" would indicate an individual that MI5 would have looked into, and possibly monitored, for reasons of behaviour, background, or connections. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. An indiscriminate attack by a British-born terrorist was a strike against \"free people everywhere\" and injured people from various countries, Theresa May told the House of Commons on Thursday. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. The man had been investigated \"some years ago\" because of concerns about violent extremism but was considered a \"peripheral\" figure, May said. \"The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture,\" May said. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. \"We are not afraid. And our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,\" she said. Scotland's first minister has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful\" city of London Wpa Pool / Getty Images Nicola Sturgeon has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful city\" of London during a sombre edition of First Minister's Questions at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. \"Many of us in this chamber have friends and colleagues, indeed some of us have family members, who work within the Palace of Westminster,\" said Sturgeon. \"Parliamentarians, staff, and journalists. \"Yesterday was a harrowing day for all of them and they have our support and good wishes. Above all, we stand in solidarity with London – a vibrant, diverse, wonderful city that will never be cowed by mindless acts of violence.\" Sturgeon went on to confirm that there was \"no intelligence of any increased threat\" to Scotland in the wake of yesterday's attack in London, but added that security had been stepped up in \"key locations\" throughout the country. \"Acts of terrorism are not the responsibility of any one faith or section of our society,\" the first minister continued. \"The only people to blame for acts of terrorism are the individuals who plan and perpetrate them.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson expressed her \"deep shock\" at the events in London, but went on to warn would-be attackers: \"We will not be silenced, and we will not be cowed.\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale described Westminster as a \"beacon of democracy\", and went on to say that \"this cannot and must not turn into a war on any one community\". The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Following the attack, an image of a London Underground sign began to circulate on Twitter. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. \"My judgment is he or she speaks for the whole country irrespective of faith of creed when they wrote: 'All terrorists are politely reminded that this is London and whatever you do to us we will drink tea and jolly well carry on',\" he told the house. May called it a \"wonderful tribute\", and said it \"in a very simple way I think has encapsulated everything everybody in this house has said today\". \"What happened yesterday was an appalling atrocity,\" he said. \"Today, we are united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity. \"I express my condolences to the family and friends of PC Keith Palmer, who gave his life yesterday in defence of the public and our democracy – and to the loved ones of those still in a critical condition including the French schoolchildren visiting our capital from Concarneau in Brittany. ... \"I thank all the dedicated NHS staff working to save lives, including those from St Thomas' Hospital who rushed out to help those in need. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. \"It behoves us all not to rush to judgement, but to wait for the police to establish the facts. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred.\" The Scottish National Party's leader in the House of Commons Angus Robertson echoed May and Corbyn's sentiments, saying: \"Today of all days we are reminded that notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none.\" Robertson also paid tribute to police,and the bravery of the Conservative minister who went to the aid of the stabbed officer: \"'We are all hugely grateful to all the police, security staff and first responders who ran towards danger without concern to their safety, and I include in that our colleague the Right Honourable and gallant member for Bournemouth East Tobias Ellwood.\" Parliament is to review its security procedures in an emergency meeting later today in the wake of yesterday's terror attack. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. \"We will be having an emergency meeting,\" he said. \"We'll be getting information, what else needs to be put in place, and we will reflect, not instantly, we've got to take on board what's happened and we will make decisions accordingly. Of course, we've got to look after both houses.\" TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. People from 10 different countries caught up in attack, PM says Sky News screengrab Speaking in the Commons, Theresa May revealed some details about those injured in the attack. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. \"We are in close contact with the governments of the countries of all those affected,\" the prime minister said. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:49 AM PM Theresa May says attacker was \"British-born\" and had been previously investigated by MI5 as a \"peripheral\" figure Addressing the House of Commons, prime minister Theresa May confirmed that the attacker, who has still not been publicly identified, was known to MI5 and police and had been a \"peripheral figure\" in a \"historic\" investigation into violent extremism. \"It is still believed that this attacker acted alone and there is no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public,\" she said. \"His identity is known to police and MI5 and when operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. \"What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. Intensive investigations continue.\" May also reiterated earlier lines from the police and defence secretary Michael Fallon that the investigation is focusing on the \"working assumption\" the attacker was \"inspired by Islamist ideology\". \"We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real,\" she said. \"But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not – and will not – be cowed by this threat. \"As acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley has made clear, we are stepping up policing to protect communities across the country and to reassure the public.\" May praised the security and emergency forces for their swift and calm response to the attack, made more remarkable after they had \"lost one of their own\". \"We will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security, and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way,\" she said. \"On behalf of the whole country I want to pay tribute to them for the work they have been doing to reassure the public, treat the injured and bring security back to the streets of our capital city. \"That they have lost one of their own in yesterday's attack only makes their calmness and professionalism all the more remarkable.\" —James Ball and Francis Whittaker Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:43 AM Prime minister reveals nationalities of those wounded and more details on attacker in speech to House of Commons Westminster Bridge survivor: \"The car came out of nowhere\" Carl Court / Getty Images BuzzFeed News has spoken to a survivor who was hit by the attacker's car and flung to the ground on Westminster Bridge, and who said he was unable to describe the Wednesday's events because of the horrific aftermath. The survivor, who asked not to be named, was visiting London from Liverpool and sustained cuts and bruises to his legs – he was with friends who were also hit by the car but survived. He has now been discharged from hospital. \"There was just lot of yelling and commotion,\" he said. \"Then this car came out of nowhere and knocked me and my mates over. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. They were pretty horrific.\" —Pat Smith Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:23 AM Met police have made another arrest in connection to the attack In total eight people have now been arrested, following raids on six properties across the country. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 09:47 AM Minute's silence held for those killed in Westminster attack The streets around parliament remained closed on Thursday morning. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. \"Such acts of savagery against the innocent can never be justified,\" Fox said. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of those killed in Wednesday's attack on Westminster, her place of work confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Thursday morning. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. \"We are all deeply shocked and saddened at the news that one of the victims yesterday was a member of our staff, Aysha Frade. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. We will be offering every support we can to them as they try to come to terms with their devastating loss,\" Rachel Borland, principal at DLD College London, told BuzzFeed News. \"Aysha worked as a member of our administration team at the college. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us.\" According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Met police revise death toll to four, including attacker Four people, including the attacker, died in the attack on Westminster yesterday, the Metropolitan police confirmed to BuzzFeed News this morning following Commissioner Mark Rowley's earlier statement. Previous statements from New Scotland Yard had said that five people – including the attacker –&nbsp;had been killed in the assault outside the British parliament. Defence secretary Michael Fallon says security services' working assumption is that the attack was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\" Andy Buchanan / AFP / Getty Images Defence secretary Michael Fallon, speaking to the BBC's Today programme, said the \"working assumption\" was that the attack on Westminster was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\". Fallon said the Metropolitan police were making \"urgent\" investigations into the alleged attacker and his known associates – although he declined to state whether there was any indication he acted alone. \"The working assumption is that this is related to Islamic terrorism in some form, but they [the police] don't yet have a full enough picture of this man and his known associates. That work is still going on,\" he said. \"This kind of attack, this lone-wolf attack, using things from daily life, a vehicle, a knife, are much more difficult to forestall, and we are also dealing with a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage but simply wants to kill as many people as possible. \"This is a new element to international terrorism but our forces are working extremely hard. I have every confidence that they will track down his known associates.\" The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. \"Although there is intense security around the Palace of Westminster, London is going to work this morning,\" Fallon said. \"Parliament itself will resume at the normal time.\" \"London is getting back to work. London has seen this before and is taking it on the chin,\" he said. \"I do want to reassure you that the police and the security services are doing everything possible to make sure that people can go about their daily life as safely as possible.\" The Metropolitan police confirm seven arrests made last night Mark Rowley, the national lead for counterterrorism policing and the acting deputy commissioner, confirmed that seven arrests had been made, following raids on six properties across the country. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Among the dead were a \"mix of nationalities\", Rowley said, declining to name any of those killed other than 48-year-old police officer Keith Palmer. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. Probed on the identity of the alleged attacker, Rowley declined to comment on the individual's nationality and said he would not be naming the suspect – and urged the media to respect that decision. \"It is still our belief that this attacker acted alone, and was inspired by international terrorism,\" Rowley said. Meanwhile, he said London will see an increased police presence, as at least 60 officers continue working on a \"large and complicated crime scene\" outside Westminster. \"We must not allow terrorism to sow discord and fear in our city,\" he said. —Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 07:34 AM Police make ”several\" arrests following raid on property in Birmingham, multiple reports state Carl Court / Getty Images The police have made \"several\" arrests after a raid on a property in Birmingham, the BBC, ITV, and Sky News have reported. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Press inquiries to West Midlands police were redirected to the Metropolitan police, who declined to comment on the reports when contacted by BuzzFeed News, citing \"operational reasons\". Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. \"There is an ongoing police operation, no further details are being given at this stage,\" West Midlands police told The Guardian. Separately, it was reported the car – described by witnesses as a Hyundai 4x4 – used to plough through pedestrians in the cycle line on Westminster Bridge was believed to have been rented from near the raided property in Solihull. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner told the Today programme that there were \"indications\" that the car began its journey in Birmingham. Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 22:48 PM Slain officer is identified as death toll rises to 5 people BBC The death toll in Wednesday's Westminster attack rose to five people, including the attacker and a police officer, who was identified as a 15-year veteran. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Metro Police Getty Keith Palmer. \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that to happen,\" Rowley said. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. \"Terrorists have a clear aim: that is to create discord, destruction, and to create fear,\" he said. \"The police stand with all communities in the UK and will take action against anyone who seeks to undermine society, especially where their crimes are motivated by hate.\" —Claudia Koerner Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 21:27 PM Government officials describe crawling on hands and knees to escape attack Carl Court / Getty Images Grant Shapps was walking through from his office to a vote in the House of Commons, making small talk with a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, when he noticed something was amiss at the gates of parliament. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. \"I could hear a kerfuffle going on, which is not unusual as there's often protests by the gates,\" the former minister told BuzzFeed News. \"As I'm looking around I hear, 'BAM BAM BAM' – what sounded like four shots to me.\" \"Suddenly, a police officer is standing right where we are, shouting, 'Get down, get down, get back!' We crawled, hands and knees, back to a safety position.\" The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Prime minister Theresa May says attack targeted freedom and democracy BBC Theresa May on Wednesday night said the attack at Westminster was no accident, but rather a direct attack on British democracy. \"The location of this attack was no accident,\" the prime minister said in a speech outside Number 10. \"The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions, and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy, and freedom of speech.\" The single attacker first drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, May said, killing two people and injuring others – including three police officers. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. \"And we will all move forward together,\" she said, \"never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us.\" News reports identify wrong man as Westminster attacker A Channel 4 News report misidentified a man associated with a British Muslim terrorist group as the Westminster attacker on its evening broadcast. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The mistaken report was repeated at the top of the Channel 4+1 news, which began to rebroadcast the earlier report. The channel then went dark as \"conflicting information came to light,\" a Channel 4 News statement said. The first doctor to attend to those injured in the Westminster attack was not on duty at the time, but rushed to the scene when he heard screaming. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. \"I heard the screaming so ran to help and the police ran me in,\" he told us. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. —Laura Silver Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:30 PM Politicians and staff locked inside buildings in Westminster Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images Hundreds of politicians and their staff are still locked in Westminster Abbey, while police attempt to collect eyewitness testimony and evidence on this afternoon's attack. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. People still on the premises were then led into the ancient Westminster Hall at around 4.30pm – around 90 minutes after the attack. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Many were then led out through the St Stephen's Entrance into Westminster Abbey, where \"up to 1,000 people\" remain, according to one individual, who said others had been left in Westminster Hall. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. —Jim Waterson Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:08 PM Home secretary praises bravery of emergency services Daniel Sorabji / AFP / Getty Images Forensics officers at work at the scene. Home secretary Amber Rudd has released the following statement on the attack: \"We do not yet know the full impact of this terrible incident. But I know that the whole country will be thinking and praying for those who are affected, as I am. \"I want to thank the emergency services for the quick response and pay tribute to their bravery, their courage and their professionalism. \"I have been briefed by the Met Police and by the security services and the Security Minister has also been updated. This is an ongoing incident and the Government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. \"The Government's top priority is the security of its people and I urge everyone to remain calm but to be vigilant and if they see anything they are concerned about they should report it to the police. \"We have the best police, the best security services in the world and we must make sure that we let them get on with doing their job. \"The British people will be united in working together to defeat those who would harm our shared values. \"Values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law.

Values that will never be destroyed.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:03 PM Hospital releases latest update condition of those injured in attack King's College Hospital assistant medical director Dr Chris Palin has told the BBC eight patients from the attack are being treated at the Denmark Hill hospital. \"At 3.52pm we went into a major incident. We have received a total of eight patients,\" Palin said. \"Two of those are critically injured, six are stable. Six males and two females. Care is still ongoing. All eight remain in the hospital.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 18:58 PM Trump offers condolences to Theresa May during call about Westminster attack US president Donald Trump called the UK prime minister to offer support Wednesday afternoon. A readout of the call provided by the White House said: \"President Donald J. Trump spoke today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom to offer his condolences on today's terror attack in London and his praise for the effective response of security forces and first responders. \"He pledged the full cooperation and support of the United States Government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. \"We obviously condemn today's attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism, and we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation,\" he said. \"The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers. \"The city of London and Her Majesty's government have the full support of the US government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible.\" Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords will sit tomorrow at their normal times. —Alicia Melville-Smith Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 18:34 PM Witnesses on London Eye describe being kept in the air for hours Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images People are seen inside the pods of the London Eye during the incident Tourists on the London Eye, the landmark ferris wheel not far from parliament on the other side of the Thames, have described how they were kept in their capsules for three hours as the attack unfolded. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. \"The first thing we noticed was the flashing lights of medics attending to the injured people on the bridge, and then the helicopters,\" he told BuzzFeed News. \"There were three separate groups of injured people on the bridge, at each end and in the middle. It took half an hour before anyone was moved.\" He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Jim Hutchinson Kody and Taylor Davis, from Utah, told BuzzFeed News they were at the top of the London Eye when it came to a stop. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. \"We eventually managed to call our families and they told us what had happened.\" Taylor said they first had an idea something was wrong when they saw \"a big commotion and lots of stretchers\". Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. \"The attack started when a car was driven over Westminster Bridge hitting and injuring a number of members of the public, including three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony,\" Rowley said. He added that police \"we're satisfied at this stage that there looks to be only one attacker but it would be foolish to be over-confident so early on.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:48 PM Photograph appears to show knives at scene of parliament attack This photograph taken from inside the Palace of Westminster by PA's Stefan Rousseau shows an armed officer standing on what appears to be a knife.

The number of those injured has not been confirmed. \"Solidarity with our British friends, terribly stricken, full support to the injured French students, their families, and their comrades,\" he tweeted. —Sara Spary Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:30 PM Eyewitness describes hearing gunshots and seeing bodies on the ground at Westminster Matt Haikin was cycling across Westminster Bridge when he saw what he thought was a car crash. \"I saw a body, a man I think, lying in the road and a crashed car. I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. \"I didn't think anything else was going on until I saw lots of people gathered near the iron fences, and I went over. That's when I heard the gunshots.\" Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. \"It took a while for what had happened to sink in,\" he said. \"It wasn't scary while it happened, but now after the event, I'm shaken.\" Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:25 PM Met police say counterterrorism investigation is underway Jack Taylor / Getty Images Commander B.J. Harrington Scotland Yard's Commander B.J. Harrington said the Metropolitan police are remaining open-minded as to the motive at this stage, but that a full counterterrorism investigation is already underway. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. \"We received a number of different reports, which included a person in a river, a car in collision with pedestrians, and a man armed with a knife,\" he said. \"Officers were already in that location as part of routine policing. Immediately additional officers were sent to the scene, as were firearms officers.\" Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. \"Our response will be ongoing for some time and it is important that we gather all possible information and evidence,\" he said. \"Public safety is our top priority and we are reviewing our policing stance across London, and throughout the course of this afternoon there will be additional police and officers deployed across the capital.\" The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee later today, a spokeswoman in Downing Street said. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks. Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:12 PM Woman pulled from River Thames with serious injuries Daniel Leal-olivas / AFP / Getty Images A woman was pulled alive but seriously injured from the River Thames near Westminster Bridge in the wake of the incident. She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. He said: \"I was walking across Westminster Bridge and a bus stopped right in front of me and everybody started screaming. And I saw a trainer [shoe] in the road, and I thought somebody must have been hit by a car, and then I saw a body on the other side of the road, and then there was another body further up, and then when I looked over the side of the bridge there was another body in the river. \"I didn't see anything. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. \"They were lying face down in the water.\" The BBC later published camera footage of someone falling into the river as a speeding vehicle plows through: The London Ambulance Service Deputy Director of Operations Pauline Cranmer confirmed 10 people were treated by emergency services. \"We can confirm we have treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge and have put a number of hospitals on alert as we continue to respond to this incident,\" he said in a statement. \"We were called at 2.40pm today, with the first ambulance crew arriving within six minutes. \"We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, London's Air Ambulance and our Hazardous Area Response Team. \"We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to ensure patients receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. \"We have declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. \"As we are very busy dealing with this incident, we would ask the public to only call us in a genuine emergency.\" —James Ball Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:42 PM At least one dead and multiple casualties reported One woman has died, according to an anonymous medical source being quoted by multiple media outlets. There are also unconfirmed reports that several people have \"catastrophic injuries\". There have been separate and unconfirmed reports of up to three \"bodies\" on the bridge, including one \"face down in the water\" that have not been confirmed by police. Eyewitnesses, as well as social media accounts, appear to indicate a number of people were seriously hurt on Westminster Bridge. Earlier, a Reuters photographer, Toby Melville, published pictures of four individuals with injuries on the bridge. —Rose Buchanan and Sara Spary Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:35 PM London mayor confirms incidents are being treated as terrorism Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said that the incident is being treated as a terrorist attack until the police know otherwise. \"I have spoken to the Acting Commissioner. The Metropolitan Police Service is dealing with the incident and an urgent investigation is underway. My thoughts are with those affected and their families,\" he said \"I would like to express my thanks to the police and emergency services who work so hard to keep us safe and show tremendous bravery in exceptionally difficult circumstances,\" he added. Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:31 PM Photo shows police officer pointing gun at suspect on the ground This afternoon's Scottish parliament debate has been suspended in light of the incident in Westminster, but the Holyrood parliament has been strongly criticised for how long it took to make the decision. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Inside the chamber, outrage grew that the debate was continuing, with Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser requesting that business was suspended but the deputy presiding officer replying that it would be \"business as usual\". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. However, just before 4pm, presiding officer Ken Macintosh decided to suspend the sitting out of respect for \"our sister parliament\" and added there will be time to resume the debate in future. Davidson tweeted: \"Very pleased that sense has won the day & Holyrood has been suspended until we have a better understanding of what is going on in WM.\" Sturgeon added: \"My thoughts are with everyone in and around Westminster caught up in this dreadful incident – and with the brave emergency services.\" —Jamie Ross Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:02 PM Some MPs and peers have been evacuated from parliament Many politicians inside parliament have been evacuated by armed police, while some other areas remain in lockdown. MP Anna Soubry tweeted that her colleagues were being \"taken out of the library at gun point\" by counterterrorist police. In a statement, the Metropolitan police said: \"Police are asking people to avoid the following areas: Parliament Square; Whitehall; Westminster Bridge; Lambeth Bridge; Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. \"This is to allow the emergency services to deal with the ongoing incident. Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. \"Officers – including firearms officers – remain on the scene and we are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise.\" A police officer was stabbed at Westminster and the attacker was shot by armed police, the leader of the House of Commons said The leader of the House of Commons, David Lidington, has just spoken in parliament and said a police officer was stabbed. He said: \"First of all, colleagues will have appreciated that events have been moving rapidly and I want to emphasise that the knowledge that I have .... is so far very limited. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. \"It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police, an air ambulance is currently attending the scene to remove the casualties. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. \"I shall endeavour to do the very best I can, both at the despatch box and by communicating with my opposite numbers in other political parties to ensure that members are kept aware of what is happening, but at the moment, the very clear advice from the police and the director of security in the house is that we should remain under suspension and that the chamber should remain in lockdown until we receive advice that it is safe to go back to normal procedures.\" —Marie Le Conte Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 15:10 PM This is the scene outside parliament shortly after the incident Phil Han / BuzzFeed News Parliament Square is being closed and cleared, with an emergency helicopter parked in the middle of the area. Emergency services are attempting to revive one individual lying down on the pavement on Parliament Street, some way away from the entrance to the building.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/26/distinguish-violence-driven-by-ideology-from-sociopathic-rage","text":"Plastic candles lie along Westminster Bridge in tribute to the victims of the terrorist attack. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA What Khalid Masood wreaked on Westminster last week was depraved and shocking. It was not, however, another 7/7. The attacks on the tube and a bus by four suicide bombers on 7 July 2005 were relatively sophisticated; the bombers had been commissioned and trained by al-Qaida and their actions carefully choreographed. Wednesday’s attack was, in comparison, as crude and as low-tech as such attacks could be – a man causing mayhem armed simply with a car and a knife. The crudity of the Westminster attack is of a piece with much recent Islamist violence in Europe. There are certainly co-ordinated, well-planned operations, such as the slaughter on the streets of Paris in November 2015, in which 130 people lost their lives, and that in Brussels, a year to the day before the Westminster attack. Increasingly, though, jihadi violence involves individuals, without access to semtex or AK-47s, but with a desire to cause bloody turmoil. Low-tech terrorists driving vehicles into pedestrians is becoming more common, such as the assault on a Christmas market in Berlin last December, or, most horrifically, the truck attack on Bastille Day revellers in Nice last year. The day after the Westminster horror, a similar attack, in which a man tried to drive a car into a crowd, was foiled in Antwerp. Knife attacks, too, are becoming a common feature of low-tech terrorism, from the beheading of Lee Rigby on the streets of south London in 2013 by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, to the wounding in 2015 of three people in Leytonstone tube station in east London when 29-year-old Muhaydin Mire, ran amok with a knife, apparently as some form of deluded response to the war in Syria, to the murder last year of a priest, Father Jacques Hamel, in a church in Saint Etienne-du-Rouvray, in northern France by two teenage Islamists, Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean. What such attacks expose is the continuing degeneration of Islamist terror and the increasingly blurred lines between ideological violence and sociopathic rage. Last August, Zakaria Bulhan, a 19-year-old Norwegian of Somali descent, went on a rampage in Russell Square in London, stabbing six people, one of whom died from her injuries. It was originally seen as a terrorist incident. Later, Bulhan was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Last month, a court ordered him to be detained indefinitely in Broadmoor maximum security hospital. A week before Bulhan’s rampage, a 21-year-old Syrian refugee had hacked a woman to death in Reutlingen, near Stuttgart in Germany. That, too, was first regarded as a terrorist incident, only later as the actions of a mentally disturbed man. In both cases, many refused to believe that these were not terrorist incidents and social media spawned dark conspiracy theories of official cover-ups. Such theories may be irrational, but they reflect, too, the difficulty, often, in drawing a distinction between jihadi violence and the fury of disturbed minds. James Harris Jackson appears in court last week accused of killing a black man on the streets of New York. Photograph: Steven Hirsch/AP The death last week of Martin McGuinness, the former IRA leader, has led to much discussion about the relationship between the young, violent firebrand and the older patient peacemaker. What has been less discussed is the changing character of terrorism from the IRA to Islamic State. In the past, groups employing terror, whether the IRA or the PLO, were driven by specific political aims – a united Ireland or an independent Palestine. There was generally a close relationship between the organisation’s political cause and its violent activities. And, whatever one thinks of such groups, those activities were governed by certain norms and contained a rational kernel. Many civilians were certainly killed through IRA violence, but, unlike jihadis, the starting point of the IRA was not the mere killing of random individuals. It is the arbitrariness of jihadist violence, and its disregard for any moral bounds, that can make it seem so terrifying. Isis has claimed responsibility for the Westminster attack, calling Masood one of its “soldiers” (though it did not name him). Whether Masood had any real links to Isis remains unclear. “Soldiers of the Islamic State” are often just unstable young men with only the most tenuous relationship to Isis but driven by a sense of inchoate, personal rage. Masood’s story, a petty criminal, lacking direction, but converting to Islam after finding in Salafism a sense of order and meaning, and of making sense of his inner furies, is not unusual among jihadis. Deranged fury cloaked in ideological rage is not uniquely Islamist. Two days before Masood mowed down his victims on Westminster Bridge, James Harris Jackson allegedly stabbed to death Timothy Caughman in Manhattan. Jackson was white, Caughman black. Jackson is said to have come to New York from Baltimore armed with a knife and a sword and with the aim of killing as many black people as possible. “I hate blacks,” he allegedly told police. He chose to make New York the scene of his murderous act because it was “the media capital of the world” and he “wanted to make a statement”, investigators say. The police are uncertain whether Jackson had any formal links to racist groups. But, as with many Islamist killings, this stabbing blurs the line between ideological violence and psychotic rage. At his arraignment, the prosecutor called it “an act, most likely, of terrorism”. Defence counsel talked of Jackson’s “obvious psychological issues”. This murderous act is not an isolated incident. In 2015, Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old American obsessed with white supremacist ideas, shot dead nine African-American worshippers in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Last July, Ali David Sonboly went on a rampage in a Munich shopping mall, shooting dead nine people, and injuring another 36. He was of Iranian origin. But being Iranian meant to him not “Muslim”, but “Aryan”. He was obsessed by mass shootings and lauded Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian neo-Nazi. A month earlier, in Britain, Thomas Mair, a 53-year-old man with links to far-right groups, had shot and stabbed to death Jo Cox, a Labour MP, while she was campaigning in the EU referendum, in Birstall, Yorkshire. All this exposes both how the character of ideological violence has degenerated and how rage has become a feature of public life. The social and moral boundaries that act as firewalls against such behaviour have weakened. Western societies have become socially atomised. The influence of institutions that once helped socialise individuals and inculcate them with a sense of obligation to others, from the church to trade unions, has declined. So has that of progressive movements that gave social grievance a political form. Dylann Roof appears at a hearing in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Photograph: Reuters The Khalid Masoods and James Harris Jacksons of this world may be few but they are proliferating – angry, unbalanced individuals, detached from wider society and its norms, denied political outlets for their disaffections and who find in Islamism or white nationalism the salve for their resentments and justification for their actions. From one perspective, low-tech terrorism reveals the weaknesses of jihadi groups and the difficulties they have in organising more high-profile atrocities such as 7/7 or the Paris attacks. From another perspective, however, we have to accept that because such attacks are low-tech, they are more difficult to prevent. This raises questions about how the authorities, the media and the public should react to such events. The immediate response to the Masood attack – the courage of those who went to help the injured, the stoicism of Londoners carrying on as usual – was measured and inspiring. But the wall-to-wall media coverage and speculation that followed, and the high-publicity nationwide police operations, have had the effect of making a low-tech attack seem more like a major 7/7 kind of incident. The authorities need to gather information on perpetrators and ensure public safety. But what the past week has shown is the need to reset the balance between pursuing such aims and giving exaggerated weight to the attack. Otherwise the reaction to terror will itself provide the ‘statement’ that terrorists crave. While low-tech terror may become more common, we need to maintain a sense of perspective. The Westminster attack, like similar ones before it, reveals how easy it is to cause mayhem and disruption in an open, urban, society. But it should also remind us that, given how easy it is to sow terror, these kinds of attacks are relatively infrequent, even allowing for the fact that many are prevented before they come to fruition. Most people have access to cars and knives. The fact that such attacks are, nevertheless, so rare – and, hence, so shocking when they do occur – tells us something powerful about the enduring strength of social bonds.","title":"How can we

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/westminster-attack?utm_term=.lyGQOgP7d#.vuryxV2RM","text":"Everyone Arrested In Connection With The Westminster Attack Has Now Been Released Khalid Masood, born Adrian Russell Ajao, was named as the attacker. He was among those who died near parliament on March 22. Three civilians, Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, and a police officer, Keith Palmer, have been identified as his victims. What We Know So Far: Khalid Masood, 52, originally from Kent, was named as the Westminster attacker by the Metropolitan police. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao, the Met police said on Friday morning. Other aliases he is believed to have used include the name Adrian Elms. He had no prior terrorism offence convictions, although he had been previously investigated by security services as a \"peripheral figure\". Police released a picture of him on Friday. At least five people died — including a police officer and Masood — and 31 others required hospital treatment. Eleven arrests were made after several raids across the country, the Met confirmed. Everyone arrested has now been released with no further action. Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old unarmed officer, was stabbed before Masood was shot by police. A government minister administered CPR, but Palmer ultimately died. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of the civilians killed. Kurt Cochran, an American citizen, was named as among the dead. Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London, was later named as the fourth victim. The attack began when a vehicle driving over Westminster Bridge rammed into several pedestrians before crashing into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Masood, armed with a knife, continued the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility through its news agency, calling the assailant – who it did not name – its \"soldier\".

In a statement issued Monday, Janet Ajao said she in no way condoned the actions of her son Khalid Masood, who was shot dead by police during the attack, which killed four people: I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster. Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident. I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity. I wish to thank my friends, family and community from the bottom of my heart for the love and support given to us. —Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 16:13 PM No evidence Masood had any direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, Met police say More information has emerged about the actions of the man who killed four people – including a police officer – outside the houses of parliament before being shot dead. Speaking on Monday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for UK counterterrorism policing, said there was \"no evidence\" the man who took the name Khalid Masood in 2005, having been born Adrian Elms, had discussed his intentions prior to the assault. \"His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low-tech, low-cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of IS leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others.\" Basu continued that while there were no direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, \"there is clearly an interest in jihad\". He also said there was \"no evidence\" Masood had been radicalised in prison, adding that \"this is pure speculation at this time\". —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 17:24 PM Police make new arrest Richard Vernalls / PA Wire/PA Images Police in Birmingham on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested in Birmingham in connection with Wednesday's attack in Westminster, it was announced on Sunday night. The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. One other man, aged 58, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman has been bailed until later this month. Meanwhile, UK home secretary Amber Rudd has said it is \"completely unacceptable\" that messages Khalid Masood may have sent on WhatsApp before launching his deadly attack remain encrypted. \"There should be no place for terrorists to hide,\" Rudd said on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. \"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:26 AM Police: Khalid Masood acted alone Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images The Metropolitan police have said they believe Westminster attacker Khalid Masood acted alone, and warned that we may never know why he acted as he did. Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail. \"We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned,\" said deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing. \"Even if he acted alone in the preparation we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts to bring reassurance to Londoners, and to provide answers and closure for the families of those killed and the victims and survivors of this atrocity.\" But Basu added: \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this. That understanding may have died with him. \"Nevertheless, we are determined to understand if Masood was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice.\" Appealing for members of the public to help the investigation into the killings, Basu said: \"If you knew Khalid Masood and had spoken to him in the months, weeks or days leading up to this attack please come forward.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:18 AM Family of murdered PC \"overwhelmed\" by support Metropolitan police The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer have said they are \"overwhelmed by the love and support\" they have received since the 48-year-old was killed. \"Most especially,\" a statement released through the Metropolitan police added, \"the outpouring of love and respect for our Keith.\" The statement said: \"We want to thank everyone who has reached out to us over the past few days for their kindness and generosity. The police have been a constant, unwavering support at this very difficult time. It has made us realise what a caring, strong and supportive family Keith was part of during his career with the police. We can't thank them enough. \"We would also like to express our gratitude to the people who were with Keith in his last moments and who were working that day. There was nothing more you could have done. \"You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone. We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. We miss him so much, but we are also incredibly proud of Keith.\" Jack Taylor / Getty Images Tory MP Tobias Ellwood shakes hands with police outside parliament as he arrives for work the day after the attack. Meanwhile Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to Palmer after the officer had been stabbed by Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, has said he is \"heartbroken\" he could not save him. \"I am heartbroken that I could not do more for PC Keith Palmer who gave his life in holding the line against terrorism and defending democracy. I shall be writing to the family of PC Palmer to offer my sincere condolences,\" he said in a statement. \"I'm deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support, especially from the policing fraternity, which I now realise is as close knit as the military's in supporting its own. \"I played only a small part that day, doing what I was taught to do, and am honoured to have been invited to join the Privy Council afterwards. \"It is right that we concentrate our thoughts on the victims as we stand side by side to protect all that we hold dear, including our precious values and way of life which will always prevail.\" —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 22:56 PM Police say deadly Westminster attack lasted 82 seconds Kirsty Wigglesworth / AP The deadly Westminster attack that left four people dead Wednesday began and was over within 82 seconds, police said Saturday. Police released a timeline of the bloody attack, revealing that in just over a minute Khalid Masood killed three civilians and one police officer, and injured 31 other people. The attack began Wednesday at 2:40 p.m. when Masood drove his car over the Westminster Bridge and then veered on to the footpath. Masood drove through the pedestrian walkway for 30 seconds before crashing into a perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster, police said. Exactly 21 seconds after the crash, the first call to police was made. Masood then got out of his car and was shot by an officer inside the Palace of Westminster 31 seconds after that call was made. Police said their investigation is still continuing, and asked for people who knew and spoke with Masood in the previous weeks and months to contact authorities. \"We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this,\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said in a statement. \"That understanding may have died with him.\" Authorities believe he acted alone. \"Whilst the attack lasted only 82 seconds it will remain in the memories of many forever,\" Basu said. —Salvador Hernandez Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 17:40 PM Only one person remains in custody over Wednesday's attack On Saturday evening police revealed that one of the two people still in custody in connection with the attack in Westminster had been released.

She is due to return to police until a date later this month. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 20:17 PM Six people arrested in London attack investigation are released Christopher Furlong / Getty Images Authorities on Friday released six people who were arrested as part of the ongoing investigation into the attack in London. Among those released were a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man who were arrested at one address, as well as a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27, and 26, who were taken into custody at separate locations in Birmingham, the Metropolitan police announced. A 39-year-old woman arrested in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was also released on bail until a later date in March. Four others arrested in Birmingham and Manchester on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts remain in custody as part of a sweep of 21 locations. While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices. Khalid Masood – born Adrian Elms – has been named as the man who killed four people and injured 50 others in an attack on Westminster on Wednesday. Here's everything we know about him. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 17:18 PM Muslim leaders in Birmingham are holding emergency meetings across the city There are concerns of a ramped up anti-Muslim backlash that communities may face following the London terror attack. Mahmooda Qureshi from Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism campaign group, told BuzzFeed News a rally was being organised in Birmingham city centre on Saturday, and said: \"It's to distance ourselves and that it has got nothing to do with Islam and to state: not in our name.\" Imams from major Birmingham mosques read sermons addressing the attacks, and called for \"unity\". At a packed Friday prayers with Muslims from all backgrounds, Sheikh Abdur Raheem McCarthy said in a sermon delivered in English that Muslims were \"blessed\" in the UK as they have freedom of faith. \"We also need to increase our relationship with the local community. And instead of making this divide us, let it bring us closer together and let us stand in solidarity against that which is wrong.\" After prayers, the imam read out a statement from the Metropolitan police reassuring the communities there would be extra patrols on the streets, and that the attack was by \"a terrorist and someone not of the faith\". Muhammad Afzal, the chairman of Birmingham Central Mosque, called for calm and said in a statement: \"We request all communities for the unity and calm.\" He added: \"We call upon those that may have even a shred of sympathy for the like-minded terrorists to shake their conscience and realise that such acts are the work of evil and not the work of God-fearing people.\" In the aftermath of Wednesday's attack in London, this photo of a woman walking along Westminster bridge went viral. The woman was accused by people on the far-right of ignoring a victim on the road, and not showing emotion after the attack. Now the woman, who has not been named, has provided a statement defending herself via the charity TellMAMA: What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be any help, even though enough people were at the scene tending to victims. I then decided to call my family to say that i was fine and was making my way home from work, assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo station. My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families. I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence. —Rachael Krishna Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 14:29 PM Met police release image of Masood in appeal for information Met Police In an updated statement, the Met police clarified that Masood had previously gone by both Adrian Elms and Adrian Russell Ajao. \"He may also be known by a number of other names,\" they added. The statement also said the number of arrests had risen to 11. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on Friday at a location in Manchester on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Ten people remain in custody. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 24, 2017, at 13:54 PM Downing Street says Google and Facebook \"can and must do more\" to fight extremism Alamy Downing Street added to pressure on Google and Facebook on Friday, warning the internet giants that they \"can and must do more\" to stop hateful and violent material appearing on their platforms. Theresa May's official spokesperson would not comment on whether there was specific evidence that the internet had played a role in the apparent radicalisation of the Westminster attacker, Khalid Masood. As a general point, however, he told reporters that the \"fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one\" and that the technology companies weren't, in the government's view, pulling their weight. \"Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure that this material is not disseminated,\" the Number 10 official said. \"And we have been clear repeatedly that we think they can and must do more. And we are always talking with them on how to achieve that.\" \"The message that we've delivered consistently is that we want them to do more and the ball is now in their court,\" he added. \"Let's see how they respond.\" First images of Masood as a schoolchild emerge Huntleys School Website This photograph, taken when Masood was at school, is believed to have been taken after a four-hour five-a-side tournament for charity. Kenton Till, who was part of the charity team, described him to the BBC as an extremely popular student who was thought of as bright and sporty. \"He had a big personality and everyone liked him,\" Till said. It comes as details about Masood's background slowly begin to emerge. Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Earlier media reports had identified one of his aliases as Adrian Elms, born in the Dartford district of Kent. It is thought he took his stepfather's name, Ajao, after his mother remarried two years after he was born. It is believed Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". The BBC found he had recently lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. The fourth victim, 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes, was named by the Met police today. Rhodes was a retired window cleaner, who was described by neighbours as a \"lovely man,\" according to the Press Association. The neighbour told the news organisation Rhodes had no children and was not married, and that he \"would do anything for anybody\". American Kurt Cochran was identified yesterday. He and his wife Melissa Payne Cochran were thought to have been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Relatives said she suffered serious injuries in the attack and is still being treated in hospital. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" Aysha Frade, 43, was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The mother of two taught Spanish at DLD College London. \" She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us,\" a spokesperson for the college told BuzzFeed News. Veteran police officer Keith Palmer was killed. The 48-year-old was married with a five-year-old daughter. In a statement on Thursday, his family said he would be remembered as a \"wonderful dad and husband,\" a loving son, brother, and uncle, and a long-time supporter of Charlton FC. He was a friend to \"everyone who knew him\" and was brave, dedicated, courageous, and proud to be a police officer, they said. Met police release more information about Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's birth name has been stated as Adrian Russell Ajao, acting deputy police commissioner Mark Rowley has said in a briefing outside New Scotland Yard this morning. \"We stated he had a number of aliases, and we do know that his birth name was Adrian Russell,\" Rowley said. Rowley said there was \"no evidence of further threats\", but that a \"large, fast paced investigation\" was examining Masood's actions leading up the attack: \"Our determination is to find out if he acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others encouraged or supported him.\" Rowley said two further arrests were made last night: one in the West Midlands, and one in North West England. One woman has been released on bail. Nine people remain in custody. Five searches on addresses were in progress, with 16 searches on properties around the UK concluded. \"We have seized 2,700 items from these searches,\" he said, including \"massive of amounts of computer data for us to search through\". Addressing those injured in the attack, Rowley named the fourth victim as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham, in south London. The number of those hurt in the attack rose. Rowley stated at least 50 people were injured, with 31 people requiring hospital treatment, in the attack. \"Those affected include a real cross-section of ages, from at least 12 nationalities,\" he continued. He said of those in hospital, two remained in \"critical condition\", with one person considered to have \"life-threatening\" injuries. Two off-duty officers who were caught up in the assault on Westminster Bridge remain in hospital with serious injuries. Earlier, multiple media reports identified Adrian Elms as one of the alias believed to have been used by Masood. Details around the attacker, named by the Metropolitan police as 52-year-old Khalid Masood, continue to emerge on Friday morning. Masood, who operated under a number of aliases, is believed to have been born as Adrian Elms in Kent, the BBC reported. It is believed that Masood was an English teacher, The Sun also reported. The newspaper also claimed to have seen a recent copy of Masood's CV in which he claims to have an economics degree and describes himself as \"friendly and approachable\". Most recently he lived in the West Midlands, but he is also thought to have lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex, as well as Luton and east London. Masood had a chequered past, according to his police record. His first conviction was in November 1983, aged 19, when he was convicted for criminal damage. His last conviction was in 2003 when he stabbed a 22-year-old man in a nursing home in Eastbourne. He was charged and convicted of GBH, wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon, and served time in prison. Sadiq Khan, who spoke at the vigil, told BuzzFeed News it was a way of showing \"evil and twisted individuals\" that they were not going to be successful in their aims. The home secretary Amber Rudd also addressed the crowd to pay tribute to PC Keith Palmer. Houses searched in Brighton and Wales Joe Giddens / PA Wire/PA Images Officers search an address in Birmingham connected to Wednesday's attack. The Metropolitan police have confirmed to BuzzFeed News that as part of today's investigations, houses were also searched in Brighton and Wales. Previously police had only said searches were carried out in London, Birmingham, and \"elsewhere\". The news was confirmed by the Met after Norfolk police issued a statement on their website announcing the searches had been carried out. The Met said searches were ongoing at an address in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham, and one in east London. Searches at addresses in Brighton and southeast London have concluded. New information has also been released about the arrests made since yesterday's attack. Overnight a 39-year-old woman was arrested at an address in east London; a 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man were arrested at an address in Birmingham; a 26-year-old woman and three men aged 26, 27, and 28 were arrested at a separate address in Birmingham – all on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Police have said they believed the attack's perpetrator, Khalid Masood, had acted alone. A 58-year-old man was also arrested at a separate address in Birmingham this morning, also on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Meanwhile the police watchdog the IPCC says it has opened an independent investigation into the fatal police shooting of Masood. \"It's important to stress that we are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident and no police officers are under investigation,\" said IPCC deputy chair Sarah Green. \"The IPCC and the Metropolitan Police Service are following agreed working arrangements related to terrorist incidents, which are working well. I recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. We are giving this investigation the highest priority and we will conclude it as soon as possible.\" PM visits victims injured in the Westminster attack The PM quietly visited victims who were injured in the attack along Westminster Bridge on Thursday afternoon. In a private visit to an unnamed hospital, Theresa May spent about 40 minutes speaking to victims of yesterday's attacks and hospital staff. – Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 16:16 PM Keith Palmer's family: \"A wonderful dad and husband\" Dominic Lipinski / PA Wire/PA Images In a statement, Palmer's family said the former soldier and policeman of 15 years was \"dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous\". Palmer, 48, who was married and had a 5-year-old daughter, was described as \"a wonderful dad and husband\". \"A loving son, brother and uncle. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will bet deeply missed. We love him so much,\" his family said. The statement came shortly before a number of Palmer's colleagues were due to lay a wreath outside New Scotland Yard in his memory. Colleague PC James Aitkenhead described him as \"a genuinely nice person; nobody had a bad word to say about him. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. \"He had a great work ethic, he worked on our warrants' car for years, getting up at 4am to serve warrants and arresting wanted offenders. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early.\" The 52-year-old was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was also known by a number of aliases. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said \"was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack\". He had a range of previous convictions, although none for terrorism offences, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was investigated \"some years ago\" as part of a historic investigation into violent extremism but was a peripheral figure. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been called on to retract his statement that the Westminster terror attack on Wednesday was linked to uncontrolled immigration – after it emerged that the security services believe the attacker was born in Britain. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night after the attack, Farage said recent terrorism was the fault of politicians who advocated mass immigration. \"The moment has come for us to point the finger of blame. What these politicians have done in the last 15 years will affect how we live for 100 years,\" he said. Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services. Kurt Cochran, from Utah, was killed in terror attack in Westminster, and his wife Melissa was seriously injured and is in hospital in London. The couple were in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Clint Payne, understood to be Kurt's brother-in-law, wrote on Facebook: \"Our hearts are broken this day as we say goodbye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt. He passed away from the injuries sustained in the London terrorist attack yesterday. We love him so much and will never forget him.\" He said his sister, Melissa sustained a broken leg, broken rib and a cut to her head. \"We are grateful that she will recover,\" he said in the post. \"Our hearts ache for her and their children in losing their loving companion and father. Please continue to pray for our family. Thank you.\" Another relative, Shantell Payne, wrote in a separate Facebook post on Thursday: \"This pain is so heart wrenching and raw it has rocked our family and all that knew him to its core. We will miss Kurt beyond words. We love you Kurt. RIP.\" After seeing a picture of his local liaison officer Søren D. Sozza in news coverage of the attack, Mark Oakley, who owns The Eagle pub in Vauxhall, situated near the attack, was moved to share his gratitude on Facebook. \"This image has reinforced my love and respect for the many officers who I have worked with for many years and seeing how close this terror is to where I live and work, and knowing that one of his colleagues was murdered on our streets has deeply saddened me tonight,\" he wrote. Sozza told BuzzFeed News he was \"humbled by Mark's very kind words of appreciation and am encouraged by his defiance to being affected by the incident\". World leaders express condolences for London and the British people Vladimir Putin, Russia's leader, released the following statement: \"Terrorist attacks are becoming increasingly cunning and cynical. It is obvious that all members of the international community should join forces to stand up against the terrorist threat.\" Earlier, former US president Barack Obama tweeted his support and his sorrow for those killed. Yesterday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said US president Donald Trump had spoken to Theresa May, and that the US was continuing to monitor the situation. German chancellor Angela Merkel, before more details about the nature of the attack had been established, said: \"Even if the background to these attacks has yet to be cleared up, I would like to emphasise on behalf of Germany and its citizens: We stand resolutely on Britain's side in the fight against any form of terrorism.\" François Hollande, France's leader, declared France's \"solidarity and support\" for Britain and the victims of the attack. \"Terrorism affects us all,\" he said. \"France, which has been so badly hit in recent times, knows what the British people are suffering today.\" The Netherlands' leader, Mark Rutte, said: \"Horrible images from London. The very heart of the city has been struck. Our thoughts are with the British people.\" And Belgium's leader, Charles Michel, who only yesterday marked the year anniversary of a terror attack on Brussels, expressed his condolences with London and the British people. \"Belgium stands with UK in fight against terror,\" he said. —Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 13:20 PM Security services could have dropped monitoring attacker because of resources or the closure of an investigation Stressing they did not know the identity of the attacker, a former British intelligence officer told BuzzFeed News that \"peripheral figure\" would indicate an individual that MI5 would have looked into, and possibly monitored, for reasons of behaviour, background, or connections. After a period of time, the investigation would have been dropped for a number of reasons, including human rights law that demands surveillance be proportional, resources, or the closure of an investigation, but it is difficult to speculate on these until the identity of the attacker is known. An indiscriminate attack by a British-born terrorist was a strike against \"free people everywhere\" and injured people from various countries, Theresa May told the House of Commons on Thursday. Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services. The man had been investigated \"some years ago\" because of concerns about violent extremism but was considered a \"peripheral\" figure, May said. \"The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture,\" May said. May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, at 7.30pm on Wednesday night. She will have further briefings and meetings with security officials throughout Thursday. There was no intelligence suggesting another attack was imminent. Echoing defiant comments and tributes to the security authorities made by MPs in the House throughout the morning, the prime minister insisted Britain would not be cowed. \"We are not afraid. And our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,\" she said. Scotland's first minister has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful\" city of London Wpa Pool / Getty Images Nicola Sturgeon has paid tribute to the \"vibrant, diverse, and wonderful city\" of London during a sombre edition of First Minister's Questions at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. The weekly event, where the first minister is usually grilled by the four opposition leaders, was dominated this afternoon by tributes to those who lost their lives or were injured in yesterday's attack at Westminster. \"Many of us in this chamber have friends and colleagues, indeed some of us have family members, who work within the Palace of Westminster,\" said Sturgeon. \"Parliamentarians, staff, and journalists. \"Yesterday was a harrowing day for all of them and they have our support and good wishes. Above all, we stand in solidarity with London – a vibrant, diverse, wonderful city that will never be cowed by mindless acts of violence.\" Sturgeon went on to confirm that there was \"no intelligence of any increased threat\" to Scotland in the wake of yesterday's attack in London, but added that security had been stepped up in \"key locations\" throughout the country. \"Acts of terrorism are not the responsibility of any one faith or section of our society,\" the first minister continued. \"The only people to blame for acts of terrorism are the individuals who plan and perpetrate them.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson expressed her \"deep shock\" at the events in London, but went on to warn would-be attackers: \"We will not be silenced, and we will not be cowed.\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale described Westminster as a \"beacon of democracy\", and went on to say that \"this cannot and must not turn into a war on any one community\". The Scottish parliament was debating a referendum on independence when news of yesterday's attack broke and the session was cancelled. It was confirmed this morning that the debate will continue on Tuesday next week. Following the attack, an image of a London Underground sign began to circulate on Twitter. However, immediately after the sign was shared, it was quickly shown to be fake. The sign appears to have been created using an online generator. On Thursday, MP Simon Hoare raised the sign in the Commons. \"My judgment is he or she speaks for the whole country irrespective of faith of creed when they wrote: 'All terrorists are politely reminded that this is London and whatever you do to us we will drink tea and jolly well carry on',\" he told the house. May called it a \"wonderful tribute\", and said it \"in a very simple way I think has encapsulated everything everybody in this house has said today\". \"What happened yesterday was an appalling atrocity,\" he said. \"Today, we are united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity. \"I express my condolences to the family and friends of PC Keith Palmer, who gave his life yesterday in defence of the public and our democracy – and to the loved ones of those still in a critical condition including the French schoolchildren visiting our capital from Concarneau in Brittany. ... \"I thank all the dedicated NHS staff working to save lives, including those from St Thomas' Hospital who rushed out to help those in need. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. \"It behoves us all not to rush to judgement, but to wait for the police to establish the facts. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred.\" The Scottish National Party's leader in the House of Commons Angus Robertson echoed May and Corbyn's sentiments, saying: \"Today of all days we are reminded that notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none.\" Robertson also paid tribute to police,and the bravery of the Conservative minister who went to the aid of the stabbed officer: \"'We are all hugely grateful to all the police, security staff and first responders who ran towards danger without concern to their safety, and I include in that our colleague the Right Honourable and gallant member for Bournemouth East Tobias Ellwood.\" Parliament is to review its security procedures in an emergency meeting later today in the wake of yesterday's terror attack. Lindsay Hoyle, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of parliament's security committee, told the BBC that he would be hosting a meeting to check if additional measures were required. \"We will be having an emergency meeting,\" he said. \"We'll be getting information, what else needs to be put in place, and we will reflect, not instantly, we've got to take on board what's happened and we will make decisions accordingly. Of course, we've got to look after both houses.\" TV footage on Thursday morning showed new concrete blocks being moved into place around the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the attack. The blocks have already been in place around parts of the parliamentary estate as part of longstanding security measures against vehicle attack. People from 10 different countries caught up in attack, PM says Sky News screengrab Speaking in the Commons, Theresa May revealed some details about those injured in the attack. She said around 40 pedestrians were hurt on Westminster Bridge, including 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish person, one Chinese person, one Italian, one American, and two Greeks. \"We are in close contact with the governments of the countries of all those affected,\" the prime minister said. The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, was in the Commons and Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to him earlier that session, noting his presence was indication of the international support given to the UK in the wake of the attack on parliament. May added that the injured included three police officers who were returning from an event recognising their bravery, two of whom remain in a serious condition. Earlier, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner had said there were 29 people in five hospitals across the country. Seven are in a critical condition. —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:49 AM PM Theresa May says attacker was \"British-born\" and had been previously investigated by MI5 as a \"peripheral\" figure Addressing the House of Commons, prime minister Theresa May confirmed that the attacker, who has still not been publicly identified, was known to MI5 and police and had been a \"peripheral figure\" in a \"historic\" investigation into violent extremism. \"It is still believed that this attacker acted alone and there is no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public,\" she said. \"His identity is known to police and MI5 and when operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. \"What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. Intensive investigations continue.\" May also reiterated earlier lines from the police and defence secretary Michael Fallon that the investigation is focusing on the \"working assumption\" the attacker was \"inspired by Islamist ideology\". \"We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real,\" she said. \"But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not – and will not – be cowed by this threat. \"As acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley has made clear, we are stepping up policing to protect communities across the country and to reassure the public.\" May praised the security and emergency forces for their swift and calm response to the attack, made more remarkable after they had \"lost one of their own\". \"We will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security, and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way,\" she said. \"On behalf of the whole country I want to pay tribute to them for the work they have been doing to reassure the public, treat the injured and bring security back to the streets of our capital city. \"That they have lost one of their own in yesterday's attack only makes their calmness and professionalism all the more remarkable.\" —James Ball and Francis Whittaker Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:43 AM Prime minister reveals nationalities of those wounded and more details on attacker in speech to House of Commons Westminster Bridge survivor: \"The car came out of nowhere\" Carl Court / Getty Images BuzzFeed News has spoken to a survivor who was hit by the attacker's car and flung to the ground on Westminster Bridge, and who said he was unable to describe the Wednesday's events because of the horrific aftermath. The survivor, who asked not to be named, was visiting London from Liverpool and sustained cuts and bruises to his legs – he was with friends who were also hit by the car but survived. He has now been discharged from hospital. \"There was just lot of yelling and commotion,\" he said. \"Then this car came out of nowhere and knocked me and my mates over. The scenes after that I don't really want to describe. They were pretty horrific.\" —Pat Smith Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 10:23 AM Met police have made another arrest in connection to the attack In total eight people have now been arrested, following raids on six properties across the country. The Met has confirmed that these arrests are connected to the attack on Westminster yesterday afternoon. Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 09:47 AM Minute's silence held for those killed in Westminster attack The streets around parliament remained closed on Thursday morning. But inside the building life was already back to a strange sort of normal. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff, and journalists were allowed through police cordons around Westminster to attend parliament. They turned up early for what has been billed as a normal working day, designed to show that the attack would not disrupt British democracy. Security checks were enforced but were no tougher than usual and inside parliament's canteens hundreds of breakfasts were being served. At 9.33am a minute's silence was held, with a packed House of Commons standing together to remember those who lost their lives on Wednesday. They stood, heads bowed, and observed a minute's silence in honour of the lives lost in the attack less than 24 hours earlier. At 9.35am, the doors were opened and members of the press were admitted to the viewing galleries. Speaker John Bercow called the house to order. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, rose to take ministerial questions as scheduled. He began with a short, defiant statement, insisting that Britain wouldn't be cowed by terrorists. \"Such acts of savagery against the innocent can never be justified,\" Fox said. But he quickly moved on to business. Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP, rose to ask the first question. On the verge of tears, he paid tribute to the police who put their lives on the line to defend parliament every day. It was short, sombre. Then he asked the minister a question about Israeli pharmaceutical exports. A group of MPs shuffled out of the house. There was work to be done. But, while MPs attempted to get on with their days in a show of defiance, it was impossible to avoid the events. The main route linking the two main parliamentary buildings passes along the edge of New Palace Yard, the cobbled square where police officer Keith Palmer was killed by an attacker. Thousands of staff have no choice but to walk along this route several times a day, making it impossible to avoid the sight of a crime scene investigation. An ambulance remained on the scene, next to a tent covering the site where Palmer fell. At the carriage gates, where the attacker allegedly broke through, around a dozen police officers were conducting a fingertip search of the ground. And beyond that Parliament Square and Whitehall, usually packed with tourists, protesters, and office workers, was silent. Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of those killed in Wednesday's attack on Westminster, her place of work confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Thursday morning. She was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from school when she was struck by the car that drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Frade taught Spanish at DLD College London, which is just over the river from the houses of parliament. The college confirmed to BuzzFeed News she had died in yesterday's attack. \"We are all deeply shocked and saddened at the news that one of the victims yesterday was a member of our staff, Aysha Frade. All our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with her family. We will be offering every support we can to them as they try to come to terms with their devastating loss,\" Rachel Borland, principal at DLD College London, told BuzzFeed News. \"Aysha worked as a member of our administration team at the college. She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all of us.\" According to Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, Frade was originally from Betanzos in Galicia, northern Spain. Met police revise death toll to four, including attacker Four people, including the attacker, died in the attack on Westminster yesterday, the Metropolitan police confirmed to BuzzFeed News this morning following Commissioner Mark Rowley's earlier statement. Previous statements from New Scotland Yard had said that five people – including the attacker –&nbsp;had been killed in the assault outside the British parliament. Defence secretary Michael Fallon says security services' working assumption is that the attack was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\" Andy Buchanan / AFP / Getty Images Defence secretary Michael Fallon, speaking to the BBC's Today programme, said the \"working assumption\" was that the attack on Westminster was linked to \"Islamic terrorism\". Fallon said the Metropolitan police were making \"urgent\" investigations into the alleged attacker and his known associates – although he declined to state whether there was any indication he acted alone. \"The working assumption is that this is related to Islamic terrorism in some form, but they [the police] don't yet have a full enough picture of this man and his known associates. That work is still going on,\" he said. \"This kind of attack, this lone-wolf attack, using things from daily life, a vehicle, a knife, are much more difficult to forestall, and we are also dealing with a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage but simply wants to kill as many people as possible. \"This is a new element to international terrorism but our forces are working extremely hard. I have every confidence that they will track down his known associates.\" The defence secretary declined to comment on any security changes, but confirmed he would chair a review when it came. He praised the efforts of police and security forces in the aftermath of the attack. \"Although there is intense security around the Palace of Westminster, London is going to work this morning,\" Fallon said. \"Parliament itself will resume at the normal time.\" \"London is getting back to work. London has seen this before and is taking it on the chin,\" he said. \"I do want to reassure you that the police and the security services are doing everything possible to make sure that people can go about their daily life as safely as possible.\" The Metropolitan police confirm seven arrests made last night Mark Rowley, the national lead for counterterrorism policing and the acting deputy commissioner, confirmed that seven arrests had been made, following raids on six properties across the country. He confirmed that four people were killed by the attacker, including two members of the public: a woman in her mid-forties and a man in his fifties. Among the dead were a \"mix of nationalities\", Rowley said, declining to name any of those killed other than 48-year-old police officer Keith Palmer. Rowley said 29 individuals were being treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. Probed on the identity of the alleged attacker, Rowley declined to comment on the individual's nationality and said he would not be naming the suspect – and urged the media to respect that decision. \"It is still our belief that this attacker acted alone, and was inspired by international terrorism,\" Rowley said. Meanwhile, he said London will see an increased police presence, as at least 60 officers continue working on a \"large and complicated crime scene\" outside Westminster. \"We must not allow terrorism to sow discord and fear in our city,\" he said. —Rose Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 07:34 AM Police make ”several\" arrests following raid on property in Birmingham, multiple reports state Carl Court / Getty Images The police have made \"several\" arrests after a raid on a property in Birmingham, the BBC, ITV, and Sky News have reported. The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Press inquiries to West Midlands police were redirected to the Metropolitan police, who declined to comment on the reports when contacted by BuzzFeed News, citing \"operational reasons\". Last night, the surrounding area of a property on Hagley Road in southwest Birmingham was closed for roughly two hours. \"There is an ongoing police operation, no further details are being given at this stage,\" West Midlands police told The Guardian. Separately, it was reported the car – described by witnesses as a Hyundai 4x4 – used to plough through pedestrians in the cycle line on Westminster Bridge was believed to have been rented from near the raided property in Solihull. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner told the Today programme that there were \"indications\" that the car began its journey in Birmingham. Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 22:48 PM Slain officer is identified as death toll rises to 5 people BBC The death toll in Wednesday's Westminster attack rose to five people, including the attacker and a police officer, who was identified as a 15-year veteran. The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Palmer's killer was fatally shot by another police officer. Palmer was a husband and a father, Rowley added. Metro Police Getty Keith Palmer. \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that to happen,\" Rowley said. Three of the victims were members of the public, but not immediately identified. About 40 other people were injured in the attack, some of them seriously, Rowley said. Three of the injured were police officers, two of whom were in serious condition. The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism. Police are working on taking statements from hundreds of people at the scene, reviewing CCTV footage, and seeking information on the attacker and his associates. \"Terrorists have a clear aim: that is to create discord, destruction, and to create fear,\" he said. \"The police stand with all communities in the UK and will take action against anyone who seeks to undermine society, especially where their crimes are motivated by hate.\" —Claudia Koerner Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 21:27 PM Government officials describe crawling on hands and knees to escape attack Carl Court / Getty Images Grant Shapps was walking through from his office to a vote in the House of Commons, making small talk with a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, when he noticed something was amiss at the gates of parliament. At first he dismissed it as another protest and carried on walking. Moments later, he was crawling on his hands and knees for safety, having just witnessed a terror attack. \"I could hear a kerfuffle going on, which is not unusual as there's often protests by the gates,\" the former minister told BuzzFeed News. \"As I'm looking around I hear, 'BAM BAM BAM' – what sounded like four shots to me.\" \"Suddenly, a police officer is standing right where we are, shouting, 'Get down, get down, get back!' We crawled, hands and knees, back to a safety position.\" The former minister was one of hundreds of MPs, parliamentary staff, and journalists who spent several hours in Westminster Abbey as police gathered statements. They began to trickle out of the cathedral at around 8pm. Prime minister Theresa May says attack targeted freedom and democracy BBC Theresa May on Wednesday night said the attack at Westminster was no accident, but rather a direct attack on British democracy. \"The location of this attack was no accident,\" the prime minister said in a speech outside Number 10. \"The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions, and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy, and freedom of speech.\" The single attacker first drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, May said, killing two people and injuring others – including three police officers. He then got out of the vehicle and ran toward parliament with a knife. There, he was confronted by officers. One officer was killed, and the attacker was shot dead by police, May said. The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners. \"And we will all move forward together,\" she said, \"never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us.\" News reports identify wrong man as Westminster attacker A Channel 4 News report misidentified a man associated with a British Muslim terrorist group as the Westminster attacker on its evening broadcast. Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks, was in prison on Wednesday, where he has been since January 2016, sources told BuzzFeed News. Channel 4 News originally identified him as the attacker, who was killed outside British Parliament by police. The attacker's name has not been released. The mistaken report was repeated at the top of the Channel 4+1 news, which began to rebroadcast the earlier report. The channel then went dark as \"conflicting information came to light,\" a Channel 4 News statement said. The first doctor to attend to those injured in the Westminster attack was not on duty at the time, but rushed to the scene when he heard screaming. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior doctor from London who specialises in general practice, told BuzzFeed News he had been attending an interview nearby when the incident happened. \"I heard the screaming so ran to help and the police ran me in,\" he told us. Wijesuriya treated two people, one of whom had been stabbed and another who had been shot. He said he believed one of the patients was the attacker. —Laura Silver Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:30 PM Politicians and staff locked inside buildings in Westminster Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images Hundreds of politicians and their staff are still locked in Westminster Abbey, while police attempt to collect eyewitness testimony and evidence on this afternoon's attack. As the first reports of the attack filtered through, many in parliament seemed unsure how to react with some cafes staying open in Portcullis House. It took several minutes before security staff swept in and cleared the area. Parliamentary staff told BuzzFeed News they were told to stay in their offices for around 90 minutes after the incident, while police swept the premises and checked they were secure. People still on the premises were then led into the ancient Westminster Hall at around 4.30pm – around 90 minutes after the attack. For some staff this involved walking past the scene of the attack on a police officer. Many were then led out through the St Stephen's Entrance into Westminster Abbey, where \"up to 1,000 people\" remain, according to one individual, who said others had been left in Westminster Hall. Police are currently preparing to sort individuals according to how useful they are and then collect information which could help their investigation, including any photographs or eyewitness testimony of an attack that could be clearly seen from many parliamentary offices. —Jim Waterson Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 19:08 PM Home secretary praises bravery of emergency services Daniel Sorabji / AFP / Getty Images Forensics officers at work at the scene.

This is an ongoing incident and the Government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. \"The Government's top priority is the security of its people and I urge everyone to remain calm but to be vigilant and if they see anything they are concerned about they should report it to the police. \"We have the best police, the best security services in the world and we must make sure that we let them get on with doing their job. \"The British people will be united in working together to defeat those who would harm our shared values. \"Values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law.

A readout of the call provided by the White House said: \"President Donald J. Trump spoke today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom to offer his condolences on today's terror attack in London and his praise for the effective response of security forces and first responders. \"He pledged the full cooperation and support of the United States Government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer also spoke about the attack during his daily briefing. \"We obviously condemn today's attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism, and we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation,\" he said. \"The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers. \"The city of London and Her Majesty's government have the full support of the US government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible.\" Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords will sit tomorrow at their normal times. —Alicia Melville-Smith Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 18:34 PM Witnesses on London Eye describe being kept in the air for hours Niklas Halle'n / AFP / Getty Images People are seen inside the pods of the London Eye during the incident Tourists on the London Eye, the landmark ferris wheel not far from parliament on the other side of the Thames, have described how they were kept in their capsules for three hours as the attack unfolded. Jim Hutchinson, from Boston, Massachusetts, and his family were in the last capsule to be boarded before it came to a halt. \"The first thing we noticed was the flashing lights of medics attending to the injured people on the bridge, and then the helicopters,\" he told BuzzFeed News. \"There were three separate groups of injured people on the bridge, at each end and in the middle. It took half an hour before anyone was moved.\" He said that no one in the capsule felt worried for their own safety, although one tourist who could not speak English repeatedly pressed the alarm button to find out why they had stopped. Hutchinson confirmed that police had spoken to everyone on the Eye after they had been allowed off. Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Jim Hutchinson Kody and Taylor Davis, from Utah, told BuzzFeed News they were at the top of the London Eye when it came to a stop. Kody said there was initially no phone service in the capsule and it wasn't until news alerts came on their phones they realised what was going on. \"We eventually managed to call our families and they told us what had happened.\" Taylor said they first had an idea something was wrong when they saw \"a big commotion and lots of stretchers\". Kody and Taylor are due to fly back to the US on Saturday. They were stuck on the London Eye for three hours in total. \"The attack started when a car was driven over Westminster Bridge hitting and injuring a number of members of the public, including three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony,\" Rowley said. He added that police \"we're satisfied at this stage that there looks to be only one attacker but it would be foolish to be over-confident so early on.\" Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:48 PM Photograph appears to show knives at scene of parliament attack This photograph taken from inside the Palace of Westminster by PA's Stefan Rousseau shows an armed officer standing on what appears to be a knife.

I presumed it was an accident and carried on cycling into Parliament Square. \"I didn't think anything else was going on until I saw lots of people gathered near the iron fences, and I went over. That's when I heard the gunshots.\" Haikin, 44, from London, who works in international development, said lots of armed police were on the scene immediately, and he and others were pushed back by the cordon. \"It took a while for what had happened to sink in,\" he said. \"It wasn't scary while it happened, but now after the event, I'm shaken.\" Matthew Champion / BuzzFeed News Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 17:25 PM Met police say counterterrorism investigation is underway Jack Taylor / Getty Images Commander B.J. Harrington Scotland Yard's Commander B.J. Harrington said the Metropolitan police are remaining open-minded as to the motive at this stage, but that a full counterterrorism investigation is already underway. He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police. \"We received a number of different reports, which included a person in a river, a car in collision with pedestrians, and a man armed with a knife,\" he said. \"Officers were already in that location as part of routine policing. Immediately additional officers were sent to the scene, as were firearms officers.\" Harrington confirmed that there were a number of casualties, including police officers, but would not confirm how many or the nature of these injuries. \"Our response will be ongoing for some time and it is important that we gather all possible information and evidence,\" he said. \"Public safety is our top priority and we are reviewing our policing stance across London, and throughout the course of this afternoon there will be additional police and officers deployed across the capital.\" The Met police have asked members of the public to avoid the following areas to allow emergency services to deal with the investigation: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway, and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee later today, a spokeswoman in Downing Street said. Government ministers, senior staff, emergency services, and intelligence services will convene to discuss the attacks.

She is now being dealt with by the emergency services. The Port of London Authority confirmed to BuzzFeed News that just one person was pulled from the water and that the river has now been closed between Vauxhall and Embankment. Earlier, an eyewitness speaking to Sky News said they saw someone fall into the water. He said: \"I was walking across Westminster Bridge and a bus stopped right in front of me and everybody started screaming. And I saw a trainer [shoe] in the road, and I thought somebody must have been hit by a car, and then I saw a body on the other side of the road, and then there was another body further up, and then when I looked over the side of the bridge there was another body in the river. \"I didn't see anything. The first I was aware of it was when people started to scream and people got off the bus looking very shocked. Then there was a lot of confusion and people started dealing with the casualties. I was just trying to wave people back who were coming onto the bridge. \"They were lying face down in the water.\" The BBC later published camera footage of someone falling into the river as a speeding vehicle plows through: The London Ambulance Service Deputy Director of Operations Pauline Cranmer confirmed 10 people were treated by emergency services. \"We can confirm we have treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge and have put a number of hospitals on alert as we continue to respond to this incident,\" he said in a statement. \"We were called at 2.40pm today, with the first ambulance crew arriving within six minutes. \"We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, London's Air Ambulance and our Hazardous Area Response Team. \"We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to ensure patients receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. \"We have declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. \"As we are very busy dealing with this incident, we would ask the public to only call us in a genuine emergency.\" —James Ball Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:42 PM At least one dead and multiple casualties reported One woman has died, according to an anonymous medical source being quoted by multiple media outlets.

There have been separate and unconfirmed reports of up to three \"bodies\" on the bridge, including one \"face down in the water\" that have not been confirmed by police. Eyewitnesses, as well as social media accounts, appear to indicate a number of people were seriously hurt on Westminster Bridge.

Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:31 PM Photo shows police officer pointing gun at suspect on the ground This afternoon's Scottish parliament debate has been suspended in light of the incident in Westminster, but the Holyrood parliament has been strongly criticised for how long it took to make the decision. Holyrood's MSPs were debating a second referendum on independence for over an hour after initial reports of the incident, and first minister Nicola Sturgeon left the chamber just before 3pm. Inside the chamber, outrage grew that the debate was continuing, with Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser requesting that business was suspended but the deputy presiding officer replying that it would be \"business as usual\". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the presiding officer to suspend business for the day, and half a dozen MSPs left the chamber in protest. However, just before 4pm, presiding officer Ken Macintosh decided to suspend the sitting out of respect for \"our sister parliament\" and added there will be time to resume the debate in future. Davidson tweeted: \"Very pleased that sense has won the day & Holyrood has been suspended until we have a better understanding of what is going on in WM.\" Sturgeon added: \"My thoughts are with everyone in and around Westminster caught up in this dreadful incident – and with the brave emergency services.\" —Jamie Ross Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 16:02 PM Some MPs and peers have been evacuated from parliament Many politicians inside parliament have been evacuated by armed police, while some other areas remain in lockdown. MP Anna Soubry tweeted that her colleagues were being \"taken out of the library at gun point\" by counterterrorist police. In a statement, the Metropolitan police said: \"Police are asking people to avoid the following areas: Parliament Square; Whitehall; Westminster Bridge; Lambeth Bridge; Victoria Street up to the junction with Broadway and the Victoria Embankment up to Embankment tube. \"This is to allow the emergency services to deal with the ongoing incident. Police were called at approximately 14:40 hours to reports of an incident in Westminster Bridge, SW1. It is being treated as a firearms incident. \"Officers – including firearms officers – remain on the scene and we are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise.\" A police officer was stabbed at Westminster and the attacker was shot by armed police, the leader of the House of Commons said The leader of the House of Commons, David Lidington, has just spoken in parliament and said a police officer was stabbed. He said: \"First of all, colleagues will have appreciated that events have been moving rapidly and I want to emphasise that the knowledge that I have .... is so far very limited. What I am able to say to the house is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. \"It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police, an air ambulance is currently attending the scene to remove the casualties. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminster but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it would be wrong of me here to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the house security authorities about what is going on. \"I shall endeavour to do the very best I can, both at the despatch box and by communicating with my opposite numbers in other political parties to ensure that members are kept aware of what is happening, but at the moment, the very clear advice from the police and the director of security in the house is that we should remain under suspension and that the chamber should remain in lockdown until we receive advice that it is safe to go back to normal procedures.\" —Marie Le Conte Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 15:10 PM This is the scene outside parliament shortly after the incident Phil Han / BuzzFeed News Parliament Square is being closed and cleared, with an emergency helicopter parked in the middle of the area. Emergency services are attempting to revive one individual lying down on the pavement on Parliament Street, some way away from the entrance to the building. Approximately a dozen armed police ran into the building shortly after 3pm. —Jim Waterson Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 15:03 PM Picture agency images published shortly after the incident showed a heavy armed police presence outside the Palace of Westminster.","title":"Everyone Arrested In Connection With The Westminster Attack Has Now Been

Sauds are Custodians of the top 2 Muslim holy places, Makkah including the Ka'aba, & Medinah, whilst (Jewish?) King Abdullah II is the Custodian of Islam's 3rd holiest site, the Al-Aqsa Mosque - Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem ... So all three of Islam's holiest places are maybe in the custody of Jews? King Abdullah's Hashemite ancestors ruled over the Muslim holy areas of Mecca & Medina over many hundreds of years & through the Ottoman period ... King Abdullah II & his Hashemites may soon become rulers of that part of Arabia once again if the West decides to depose & remove the Sauds King Abdullah II, with his suave 'moderate' image much-promoted by Western media, & his combining Muslim & British 'royal' heritages, is said thus to be a possible new grand caliph of the Muslim world; a figurehead for the New World Order, that may have a new headquarters declared in Jerusalem ... or also in events involving a possible coming of true or false messiahs, Mahdi, anti-Christ etc An estimated 30 percent of ISIS members are of Jordanian nationality ... King Abdullah II oversees semi-secret regular military manoeuvres in Jordon by the Gulf States & the Western powers, exactly in the area where ISIS - Daesh can be covertly supplied thru Jordan Yeah, I read all of that at HenryMakow.com the other day. I like Henry, he understands that Putin is an NWO stooge and his fake fight with the west is a total scam. That sort of thinking will get a person censored on a surprising number of sites. \" Putin is an NWO stooge and his fake fight with the west \" :of course he is :if he wouldn't be , he wouldn't be THERE in russian govt, on a first position.There's a LOT of watering down and disinfo among konspiracy truthers, purposedly ( For the sheeples who believe to be better more aware sheeples, believing in fairy tales like fulton, white brotherhood scams etc. ) Deeper through the rabbit hole !Myself, feel deeply that is better to practise spiritual life and meditation ( best is Vedic ) than indulge in non ending analysys and speculations on the topic what happened in London, 9/11 etc. Read bedlam burning blogger recently, sane view. NO HOAX, REAL people were hurt and died. But , most like body double was used as attacker. MK and this dark stuff. You need to look into some of the crisis actors that where used.Masonic.This lad, Owen Lambert is a political student (as where all his friends). His dad is the Masonic editor of the local newspaper, The Visitor (which took an interest but refused to run my child abuse story)...'causalities taken to a nearby hotel' Why would they take some of the injured past the ambulances and into the Marriott Hotelhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5QWDidkH7MThe one on a stretcher looks like the (terrorist)(Marriott hotels are really unlucky being involved in lots of terrorist incidences)Also so many people that have lost there shoes.Looking at the very poor video of the car passing the busses. The Busses come to a stop quite quickly. It does not look like they travel a busses length before stopping after the car passes in front of each of them. bridge warning sign would stop car driving down bridge.injured before and after sign. The car would have to swerve into and off buss lane. Also most if not all the busses would have cameras. For insurance and safety It's not terrible! Certainly gave me a laugh. I think you are right, they aren't trying very hard. Seems the message could be \"we are going to construct your reality and we don't give a stuff if you know it.\" There’s already enough information here to debunk the official story on the Westminster terrorist attack, in the following thread some more: http://letsrollforums.com//brussels-sprouts-one-year-t32227.html 1) The ridiculous picture of Aysha Frade under a red bus.2) A second picture of the attacker on a stretcher, with a photoshopped face.3) A second (better) picture of the face of Khalid Masood.4) The crash scene of the Hyundai car leaving no damage to the fence (why would the attacker crash?). And a victim in front below the car.5) Doctors on the scene financed with millions from the London Freemasons. The identity of Ms Cristea is in doubt. Look at the photo of her with her alleged boyfriend where she's doing the V sign. She has a very pronounced notch in her chin. Look at the photo of her with red hair and huge red lips and the chin is smooth. Look at the photo where she has her back to the swimming pool looking out on a night time city scape. That girl has a totally different build and arm thickness compared to the super-model-like girl coming out of the sea. Try to find online coverage of the two Romanians in Romanian websites and you will be out of luck. The dearth of stories is a giveaway. There are so many Andreea Cristeas and they all look like super models and are very similar. The main Romanian \"Andreea Cristea\" visible on Facebook is like a Bond Girl with a lavish lifestyle and she works for and is the owner of Medical PR. She has left clues to the attack - by way of a Tissot watch with the time the \"Hero\" (indicated by a tiny wristband and a badge saying Hero) did his stuff outside Westminster is timed at 2:52pm - 12 minutes after the attack went down. You cannot find the two Romanians in Facebook that appear in the Sun article. ~ TM \"Three boys from St Joseph’s school in Brittany, in London on a visit, were seriously injured when the British Muslim convert Khalid Masood ploughed into a crowd last Wednesday. A former pupil from the same school was murdered during the Bataclan attack in Paris.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfuXc36kMsIPhotographs from the event provided by two photographers with top connections.https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/toby-melvillehttp://stefanrousseau.com/about-contact Took them a while to come up with this ......http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4371770/Vile-video-shows-knife-expert-penetrating-stab-vest.html Many people (not least on here) questioned how the police officer was stabbed to death in seconds even though all police wear stab vests, so here's the Daily Mail and their attempt at damage limitation for the sheeple I’ve been investigating this false flag attack since March 23; my research is finished: http://letsrollforums.com//brussels-sprouts-one-year-t32227p5.html First I will introduce “independent” star witness Graham Neale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39VJfKdhSR8 Since August 2016 Graham Neale is copywriter and editor for Aflatoun International; an international NGO affiliated with the United Nations that specialises in teaching children and young people about their responsibilities (to become a good slave?) and “limited” resources (the problem of overpopulation...): https://himself.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/progressivism-re-education-via-video-game-for-teens-aflateen-digital-demonics-aflatoun/ Aflatoun was launched in 2005 by Princess (now Queen) Maxima of the Netherlands.Aflatoun is even promoted by the Brookings Institute: https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FINAL-Aflatoun-Case-Study.pdf From 2012 – 2015 Neale was chairman for the Green Liberal Democrats, lobbying for a sustainable policy framework (the problem of overpopulation...): https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahamnealepublic/Since April 2016 Graham Neale is producer for the Italian state network RAI Uno housed in the Millbank towerThe Millbank tower is interesting because from here the video of the see-through Hyundai car racing over Westminster Bridge was shot. The Reuben brothers (David and Simon), who own the Millbank tower, have financed a campaign of Boris Johnson (who was in the infamous Bullingdon club with Nat Rothschild and David Cameron).The Millbank tower is also home to the Henry Jackson Society (a think tank), whose members include MP’s, former heads of British intelligence agencies, CFR, Homeland security, Israel, NATO, and former CIA-director James Woolsey. The Henry Jackson Society is one of those organisations that push for a strong military to fight the “War on terror”.Dr. Alan Mendoza, founder and executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, quickly proclaimed that the Westminster attack follows “the modus operandi of ISIS-related attacks”.The terrorist was part of a “vast network” of British-based Islamists.According to “research” by the Henry Jackson Society “anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people” are so “dangerous” that they require “active surveillance”: http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/03/23/mendoza-westminster-attacks-modus-operandi-islamic-state-related-attacks/ There are even connections with the “hero MP” Tobias Ellwood, who was appointed to the Queen’s Privy Council for his heroic efforts to save “hero” cop Keith Palmer.In 2010, Ellwood was involved in a discussion with the Henry Jackson Society about terrorism: http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2010/07/22/the-dynamics-of-terrorism-in-the-afpak-conflict/Ellwood is also listed as co-writer for a paper for the Henry Jackson Society in 2013: http://henryjacksonsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Blue-light-Report_LR.pdf Just 4 weeks before the Westminster “terror attack” (on 21 February 2017), Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institute was invited by the Henry Jackson Society to come over from the USA to discuss urgent matters.They claim it was about Donald Trump’s influence on the “international world order”: http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2017/02/21/event-summary-the-trump-administration-and-international-relations/ So there you have it, my conclusion is that 29 days before 22 March, the final details for this false flag attack were figured out by the Brookings Institute and the Henry Jackson Society.The trail of Aflatoun International leads directly to the Dutch Royal crime family.And “independent” star witness Radoslaw Sikorksi was present at the 2016 Bilderberg meeting... The old name for the Tower card was \"Le maison Dieu\" or the House of God. The image is of a tower being hit by lightning and two figures are shown falling. Tarot cards can be interpreted positively or hegatively depending on the cards around them or if they are the right way up or inverted. Some say the tower is the Tower of Bavel (Babylon) which is traditionally considered to have been destroyed by God for daring to aspire to the heights of heaven. So the lesson is that going against the will of God/Goddess/Nature/Tao brings destruction whether due to hubris or stupidity. That's the positive meaning. The negative reading would suggest the person is ignoring this message and continuing to believe themself as superhuman. Some say the figures are male and female and the male falls while the female glides. This represents the contrasting natures of ego/will and subconscious/acceptance for male and female respectively, and suggests it is better to go with the Tao/flow rather than try to resist or fight the inevitable. In the Golden Dawn deck there is an illustration of the Qliphoth to the left of the tower and the Tree of Life on the right. In the Book of Thoth the All-Seeing Eye features at the top of the card and a fire-breathing serpent appears at the bottom. The card is ruled by Scorpio with loys of reds, oranges and flame yellows. The Tower is Atu or Trump no. 16. For synchronicity with topic of this article ( and as I've just finished reading the book and am tarot reader) see book below. WARNING - not for the easily upset, there are some really gruesome passages. There seems to be a lot of creepy occult imagery concealed in much of Anglo-zionist media and entertainment industry.I Used to think this was all so much tin-foil hat stuff in my less enlightened days but now i keep an open mind. The burning tower or tower struck by lightning is an important card of the Tarot deck a form of divination replete with Kabbalistic symbolism. Amongst other things it foretells Physical disaster, upheaval, revolutionary change. On some decks it is surmounted by a falling crown symbolising among other things the fall of kings, materialistic thought etc. On the Rider-Waite deck small flames representing the Hebrew letter Yod are depicted. Yod represents the divine spark or potential God within man which the Kabbalists hope to liberate ( Ye Shall be as Gods ). Interesting to see the numerous references to Crowns, Reigns, triangles, eyes, Red bracelets in the current r&b, Rap, Hip-Hop \" culture\" Could they be trying to tell us that the work is near completion? NWO, New Age, Fabian Utopia, Open Conspiracy Jewish Messianic Age. Whatever the moniker it smells evil and you can be sure there is Money behind it and its been a long time in the making. On the other hand perhaps its all just one big CIA PsyOp. Just a thought regarding the Magician card depicted on The Economist cover. In this depiction there is a factory and conveyer belt on the magician's table. This is churning out housing units. Could there be a connection with the Grenfell Fire and the very rapid condemnation of a large number of High rises in London?( normally reports would have been commissioned over months) Could it be \" foretelling \" a strategy of mass construction to boost a flagging economy whilst simultaneously re- structuring the social composition of Electoral Wards? Any Thoughts? The Magician manipulates all four tarot suit symbols and adopts a Baphomet pose with one hand pointing up and the other pointing down - as above so below - signifying connecting the spiritual with the material. Or this could be understood as the process of making ideas manifest, so your explanation makes a lot of sense. This whole scam would constitute a typical magician's trick - everyone watches the fire while the real action is elsewhere. Listening to the \" Ministry Of Truth \" on the radio today they were saying samples from 75 high rises have been sent to the Building Standards laboratory for analysis. This suggests pre-planning to me akin to the \" Je Suis Charlie \" placards i.e too quickly on the heels of the actual event. Perhaps this housing will be used to house the new commonwealth Gastarbeiter needed post Brexit. Poor souls they aren't to blame they just want a living wage. It seems to me our Government however are intent on destroying what is left of British culture outside of obesity, illiteracy, tattoos and the conspicuous consumption of crap in pursuit of some vision of Britain a la Rhodes-Milner. Wish I had emigrated in my Youth. Anonymous @ 04:47, interesting point regarding Baphomet. During Trump's Inaugoral swearing-in ceremony, I noticed for the first time how the left hand on the Bible and right hand raised is precisely the Baphomet gesture (as above ,so below). And of course it is the same gesture used to swear an oath in court.I never saw it before even though it was in plain sight! For those interested in Baphomet symbolism I would suggest taking a look at the highly engaging and entertaining \"In Search of Black Assassins\" blog. While I don't always agree with everything on this site, I've spent many hours lost in the rich mix of occult exposes of celebrities and people of power. This site is funny and scary in equal measure and well worth visiting. Strange how so many Mormons crop up as victims in the \"attacks\". Mormons are of course Zionists who apparently used to believe Black skin was the \" Mark Of Cain \", but no longer do. Absolutely remarkable coincidence that a terror drill involving a body being thrown into the Thames is replicated in real life several days later (Ms Cristea). Also remarkable that two unarmed Tory MPs Tobias Elwood and Ben Wallace, both with high level military connections emerge to grapple with crazed \" Muslim covert\". Probably just coincidence. I used to live adjacent to the regional office of the Church of Latter Day Saints and their young missionaries would often call at our house. They were mostly intelligent well-spoken young people but a few seemed pretty vacant and (looking back with more knowledge) possible mind kontrol candidates. So in response to the interesting comment above, I agree, it probably was more than a coincidence, which of course is what you ironically suggest. This article is about false flags. Can I ask the community what ppl think about the Internet show, False Flag Weekly News? The show goes out weekly on No LIes Radio and is hosted by Prof Anthony Hall of Lethbridge Uni, Canada and editor of the International Herald Tribune, and Dr Kevin Barrett, senior editor at Veterans Today and author of various books and articles about 9/11, Charlie Hebdo and other \"truther\" works. I've been watching for a while now and several things are making me feel uneasy. I'll give three example; Their admiration for the Islamic Republic of Iran for a start. The men are regualrly on PressTV and attend lots of conferences in Iran This site and others have provided plenty of evidence that the Iranian leadership have very suspicious connections to western powers and Israel. Yet the guys never mention that. As far as I know from talking to Iranians, the religious goons killed all the real student revolutionaries and subverted the revolution against the Shah. On Friday they claimed that Qatar supports \"democratic Islamic government\". Yet according to wikipedia, \"Qatar is a hereditary monarchy and its head of state is Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar They claim they are being attacked by B'nai B'rith, and seem to expose ZioNazi bad deeds, yet something doesn't feel right to me. No mention of historical links to SAS, MI5/6, Special Branch or police. Yet includes this claim, \"... al-Muhajiroun was allowed to recruit in towns across the UK for years, largely unfettered by the state ...\"","title":"Aangirfan: LONDON ATTACK - FALSE FLAG - PART

An eyewitness has told Sky News he saw a body \"face down\" in the Thames. Witnesses said people either jumped or were knocked over the side of the bridge as the car mounted the pavement and struck a number of pedestrians. A spokesman for the Port of London Authority, which looks after safety on the river, said a female member of the public had been recovered from the water near Westminster bridge after she \"fell\" or \"jumped\" in. \"A female member of the public was recovered alive from the water, but with serious injuries. She has been brought ashore and is undergoing urgent medical treatment. The working assumption is that she fell or jumped from the bridge.\" “I came out of Westminster Tube at about 2:45pm when police were locking down the tube, ushering people out away from Parliament. I was ushered onto Westminster Bridge, and then I looked across the bridge, onto the west pavement,” he recalled. “For the whole length of the bridge, from south to north, there were people lying on the ground and I was then told that a car had driven from the south end all the way up the pavement to the north end of the bridge. I counted at least eight people clearly injured on the ground.” Incident in #Westminster: We are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise Another witness described seeing a middle-aged man carrying a knife running towards the Palace of Westminster. Kamal Alam, a Syrian military analyst whose office isn’t far from where the attack took place, also spoke with RT. “I thought it’s just some kind of school drill, but within a few seconds heard what sounded like gunshots and a lot of screaming, and all of a sudden there [were] dozens of armed policemen telling everyone to run away from Parliament Square and Westminster Tube Station,” he said. Jayne Wilkinson told Sky News: \"We were taking photos of Big Ben and we saw all the people running towards us, and then there was an Asian guy in about his 40s carrying a knife about seven or eight inches long. \"And then there were three shots fired, and then we crossed the road and looked over. The man was on the floor with blood. \"He had a lightweight jacket on, dark trousers and a shirt. \"He was running through those gates, towards parliament, and the police were chasing him.\" Impossible to be sure from here, but judging by the lack of resuscitation efforts it doesn't look good for either police officer or attacker According to Doug Weeks, terrorism expert at London Metropolitan University, the attack, while softened by the high security presence in the area, could have been far bloodier. “Well certainly within the Parliament compound itself, that is by far one of the most secure areas within London. There are numerous police officers and other security personnel that work in that area as well as around that area, thus it’s not surprising that the police have a very rapid response to this incident,” Weeks told RT. Following the attack, Number 10 said Prime Minister Theresa May was safe. The spokesman declined to say where May was when the attack took place. It is understood, however, she was rushed to a car 40 yards from the gates outside parliament where the shots were fired minutes after the attack. She was ushered by at least eight armed undercover police, some with their firearms drawn. The leader of the House of Commons David Lidington said the alleged assailant was shot by armed police \"inside the parliament perimeter.\" Terror attack outside U.K. Parliament. 2 men down on road.

An air ambulance landed in Parliament Square shortly after the incident. London Ambulance Service deputy director of operations Pauline Cranmer said it has \"declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible.\" The US State Department said it was closely following the \"concerning situation\" in the UK. \"The Department of Homeland Security stands in solidarity alongside our friends in the United Kingdom in condemning the terrible attack at Parliament today.

We relay advice on discussing upsetting and frightening events with pupils, including terrorist attacks. We also link to another of our articles with guidance on supporting pupils who have experienced traumatic events. Article tools Share this page with a colleague Please note: only members of The Key will be able to access the article Tips for parents The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has published tips for parents on how to talk to children about terrorism. When speaking to children, parents should avoid \"complicated, worrying explanations\" as they may struggle to process information and may be left feeling more frightened and confused. It is acceptable to agree with children that attacks are frightening and sad, and that you can't stop them. In addition, the guidance says that it is important to address victimisation following a terrorist attack as some children may feel targeted because of their faith or background. Discussing incidents and terrorism in lessons The PSHE Association has developed guidance for primary and secondary schools on discussing unforeseen events. Primary The guidance for the primary phase offers practical tips for discussing a terrorist attack and structuring questioning. It says: To ignore, dismiss, or not answer these questions, or to pretend that nothing has happened, can be counterproductive. It is important to answer children’s questions honestly and in an age-appropriate way, in order to allay possible fears, but also to ensure that children are clear about separating basic facts about an event from speculation, rumour or untruths. Further practical suggestions cover: Offering reassurance Clarifying facts Encouraging community cohesion You can download the guidance document from the webpage below, under the subheading 'Attachments'. Secondary For secondary schools, the PSHE Association has published a framework that identifies the importance of deconstructing events, identifying the difference between factual information, speculation and rumour. It also provides examples of questions that can be used to explore initial feelings. These include: How do we feel about what has happened? How do other people appear to be feeling – locally or nationally – through the media? Are these feelings appropriate? Are these events causing us (or encouraging us) to feel differently about a group of people or community Are we in danger of 'generalising' the actions of a few to a larger group or community? What activities can we undertake to prevent terrorist attacks from dividing our community? You can download the framework from the webpage below, under the subheading 'Attachments'. Factors to consider when speaking to children We spoke to 3 of our associate education experts, Jeremy Bird, Nina Siddall-Ward and Jenny Moss, about what factors schools should consider when speaking to children. We outline these factors below. School context Jeremy advised that schools consider the cultural background of the school community and the potential risk of radicalisation before speaking to children. Both Jeremy and Nina emphasised the importance of communicating to parents and pupils that the school is not demonising or attacking any particular faith or culture when discussing these events. Age and maturity of pupils Nina and Jeremy explained that teachers may differentiate the way they approach speaking to pupils depending on their age and/or emotional maturity. Jeremy explained that regardless of pupils' age, teachers should be willing to listen to pupils' concerns and reassure pupils about their safety. Nina suggested that when speaking to younger pupils, teachers may want to: When speaking to younger pupils, teachers may want to emphasise the importance of staying close to parents and listening to instructions Emphasise the importance of staying close to parents and listening to instructions Help children to understand who their 'safe' adults are and who they should speak to if they do not feel safe Discuss the importance of rules and making the right choices, explaining that people who commit violence are making bad choices With older pupils, Nina and Jeremy suggested that teachers may want to Stress the importance of spiritual, moral, social and cultural (SMSC) education and British values, particularly tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs and the rule of law Special educational needs Jenny said that for pupils with special educational needs (SEN), it will be important to ensure that the vocabulary you use when speaking to them is “at a developmentally appropriate level”. For example, the level of understanding of a 16 year old with SEN who functions at the level of a 7 year old may be similar to that of primary-aged children without SEN. She advised that the 3 points suggested by Winston's Wish for adults to follow in discussions with children, which we relay above, are also likely to be appropriate for pupils with SEN, and added that staff could: Provide information in “bite-size chunks” Give pupils a safe environment in which to speak and ask questions Ensure they answer pupils' questions honestly Jenny also said that some children with SEN may be on the autistic spectrum, and may therefore tend to “think in black and white”. It is therefore important to encourage them to be open-minded, as well as approaching the subject in a way which ensures they are not fearful of everybody. Informing parents Nina also advised that schools should notify parents before talking to pupils as some parents may not want the school to speak to their child about these incidents. Additionally, by informing parents beforehand they can be more prepared if pupils ask any questions at home.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/7-april/news/uk/candle-lit-tribute-to-those-hurt-in-westminster","text":"Candle-lit Abbey tribute to those killed in Westminster terror attack Hope, not despair: the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry in Westminster Abbey on Wednesday Hope, not despair: the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry in Westminster Abbey on Wednesday HUNDREDS of candles were lit in Westminster Abbey on Wednesday as London’s political and faith leaders gathered for a service of hope — 14 days after five people were killed and 50 injured in a terrorist attack just a stone’s throw away across Parliament Square. “Together let us affirm our shared humanity and our resolve to bring light and life to all,” the Dean of Westminster, the Very Revd John Hall, said, as candles held by the congregation were lit one by one along the rows of national dignitaries, police officers, paramedics, and relatives of those killed. The service was sombre but intended to inspire, its organisers conscious that it was taking place just a fortnight after Khalid Masood mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and knifed PC Keith Palmer in the grounds of the Palace of Westminster (News, 24 March). On Friday morning it was confirmed that a fourth person, Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, had died from her injuries suffered after being hit by Mr Masood's car on the bridge. Ms Cristea was knocked into the River Thames, while her boyfriend, Andrei Burnaz — who had been planning to propose to Ms Cristea during their holiday in Britain — suffered a broken foot. The families of PC Palmer and those who died on the bridge through the terrorist’s actions had lost the most, the Dean said, while everyone had been left “bewildered and disturbed”. Quoting John Donne, the Dean reminded the Abbey: “No man is an island, entire of itself”; because of this “any man’s death diminishes me”. Indeed, the attack was not just against London but against the world, he said. Those killed and injured included visitors from countries as far afield as South Korea, Australia, and the United States. Mr Masood’s deadly assault on Westminster defied sense, the Dean said. “What could possibly motivate a man to drive fast at people he had never met, against whom he had no personal grudge, no reason to hate them, and then run at the gates of the Palace of Westminster to cause another death?” After his address ended, the haunting melody of a cellist, playing a traditional Catalan melody in the nave, echoed around the Abbey. The Old Testament reading, from the book of Jeremiah, pursued the theme of lament: “A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children . . . because they are no more.” But the second reading, the parable of the Good Samaritan, was chosen as a direct challenge to those who sought to drive a wedge between those of different faiths who lived in London, just as it originally tackled the enmity between Jews and their brethren in Samaria, the Dean explained. It was read by the Duke of Cambridge, who was joined at the service by his wife and Prince Harry. “That enmity is no bar to the Samaritan doing a good deed for the Jew,” Dean Hall said. “The people who should have been the first responders, the ones who walked past quickly, were of the same faith and nationality as the injured man. But they did nothing.” Perhaps they feared the man was dead and thus ceremonially unclean, the Dean suggested; but “Jesus condemns them — they have failed the test of compassion and love, the test of mercy, which Jesus rates far more highly than adherence to narrow religious conventions.” Christ was calling people to reach out in “brotherly and sisterly love” to those of other faiths and backgrounds, the Dean said. He recalled the example of the Archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster, who joined the Chief Rabbi and leading Sunni and Shia Muslim imams to proclaim a mutual respect and abhorrence for violence outside the Abbey in the days after the attack (News, 31 March). “We stand together; just as in this service the world faiths are represented and will pray together — above all for the gift of hope,” the Dean concluded. Prayers were said by faith representatives, including a Commander of the Metropolitan Police, Mak Chishty, a Muslim, and Constable Jaskaran Garcha, a Sikh. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, concluded the time of prayer by quoting the prayer ascribed to St Francis of Assisi: “Lord, make us channels of your peace. . . Where there is hatred let us bring your love. . . . Where there is despair in life, let us bring hope. Where there is darkness, only light.”","title":"Candle-lit Abbey tribute to those killed in Westminster terror

{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/uk/382021-terrorism-sadiq-khan-trump/","text":"London Mayor Sadiq Khan has found himself embroiled in a row with Donald Trump’s son, who used the attack on parliament to condemn comments made by the mayor last year that terrorist attacks are “part and parcel of living in a big city.” Donald Trump Jr took to Twitter to slam the mayor’s comments, made during an interview to the Evening Standard back in September 2016. You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO “I want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked,” Khan had added in the interview, according to the Independent. The mayor, however, told BBC’s Radio 4 Today program on Thursday morning that he would not respond to Trump’s tweets. “What I will say about this is the threat level in London and our country remains the same: it’s severe.“That means according to experts an attack is highly likely. The commissioner who just retired said last year that as far as an attack was concerned it’s a question of when not if. “Thankfully the police and the security services and the emergency services practice for such incidents. One I’m afraid has happened yesterday,” Khan said. Trump Jr’s remarks were not well-received in Britain. MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, hit out at Trump Jr for exploiting the London terrorist attack to criticize the mayor. @DonaldJTrumpJr You use a terrorist attack on our city to attack London's Mayor for your own political gain. You're a disgrace. Criticism of Khan Khan, however, has faced other accusations of falling short in the way he dealt with the crisis following the assault on Parliament on Wednesday that killed four and left 40 injured. Khan made a statement at 4:26pm, almost two hours after the attack, saying: “There has been a serious incident near to Parliament Square this afternoon which is being treated as a terrorist attack until the police know otherwise.“I have spoken to the Acting Commissioner. The Metropolitan Police Service is dealing with the incident and an urgent investigation is underway.“My thoughts are with those affected and their families.” Khan also thanked the police and emergency services for their “tremendous bravery” and “hard work” to protect London. Some of the public, however, took to social media to question why he failed to say anything about the attack earlier, with some calling his silence “deafening.” Others criticized him for making \"zero difference\". Point of #sadiqkahn making a statement? Why does he need to be in contact with counter terrorism cops? He is making zero difference. Khan released another statement later on Wednesday evening saying: “We stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life.“We always have, and we always will. Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism,” he said.","title":"London Mayor Sadiq Khan rows with Donald Trump Jr following Westminster terrorist attack — RT UK

He would not comment on the identity of the attacker, but said police were working on the assumption that the attack was \"Islamist-related terrorism\". Hundreds of officers are investigating the attack, and the investigation is working at a \"very fast pace\", Mr Rowley said. 'Catastrophic' injuries among casualties from Westminster Bridge Video aired by the BBC showed a woman falling off Westminster Bridge into the River Thames. It was unclear whether she jumped in or was hit, but the BBC reported she was later pulled from the river and taken to hospital. A doctor who treated the wounded from the bridge said some had \"catastrophic\" injuries. Three French schoolchildren aged 15 or 16 were among those injured in the attack, French officials said. Others injured on the bridge included three police officers, two Romanian tourists and five South Korean visitors. The Australian permanent resident who was injured had her foot run over by the car and is now recovering in hospital. Attorney-General George Brandis said she had been offered consular assistance. US President Donald Trump said he had spoken with Ms May to offer his condolences, and pledged the \"full cooperation and support\" of the US Government in responding to the attack. London Mayor Sadiq Khan released a statement saying his thoughts were with those affected and their families, and thanking the police and emergency services who show \"tremendous bravery in exceptionally difficult circumstances\". On Westminster Bridge, witness Steve Voake told the ABC: \"Nobody had any idea what was going on so we just started trying to get everybody off the bridge. \"I was walking across the bridge and suddenly a bus stopped and people started screaming. \"There were a couple of bodies on the other side of the bridge and then the side I was on there was a body in the water with blood around it and then quite quickly a police launch came up and then there was a medic motorcycle.\"","title":"London attack: At least four dead, 40 injured after terrorist targets Westminster Bridge, Houses of

{"originalUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39377883?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","text":"Police are appealing for information as they try to establish whether Westminster attacker Khalid Masood acted alone or was directed by others. They said the investigation would focus on Masood's \"motivation, preparation and his associates\". His fourth victim has been named as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Clapham, south London - one of three people killed by Masood's car on Westminster Bridge. Police have now released seven of the 11 people arrested since Wednesday. The Metropolitan Police said they had been released \"with no further police action\". Six of those had been arrested in Hockley, Birmingham, on Thursday morning and one had been arrested in Manchester. A 32-year-old woman, who was arrested in Manchester, has been released on bail until late March. A 39-year-old woman, from east London, had already been released on bail until late March. Those still in custody are: A 58-year-old man from Birmingham A 27-year-old man from Birmingham Earlier, in appealing for information from the public, Mark Rowley, of the Metropolitan Police, said they would investigate whether Masood \"acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda, or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him\". The assistant deputy commissioner added: \"There might be people out there who did have concerns about Masood but did not feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing those concerns to us.\" Image copyrightTravis FrainImage caption Prince Charles has visited some of the injured at King's College Hospital, including Travis Frain Fifty people were injured in Wednesday's attack, with 31 receiving hospital treatment. Two are in a critical condition, and one has life-threatening injuries. The injured include Andreea Cristea, who had an operation for a blood clot on her brain after Masood's car hit her on Westminster Bridge and knocked her into the River Thames. Two officers remain in hospital with \"very significant\" injuries, one of whom has been identified as PC Kristofer Aves. PC Keith Palmer, 48, died on Wednesday after being stabbed by Masood. On Friday evening it was announced that Tobias Ellwood, the MP who battled to save the life of PC Palmer, and security minister Ben Wallace have been appointed to the Privy Council - the historic group that advises monarchs - in recognition of their responses to the attack. Of those killed on Westminster Bridge, Aysha Frade, a teacher in her 40s, and US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, died on Wednesday, while Mr Rhodes, a retired window cleaner, died on Thursday evening when his life support machine was turned off. Masood, 52, had driven his car onto the pavement and into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, before crashing the vehicle into railings and running into the grounds of Parliament. He was armed with a knife and stabbed PC Palmer, before being shot dead by police. The Metropolitan Police said Masood, who had a number of previous convictions but none for terrorism, had used a number of aliases. Registered as Adrian Russell Elms, in Dartford, Kent, at birth, Masood was also known as Adrian Russell Ajao in childhood.","title":"London attack: Police appeal for information on Khalid Masood - BBC

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/this-is-the-man-behind-the-westminster-attack?utm_term=.tmqKrLaRZ","text":"Khalid Masood, the man who attacked parliament this week, was born Adrian Elms in Dartford, Kent, on Christmas Day in 1964. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. Masood had been investigated “some years ago” as part of an investigation into violent extremism, prime minister Theresa May told MPs on Thursday. But despite a history of violent criminal offences he was only ever seen as \"peripheral\" in historical terror investigations. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. A former intelligence official told BuzzFeed News: \"The service had him as an SOI [subject of interest] a few years ago but think he didn't meet the threshold for investigation so was not investigated further.\" They added: \"My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he's acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint.\" Metropolitan police Khalid Masood The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \"Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.” Masood’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. In 2000, while living in the village of Northiam, Sussex, Masood, still known then as Elms, was convicted for slashing a man’s face after an argument in a pub. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott. This was a long time ago. I remember Elms being a bit of a troubled character.” Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News The block of flats where Masood lived most recently in Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham. A next-door neighbour who gave her name as Iwona, 45, said he had lived there for seven months. \"I am really surprised, I cannot believe it, I cannot believe it,” she told BuzzFeed News. “As I said, when I saw him I couldn't even think someone could do something like this. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. “Sometimes in the afternoon I saw him taking care of the garden, washing the car, and he was very calm.\" Iwona described the woman he lived with there as being in her thirties and said she wore \"Islamic clothing\". The neighbour said she hadn't seen Masood for a few months and that he just \"took a van and went\". Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. \"The family moved quickly and took their things out of the garage,\" Iwona said. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News Masood's neighbour Iwona at her flat in Quayside, Birmingham. Another neighbour, who gave her name as Sam, said: “He moved out in December and I never really spoke to him. I didn't know his name before. “He had a little boy who was 5 years old. There was a woman – I didn't know if it was his wife or daughter. We’d just say hello in the street.” It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Department for Education said Masood never held qualified status as a teacher, but according to The Sun newspaper he claimed on his CV to have an economics degree and to be a “senior English teacher” at a TEFL college in Luton in 2009. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, the prime minister confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”. Echoing police, she said the “working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology”. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. “He was just like any other guest who checks into the hotel,\" he said. \"We had a brief conversation about where he came from in Birmingham. “He talked about his family, his mum, his dad, his wife. He said his dad was ill and his mum was upset.” Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. Huntleys School website “I am really, really shocked. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. The picture of us in the football team was after we did a 24-hour sponsored football match to raise money for the sports hall,” said Stuart Knight, who went to school with Masood, to TheGuardian. “We would have been about 14 years old. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/25/westminster-attack-car-hire-firms-urged-tell-police-suspicious-customers-khalid-masood","text":"Professor Anthony Glees, from the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies programme at the University of Buckingham, has called for staff from car hire companies to tell the police of any concerns they have about people renting vehicles. Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson used on Westminster Bridge from Enterprise car rentals in Spring Hill, Birmingham. “I would say that if… somebody [renting out] a car may suspect the motives of the person hiring the car, that should be recorded and passed on… to the police. Security policy is a dial, not a switch. When times are tough, you turn the dial up and I would say times are tough at moment. “What are the telltale signs? I think people hiring cars should be asked to give a purpose, so that people can give a judgment. What was the purpose of this man hiring a car?” The vehicles used in some of the most recent high-profile terror attacks are linked in that none of them have been owned by the attackers who used them. In the Nice attack, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel used a lorry he had rented from a local company, while in the Berlin attack last December, 12 people died when Anis Amri ploughed a hijacked lorry into a Christmas market. This link has given rise to theories that the use of vehicles not owned by the perpetrators is a deliberate tactic. “If you compare this attack to the Nice attack or the Berlin attack, on all three occasions, the vehicles used did not belong to the attacker. The Nice lorry was rented, the Berlin lorry was hijacked. And the car used [in London] was hired. It raises the question of whether this is a modus operandi, if terrorists are told, in using a car as a weapon, ‘you should not use your own car’,” said Glees. “It is quite an important clue. If you are going into a jihad operation, you almost certainly expect you are going to die – why wouldn’t you use your own vehicle? So hiring a car, hijacking a car, would seem to be part of a plan. In that context at the moment, it would make very good security sense to put car hire companies on the alert and to enable data to be shared. “We know that people copy other people and we have to be on the alert. And one of the ways we could be on the alert is asking a few questions about why people are hiring cars – for what purpose?” The chief executive of British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), the trade body which represents the majority of car hire companies, said members can use databases to identify “problem renters”. “The car rental industry takes security very seriously. We will continue to work closely with police to ensure that our members are kept abreast of latest threats or security concerns,” said Gerry Keaney. A spokesman for the organisation declined to comment on what level of cooperation there was between companies and the police. “I can’t comment on the current procedures that are in place,” he said. An industry database called Risc contains the details of drivers who have used fake IDs or damaged vehicles. This, however, would not necessarily work to prevent the hiring of a vehicle for criminal use. “As we saw during the week, the people who intend to use hire vehicles either for dishonest, illegal or appalling purposes will often produce valid credentials,” said the spokesperson. In the United States, the FBI and the Department of Justice have distributed flyers to local businesses highlighting potential suspicious activities. People working in vehicle rental businesses have been told to be aware of those who have a reluctance to provide personal information, who use cash for a large transaction or who question the exact dimensions or fuel capacity of a car.","title":"Westminster attack: car hire firms urged to tell police about suspicious customers | UK news | The

{"originalUrl":"http://www.santjoel.com/2017/03/tech-firms-privacy-protections.html#.WNyhxwiEPdo.twitter","text":"Thursday, 30 March 2017 Tech firms privacy protections questioned after Westminster attack Google, Twitter and Facebook will be asked later to explain their positions on extremist content on their platforms and on government access to encrypted communications of the public. After the Westminster attack, Amber Rudd said police and intelligence agencies need access to messages sent on WhatsApp and other encrypted services like Apple's iMessage and Telegram. Technology companies have resisted the move, saying it would make millions of users less safe online. Speaking to Sky News, the Home Secretary said: \"Just to be clear - all I am trying to have potential access to is for the intelligence services, under warrant from the Home Secretary, to be able to find out where and how the terrorists are talking to each other. \"That's completely different to what is sometimes being suggested in terms of end-to-end encryption - I don't want to do that, I recognize the importance of cyber security, a secure cyber environment is incredibly important for our economy and our country. \"But should the terrorists have somewhere safe to hide? No, I don't think they should and I'm talking to organisations to find out what else they can do to help us find a solution to this.\" It is unclear what distinction the Home Secretary is drawing between different types of encryption. Technology experts say that a partial or selective weakening of encryption on an app is impossible. Antony Walker, deputy CEO of TechUK, a trade association for tech organisations, told Sky News: \"End-to-end encryption is incredibly important to the UK's national security. \"The question is then: what role does it play in terms of these messaging services? \"What is very clear is that end-to-end encryption is binary: you either have it or you don't. \"There's no real way you can have a back door into these services that won't eventually become an open door to criminals and terrorists and hostile states.\" In fact, the Government already has the legal power to compel technology companies to hand over unencrypted data, as part of the Investigatory Powers Act, or so-called Snoopers' Charter, passed last year. So far, this power remains untested. Lord Carlile QC, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Sky News: \"The Government has little appetite for either going to court against technology companies or enlarging the legal provisions. \"And they're right about that. It is to be hoped that technology companies can be persuaded they should co-operate fully. \"If they don't of course, we'll have to think again.\" On Wednesday, the acting head of Scotland Yard, Craig Mackey, said the Westminster attack must act as a \"wake up\" call for tech companies.","title":"Welcome to Sant Joel's Blog: Tech firms privacy protections questioned after Westminster

{"originalUrl":"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/westminster-bridge-car-attack-history-vehicle-weapon-terror-1613148","text":"There is a grim history of the use of vehicles as deadly weapons by terrorists. It is often a tool of Palestinian militants because vehicles can quickly cause mass injuries and are difficult for security services to stop. Isis has instructed its supporters across the world to carry out terror attacks with vehicles. Here are some of the most high-profile terror attacks with vehicles in recent years. London, UK - 22 March 2017 A terrorist attack took place in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster in London. The attack was carried out by Briton Khalid Masood, who drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, injuring dozens, four of them fatally. It was later confirmed that a fifth victim, named as 31-year-old Andreea Cristea, had died. She had fallen off the bridge into the River Thames during the attack. Berlin, Germany — 19 December 2016 A hijacked truck driven by 24-year-old Anis Amri ploughed into a Christmas market in central Berlin killing 12 people, including the Polish driver from who the vehicle was stolen, and injuring 56. Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker, had pledged allegiance to Isis before carrying out the attack. He went on the run for several days before being discovered in Milan, Italy, where he was shot dead during a confrontation with police. Nice, France — 14 July 2016 On the evening of 14 July 2016, a 19-tonne truck was deliberately driven through crowds celebrating Bastille Day on a promenade in Nice in southern France. The driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a Tunisian resident of France, zig-zagged his way through the crowds, resulting in the deaths of 86 people, including children. He injured more than 400. The attack ended after an exchange of gunfire, during which Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was shot and killed by police. Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. Flowers lay where the Nice attack took placeAnne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP Jerusalem — 14 December 2015 Fourteen people were injured when Palestinian 21-year-old Abdul Mohsen Hassouna ploughed his car into a group of people at a bus stop in Jerusalem.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.thecrownchronicles.co.uk/royal-news/catherine-duchess-cambridge-speaks-of-parenting-pressures-pays-tribute-to-westminster-attack-victims-best-beginnings/","text":"During an engagement in London earlier today, The Duchess of Cambridge paid tribute to the victims of the terrorist attack in Westminster, also admitting as a parent she struggles with a lack of confidence under the desire to be ‘perfect’. At the Royal College for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists near Regent’s Park, Catherine attended a reception for Best Beginnings’ Out of the Blue series, a programme of educational films promoting mental health for parents and their children. Her engagement was not altered, though The Queen cancelled her engagement to open New Scotland Yard to ease pressure on the police force. Best Beginnings works with Heads Together, which William, Kate and Harry founded to end the stigma of mental health. In a speech at the event, the Duchess remembered those affected by the incident yesterday, which has now claimed four lives, plus that of the attacker. “I know you will all want to join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to all those sadly affected by yesterday’s terrible attack in Westminster. We will be thinking of all the families as we discuss the important issues we are here to talk about.” Kate then spoke of the hardships of becoming a mother, calling it a combination of ‘joy, exhaustion, love, and worry’. “Nothing can really prepare you for you the sheer overwhelming experience of what it means to become a mother.” “Personally, becoming a mother has been such a rewarding and wonderful experience. However, at times it has also been a huge challenge – even for me who has support at home that most mothers do not,” she said, recognising that as a Royal she has the chance to have nannies and housekeepers to help look after Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The Duchess of Cambridge and her family – today she spoke of the pressures of parenting, trying to be perfect (Picture by Stephen Lock / i-Images) “Nothing can really prepare you for you the sheer overwhelming experience of what it means to become a mother. It is full of complex emotions of joy, exhaustion, love, and worry, all mixed together. Your fundamental identity changes overnight. “You go from thinking of yourself as primarily an individual, to suddenly being a mother, first and foremost. And yet there is no rule book, no right or wrong – you just have to make it up and do the very best you can to care for your family.” The Duchess then admitted: “For many mothers, myself included, this can, at times lead to lack of confidence and feelings of ignorance.” “Many of these women also suffer in silence, overwhelmed by negative feelings, but also afraid to admit to the struggles they are facing due to the fear or shame of what others might think if they ‘aren’t coping’. “Some of this fear is about the pressure to be a perfect parent; pretending we’re all coping perfectly and loving every minute of it. “It’s right to talk about motherhood as a wonderful thing, but we also need to talk about its stresses and strains. It’s ok not to find it easy. Asking for help should not be seen as a sign of weakness.” As has been compared so many times before in speeches on mental health, Kate stated that no one would question seeking medical advice if a woman caught a fever during pregnancy. “Getting help with our mental health is no different – our children need us to look after ourselves and get the support we need,” she said. “Conversations are crucial for mental wellbeing and they should be part of everyday family life. Talking about a problem with a friend or another trusted person can be the beginning of getting better. The Duchess of Cambridge at a parent support group spoke with mums and dads about how becoming a parent affected their mental health, as she attended the launch of Best Beginnings ‘Out of the Blue’ short films. (Picture by i-Images / Pool) “This week, as we look forward to Mother’s Day, I would love to see everyone celebrate and value the fundamental importance that mothers play in family life. “Mothers take on an overwhelming responsibility of caring for their families. Their role is vital in providing unconditional love, care, and support at home, particularly in the early years of a child’s development. We therefore should do everything we can to support and value their hard work. ” After her speech and seeing the short films, The Duchess of Cambridge sat in on a parental support group where mothers and fathers told her of their experiences. Kirsty Francois was 19 when she had her daughter Tegan-Mia, now 2. She found herself homeless after experiencing problems with her daughter’s father, despite working in a nursery. Nothing she dealt with at work, she told Catherine, compared to having to deal with being a mother herself. “It got to a point where I was trying to support all three of us and I just was’t coping. I became so withdrawn from her. My nurse recognised that there was clearly some depression there. That unleashed everything I had held back for long,” Kirsty said in the discussion.

Her specialism is the Early Modern era, with particular emphasis on the Tudor and Stuart dynasties. She is also a keen reader (usually something historical), baker and shopper. Her motto is to have a full bookcase, but a fuller wardrobe.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/21/hospital-review-westminster-attack-terrorist-incident","text":"St Mary’s hospital, London, 22 March of this year. In the chief executive’s office, the director of nursing is chairing a staff resource meeting. The vacancy rate is running between 12% and 14%. Perhaps this episode of Hospital (BBC2) was going to be mainly about recruitment in the shadow of Brexit. Someone’s phone rings, though, then someone else’s. There has been a major incident on Westminster Bridge. It seems anomalous and a bit wrong to talk of fortunate timing when you’re also talking about a terror attack, in which people have been injured and lost their lives. But it was, in some way, lucky that the cameras were there and could record the immediate aftermath of one of the horrors that seem to be becoming part of our everyday existence. The result is extraordinary television – a powerful, moving portrait of a major trauma centre’s response to such an event, and of the brilliant human beings who work there. The first job is the logistical nightmare of shunting people around: out of beds, out of theatres, cancelling operations, making way. It makes you wonder how a system already under so much pressure would cope with this kind of incident. But there’s no time to worry about that as the first patient arrives, a gunshot victim on a blood-soaked stretcher. He is the attacker himself, accompanied by several anti-terror police, and he is quickly declared “RIP”. Which seems generous. But to the staff, he’s just another patient, of course, with clinical problems to be addressed like anyone else. “It does test your faith in humanity, seeing how horrible people can be to each other,” says consultant anaesthetist Dr Helgi Johannsson. “But also we see a lot of very uplifting things that make you think: d’you know, actually, humanity is all right.” Next in is one of the French school kids who ended up caught up in the chaos. Victor, 16 – who was hit by the car head on – has a dislocated elbow, spinal injuries, multiple rib fractures and a collapsed lung. He is scanned, patched up, stabilised, then handed a phone. He asks his parents back home in France whether they are going to come to the hospital. That was my first choke-up (of a few), because suddenly it’s just not a shocking news story, or a worrying one about the NHS under strain; it’s the story of a frightened child who has been hurt in a foreign country and just wants to see his mum and dad. Victor’s friend Yann, 18, arrives, with a big head wound. He’s immediately taken for life-saving surgery. And there’s Stephen, with injuries to his face, chest and lower leg. It’s Stephen’s 40th birthday; he had been to the London Aquarium with his wife Cara. They were on the bridge to catch a taxi because Cara was nervous about going on the tube, in case something happened. She’s here, in tears. “It’s really hard when you spend so much time with somebody and then they’re taken away and you’re suddenly really, really alone,” she says. It makes you wonder, if the attacker, Khalid Masood, wasn’t RIP or RIH, or whatever, if he had survived and looked over from his bed where NHS doctors were doing their damnedest to save his life, and he’d seen young Victor and Yann, Stephen and Cara in tears, would he really have thought, ‘Yeah, I did good there’? Doctor Johannsson was right though – there’s plenty of evidence here of the all-rightness of humanity as well. From him and all the other docs and staff at St Mary’s, of course, doing their amazing work, and from the patients, too. The loveliest moments are Victor and Yann seeing each other again. “Your new look is working for you,” Victor deadpanly tells his friend (whose head is shaved and stapled and stitched – basically, he looks like a Halloween mask). Victor asks Yann about the souvenirs from Harrods they had been carrying . “I have nothing, just my underpants,” says Yann. “The guy fucked me into nakedness on the pavement.” Congratulations Yann, it’s only June but I think you’ve already won the Subtitled Quote of the Year award. And you and Victor both pull through, with your excellent Gallic charm and wit intact. In fact, Masood was the only one of the St Mary’s patients not to make it. Elsewhere, five others also died. And that really was down to luck, the very worst luck. For the staff of St Mary’s, there’s another trauma incident to deal with: a bad stabbing, unrelated.

Over the past year Londoners of every faith and race have come together to show enduring resilience and unity, rather than let a pathetic individual divide us. We value our freedom highly and remain a city rich with cultural and religious diversity. The hearts and minds of this city have carried on, free of the hatred that drives those seeking to incite division through violence. By taking positive action in our local communities and going about our daily business as usual we are ensuring that the attempts made by terrorists are in vain. A city that is united tackles terrorism together.Mustafa Field, Faiths Forum for London As conscious as I am of PC Palmer’s exceptional bravery last year when confronting an intruder at the gates of Parliament, I still do not understand why this brave officer was left without armed support? I recall when queuing to enter Westminster Hall for the lying-in-state of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, I was confronted by an armed policeman simply for being in a queue of mourners. What’s the difference?David Alston EDITOR'S REPLY Dear Mustafa & David Thank you for your letters. Tomorrow’s anniversary will inevitably bring sad memories but it’s right to say that despite the succession of terror attacks which followed Westminster, one of the heartening things about the past year has been the resilience and unity displayed by Londoners. That’s not to say there aren’t concerns. The rise of far-Right extremism is one, while police believe the Westminster murders inspired the later London Bridge attack and that the Islamist threat has grown too. Indeed, they warned recently of the danger of the rival ideologies feeding off each other to justify violence. Fortunately, most people remain immune to such poison but vigilance is needed. The question of whether PC Palmer should have been armed is understandable. But Met Commissioner Cressida Dick says she is unsure whether he would have been able to fire because so many members of the public were nearby. Martin Bentham, Home Affairs Editor What's the point in having superhighways if cyclists don't use them? Having put up with several years of inconvenience and congestion as cycle superhighways were installed at great expense, I am disappointed to see how few cyclists actually use them. Most of the hi-vis crowd use the main roads, causing friction (sometimes literally) with buses, taxis and lorries, which now have only one lane in each direction to use. Worse still, many of these cycling commuters seem to be a law unto themselves. I realise that stopping at a red light is a pain as it adds time to your journey, but cyclists must adhere to the same laws as everyone else. I have also observed that some only have one light or none at all. As a cyclist and motorcyclist, I consider myself to be subject to the same rules, obligations and constraints. Sadly, many do not.Tim Davies More clarity over EU workers It's good that that the UK and EU have now agreed an “orderly withdrawal” from the EU. However, there are still many unanswered questions for businesses. An agreement on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa is said to have been reached but when will there be full transparency about this? We have staff located in Europe and many of our UK-based workforce are from the EU. We need a diverse range of language skills as well as an understanding of the nuances of how different cultures travel. But we are still no clearer on what Brexit will mean in terms of trading conditions or for our staff. Until the Government fully clarifies what Brexit will look like both during and after the transitional period, we remain in limbo.Rob Russell, Joint-CEO, AC Group Clarke's right about the customs union In his interview with the Evening Standard Ken Clarke was absolutely right in calling for a free vote on staying in the customs union after Brexit [“Get May off hook by voting to stay in customs union, Ken Clarke urges MPs”, March 19]. At a stroke this would solve the Irish border issue, prevent the likely 30-mile tailbacks on the Dover road, and minimise the economic damage to both the UK and Ireland. Also, given the fact that we are already nearly 650 days past the date of the referendum and with around 2,000 young people a day reaching the age of 18 — most of them who are likely to be strongly against the idea of Brexit — it would reduce the inevitable demand for rejoining in a few years’ time. I would have thought Brexiteers would welcome this.Alan Pavelin Businesses should help new parents The Women and Equalities Committee’s call for ministers to look at giving fathers 12 weeks off for paternity leave is long overdue but welcome. It is positive to see the Government finally recognising that longer periods of time off are a crucial part of effective policies for working parents. While we wait for these new policies to come into effect businesses should be working to provide all new parents with flexible working hours. Not only does this allow dads and mums to adjust to returning to work while balancing family life, it also makes strong business sense. The tools and technology are available to enable new parents to remain productive while returning to work from paternity and maternity leave, so there is little standing in businesses’ way.Jason

{"originalUrl":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/car-crashes-security-barrier-outside-065342818.html","text":"The man being taken away by armed police was arrested on suspicion of terror offences - Sky News A terror suspect arrested after a car crashed into a barrier at the Houses of Parliament at high speed is not believed to be known to the security services, police have said. At least three people were injured when the silver Ford Fiesta hit a group of cyclists and pedestrians waiting for traffic lights to change. Rooftop camera footage shows the car mounting a pavement on the wrong side of the road before, witnesses said, it travelled at up to 50mph for around 40 metres (130ft) and hit a bollard. Scotland Yard said a man in his late 20s was arrested after the incident at around 7.30am on Tuesday. The suspect was taken to a south London police station, where he remains on suspicion of terrorism offences. He is not co-operating with officers. The Met's counter-terrorism command is leading the investigation into the latest attack. Officers are seeking to formally identify the suspect, but \"don't believe this person is known to either MI5 or counter-terrorism police\". The suspect is reported to be from the Midlands and it is believed that he might have travelled to London from Birmingham. The man being taken away by armed police was arrested on suspicion of terror offencesCredit: Sky News Westminster was in lockdown as armed police swarmed the scene. One witness said: \"It looked intentional - the car drove at speed and towards the barriers.\" Images showed a man being led away in handcuffs after armed police surrounded the eight-year-old car. A second image appears to show pedestrians hit by the vehicle at least 40 metres (130ft) away from where the car hit the barrier. Injured pedestrians can be seen at the top of the shot - around 40 metres from where the car crashed into a barrierCredit: BBC News/PA No one else was in the car and police said no weapons had been recovered from the scene. Speaking outside New Scotland Yard, Neil Basu, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner for counter-terrorism, said police and the intelligence services were working to establish if the suspect was part of a wider terror cell and if he had received assistance from others in planning the attack. Mr Basu said: “It appears to have been a deliberate act, but what the motive was we can’t answer at the moment. We haven’t formally identified the suspect, but we don’t believe he’s known to MI5.” He added the attacker was not been pursued by police before he struck the entrance to the Palace of Westminster and that the blue lights seen behind him in footage of the incident were those of an ambulance coincidentally answering a separate emergency call. Witness Barry Williams said the car had accelerated towards the barrier after hitting the cyclists. \"I turned round to see a silver car heading towards the cyclists on the wrong side of the road, they were parked waiting for the lights to change,\" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \"He hit the cyclists then swerved over towards where the safety barrier is.... and accelerated and hit it at quite a high speed. \"I wasn't sure whether he meant to hit the cyclists, they might have just been in the way, but once he did, he accelerated towards the barrier. Smoke rises from the car after it crashed into a barrier outside ParliamentCredit: Ewelina U Ochab /PA He added: \"The police were very fast, they vaulted over the safety barrier and headed towards the car. \"What also happened was the police started to head away to block off people heading towards us. The cyclists...there was a few on the ground, some were holding their arms, there was bikes everywhere. It was frightening.\" Mr Williams added: \"There was about 10 cyclists waiting for the lights to change... he hit about four or five - one of the cyclists got up and was about to chase the car.\" Palace of Westminster car crash Aerial footage of the crash shows the silver Ford Fiesta coming along the road next to Parliament Square before moving to turn right towards Westminster Abbey. As an ambulance passes the car on its right-hand side, the vehicle swerves left - crossing oncoming traffic and a pavement before entering a small road and crashing into a security barrier. A police officer can be seen jumping another barrier that runs along the side of the road to get away. The car, circled, drives past Westminster Abbey After knocking down cyclists, the car mounts a pavement A police officer jumps a barrier as the car approaches Parliament Square was evacuated as a large number of police cars descended on the heart of Westminster, which has seen heightened security since the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017. Streets around Parliament Square, Millbank and Victoria Tower Gardens were also cordoned off as dozens of armed police swooped on the scene. A series of ambulances had been sent to the scene and the London Ambulance Service said two people were treated for injuries that are not thought to be serious and taken to hospital. A third person was assessed for minor injuries at the scene. 'It looked deliberate... he hit bollard at 50mph' Local businessman Jason Williams was walking to work when he saw the crash unfold. The 45-year-old, from Kennington, south London, said: \"He had driven it at speed - more than 40 mph. There was smoke coming out of the car.\" He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I have seen people on the ground, lying on the road. I don't know if they have actually been hit by the vehicle or not. I saw at least 10 people lying down. \"I was told basically to move away, to run. I have run for my life.\" Injured cyclists on the ground after the car crashed into themCredit: Twitter Mr Williams told Good Morning Britain: \"I saw a car going at high speed towards Parliament. It hit a bollard.\" He added: \"It looked deliberate. It didn't look like an accident. How do you do that by accident? It was a loud bang.\" Mr Williams added: \"He's obviously gone into the bollard at high speed. \"It seemed it was about 40-50mph, there wasn't any shouting or anything - I've seen smoke coming from the vehicle. \"He did get out [of the car], I was behind and I did hear a loud bang and I'm seeing what's going on, but I couldn't hear if the police asked him to get out. The specialists came soon after, I'd say within 5-9 minutes.\" He said the suspect was quiet when he was taken away by the police.

A third person was assessed for minor injuries but not taken to hospital. A bicycle lies on the ground after the Westminster attackCredit: Eddie Mulholland for The Telegraph Assistant Director of Operations Peter Rhodes said: \"We were called at 7.40am today (14 August) to reports of an incident on St Margaret Street, SW1. \"We sent a number of resources to the scene including three ambulance crews, responders in cars and an incident response officer. \"We have treated two people at the scene for injuries that are not believed to be serious and have taken them to hospital.\" 'Cyclists were scattered everywhere... then we heard this huge bang' Witness Kirsty Moseley, 31, was sitting in a car behind the cyclists at the traffic lights. She said: “The first thing we noticed was his car driving at high speed into the cyclists. Then he went straight through them and rather than continuing and hitting us he swerved and went over the central reservation. “The cyclists were scattered everywhere and then we just heard this huge bang. That’s when we looked round and he had driven into the barriers. One cyclist got up and started screaming at him to come back. We were all in shock at that point. “There was an ambulance that happened to be driving past at that very moment, so it was there to help the injured within seconds. Then the police were there so quickly and there were so many of them.” Bicycles lie on the ground at the scene of the crash outside the Houses of Parliament Credit: HANNAH MCKAY /Reuters On the driver, she said: \"I saw him drive past. He wasn’t shouting and he just had two hands on the wheel. He was just staring straight ahead. He looked quite sure. He was just peering over the steering wheel. He knew what he was doing and he was focused on what was in front of him rather than being erratic or shouting. “After seeing how he drove into them, we are amazed that only one woman has been seriously injured.” Miss Moseley was on her way to work in Oxford Circus with her husband, Patrick Moseley, 34, from their Brixton home. “We don’t usually drive,” she said. “We usually cycle, but for some reason we decided to drive this morning.” Video: Minute-by-minute - how the crash unfolded Westminster council leader: Our democracy, and our way of life, will continue to defy those who try to undermine it Responding to the attack, Nickie Aiken, the leader of Westminster City Council, said: “Our thoughts are with those hurt and our thanks to the brilliant emergency services who were so quickly at the scene. “The House of Commons was targeted again today – as it was last year – but our democracy, and our way of life, will continue to defy those who try to undermine it. “The safety of the people who live, work and visit in Westminster remains our priority and we will work to ensure our capital remains a welcoming city.” US ambassador: America's prayers are with all the innocent people hurt Woody Johnson, US ambassador to the UK, wrote on Twitter that \"America's prayers are with all the innocent people hurt\", as he also praised the emergency services: Terrible events at Westminster. America’s prayers are with all the innocent people hurt this morning. As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: the police, the paramedics, the ambulance drivers – they ALWAYS do this country proud. Police have stopped 17 terror plots in 18 months The terrorist threat against the UK is seen as unprecedented. In addition to five attacks last year, authorities say they have stopped 13 Islamist and four extreme right-wing plots since the Westminster atrocity in March 2017. Police and MI5 are running at least 500 live operations involving roughly 3,000 active \"subjects of interest\" at any one time - while there is also a wider pool of more than 20,000 individuals who have previously featured in investigations whose threat must be kept under review. Earlier this year, the Government unveiled a refreshed counter-terror strategy. Under the blueprint, MI5 intelligence will be shared with bodies outside the security community in an attempt to stop suspects before attack plots can crystallise, while anti-terror laws are to be strengthened to allow earlier interventions. Tobias Ellwood: This is stark reminder of threats we continue to face Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood, who was branded a hero after stepping in to help emergency services in the wake of the 2017 attack outside Parliament, said today's incident was a \"stark reminder of the threats we continue to face\". He wrote on Twitter: WESTMINSTER INCIDENT: A stark reminder of the threats we continue to face, the need to remain vigilant and the professionalism of @metpoliceuk in once again swiftly and courageously responding to what looks like a crude and deliberate attack on Parliament.#westminsterpic.twitter.com/kxNO6Ra3cu And Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"Thank goodness the barriers are in place and worked.\" Our thoughts are with those who have been injured in the incident outside the Houses of Parliament this morning, and our thanks go out to the quick and effective response of our police and medical services. Thank goodness the barriers are in place and worked. Police treating Westminster car crash as terror attack Scotland Yard said in a new statement: \"At 07:37hrs on Tuesday 14 August, a silver Ford Fiesta collided with a number of cyclists and pedestrians, before crashing into barriers outside the Houses of Parliament. \"The driver of the car, a man in his late 20s, was arrested at the scene by armed officers.

Donovan Parsons, who was filming for ITN nearby, said: “We saw people running away from the crash and quickly realised it was more than just an accident. “As I got there I saw a silver car smoking against the barrier at the entrance to Westminster Palace and armed police scouting the area. “Then four 4x4 police vehicles turned up and armed cops jumped out and pointed their guns inside the car. They then dragged this guy out and I could see them pointing their guns inside the car. That’s when we got pushed back behind the cordons.”","title":"Westminster 'terror attack': Driver arrested after car mows down cyclists and ploughs into Parliament

{"originalUrl":"https://wayback.archive.org/web/20180814233015/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45189831","text":"Searches took place at two addresses in Birmingham and a residential property in the Radford and Arboretum area of Nottingham. A woman who witnessed police arriving to search the Nottingham property told the BBC the raid took place between about 15:00 and 16:00 BST. She said other officers in plain clothes remained at the scene for a few hours. Sham Khatun said: \"A van parked up outside the house, they broke into the house. They shouted 'Police!', they broke a couple of doors.\" Suspect 'not co-operating' Scotland Yard's head of counter terrorism Neil Basu said: \"Given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method and this being an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident.\" The assistant commissioner added there was \"no intelligence at this time of further danger\" to London or the UK as a whole. The suspect, who has not been formally identified, is being held at a south London police station but police said he was not co-operating with officers. Security minister Ben Wallace said he was British but originally from another country. Image caption A residential property in Nottingham (seen on the left of this picture) was raided by police in connection with the inquiry Labour's Roger Godsiff, MP for Birmingham Hall Green, tweeted that the driver was \"believed to have been living in my constituency\". Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"The briefing I have received from counter-terrorism police and the security services is that work is ongoing and they are doing everything they can to find out more about the incident. Image copyrightAFPImage caption Only the area around the scene of the crash remains sealed off Image caption Cyclists were seen on the ground after the crash Police say the vehicle was driven from Birmingham to London on Monday night, was in the Tottenham Court Road area until about 06:00 and was seen driving around Westminster and Whitehall for 90 minutes before the incident. A number of eyewitnesses have said the silver Ford Fiesta, which was travelling westbound in Parliament Square, appeared to deliberately hit members of the public as it swerved into the opposite lane. 'Formidable courage' Footage released by the BBC shows the moment when the car then crosses over a traffic island in the middle of the road before crashing into the security barriers. A police officer can be seen jumping over another barrier to get out of the way. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionWitness: \"I saw a man drive towards Parliament at speed\" Westminster Tube station was closed and streets around Millbank and Parliament Square cordoned off for several hours. The immediate area around the incident remains taped off and screened by white temporary fencing. Parliament is not currently sitting. British Transport Police said it was increasing patrols in England, Scotland and Wales and that its officers would be \"highly visible on trains and at stations\". The prime minister paid tribute to the \"formidable courage\" and professionalism of the emergency services who \"ran towards a dangerous situation in order to protect the public\". Urging the public to remain vigilant but \"carry on as normal\", Theresa May added: \"For the second time in as many years the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door.\" The Houses of Parliament are surrounded with security barriers of steel and concrete. The measures were extended in the wake of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017 when Khalid Masood ploughed a car into crowds on Westminster Bridge, killing four people. Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Security arrangements at Parliament have progressively tightened since 2001. In the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks, new truck bomb-proof barriers were installed in an effort to \"target harden\" Westminster. These include the reinforced low black rampart-like walls that surround Parliament itself and a highly visible armed police presence. Visitors need to go through a chicane-like system designed to help armed officers spot suspects. The one significant weak spot was the main vehicle gates - as became apparent in March 2017's one-man attack. That triggered an internal security review that has led to changes that remain secret - although it's apparent to Londoners that there are now more armed police than ever before patrolling the area. The threat of terrorism is a constant concern for Parliamentarians - it's not new. Irish republican paramilitaries murdered Airey Neave MP in 1979 in a car bomb that exploded within the palace grounds. And the dilemma remains the same: how best to balance security with guaranteeing that the heart of British democracy remains open to the people. The prime minister's official spokesman said as of the end June 2018 there were 676 live investigations into potential terrorist plots. He said since March 2017, 13 Islamist plots and four far-right plots had been foiled. Scotland Yard is asking anyone with information on Tuesday's crash to call 0800 789 321. Anyone with video or pictures of the crash is asked to send them to police.","title":"Westminster crash: Raids after suspected terror attack - BBC

Friends of Tony Walter, 52, say he took his own life because he “didn’t want to live in a world where these terror attacks continue”. One friend claimed he was the “23rd victim” of the Manchester Arena bombing.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/wesminster-attack-khalid-masood-took-steroids-terrorist-london-parliament-isis-inquest-latest-a8159926.html?utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter","text":"The terrorist who killed five people in the Westminster attack had taken steroids before launching the frenzied rampage, a court has heard. The possible effect of steroid use on Khalid Masood will be considered alongside a “psychological autopsy” during the inquest into his death. It will examine whether he was radicalised in prison, the extent of his contact with Anjem Choudary’s al-Muhajiroun network and what the security services learned during an MI5 investigation that declared Masood a “subject of interest” in 2009. The inquest, where Masood’s widow is among interested parties, will piece together his preparations including obtaining the knives and car used in the attack and consider “whether his activities gave any warning signs”. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, the Chief Coroner of England and Wales, ruled that the inquest will be held before a jury, as required for all deaths involving contact with police. Specialist witnesses will be called to hearings at the Old Bailey to reconstruct the events of 22 March and Masood’s preparations, including body armour experts charged with examining PC Palmer’s “inadequate” protection. Judge Lucraft expressed his condolences to their families and the hope that answering their many questions could “provide some comfort”. “The inquest can point everyone in the right direction to do more to address these problems... which occur again and again in trial after trial,” Mr Patterson said. “We do not understand why radicalising material remains freely available on the internet. “We do not understand why it’s necessary for WhatsApp, Telegram and other applications to have end-to-end encryption.” Mr Patterson also questioned how Masood managed to get through the gates surrounding the Houses of Parliament and “how it was PC Palmer was apparently stationed alone and unarmed with, it seems, inadequate body protection”. Masood, 52, was born in Kent as Adrian Russell and was known to police after seven convictions for violent crime leading up to 2003, when he may have converted to Islam during his last spell in prison.

Masood’s case was closed in 2012 following a security review, appearing intermittently as contact of subject in Choudary’s network before starting preparations for his attack in 2016. From the end of that year, he told his family he was considering working overseas, but his job and visa applications failed. Masood bought the knives used in the attack on 9 March, sending himself an email with the subject line “Retaliation” on the same day. Six days later, he created a document entitled “Jihad in the Quran and Sunnah”, with his photograph on the front page and multiple extracts from the Quran that could be seen as supportive of jihad and martyrdom. He collected the Hyundai Tucson on 16 March, conducted reconnaissance of Westminster Bridge three days later and browsed YouTube for videos relating to terrorism and suicide attacks. Minutes before launching the attack, Masood shared his document with numerous WhatsApp contacts, which was soon sent onwards via iMessage and SMS A review of the intelligence gathered in the run-up to the Westminster, Manchester, London Bridge and Finsbury Park attacks found that Masood had not been re-considered as a potential threat by MI5. “No intelligence was being gathered on him and neither MI5 nor the police had any reason the anticipate the attack,” said David Anderson QC. “You’re looking at someone who is such a long way from the top of anyone’s grid that frankly, it’s a bit difficult to see how they would have been easily stopped, whatever agencies had done.”","title":"Westminster terrorist Khalid Masood took steroids before launching attack, inquest hears | The

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/this-is-the-man-behind-the-westminster-attack?utm_term=.ujq0xn7kMO#.arzMXNZvDJ","text":"Khalid Masood, the man who attacked parliament this week, was born Adrian Elms in Dartford, Kent, on Christmas Day in 1964. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. Masood had been investigated “some years ago” as part of an investigation into violent extremism, prime minister Theresa May told MPs on Thursday. But despite a history of violent criminal offences he was only ever seen as \"peripheral\" in historical terror investigations. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. A former intelligence official told BuzzFeed News: \"The service had him as an SOI [subject of interest] a few years ago but think he didn't meet the threshold for investigation so was not investigated further.\" They added: \"My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he's acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint.\" Metropolitan police Khalid Masood The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \"Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.” Masood’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. In 2000, while living in the village of Northiam, Sussex, Masood, still known then as Elms, was convicted for slashing a man’s face after an argument in a pub. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott. This was a long time ago. I remember Elms being a bit of a troubled character.” Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News The block of flats where Masood lived most recently in Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham. A next-door neighbour who gave her name as Iwona, 45, said he had lived there for seven months. \"I am really surprised, I cannot believe it, I cannot believe it,” she told BuzzFeed News. “As I said, when I saw him I couldn't even think someone could do something like this. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. “Sometimes in the afternoon I saw him taking care of the garden, washing the car, and he was very calm.\" Iwona described the woman he lived with there as being in her thirties and said she wore \"Islamic clothing\". The neighbour said she hadn't seen Masood for a few months and that he just \"took a van and went\". Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. \"The family moved quickly and took their things out of the garage,\" Iwona said. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News Masood's neighbour Iwona at her flat in Quayside, Birmingham. Another neighbour, who gave her name as Sam, said: “He moved out in December and I never really spoke to him. I didn't know his name before. “He had a little boy who was 5 years old. There was a woman – I didn't know if it was his wife or daughter. We’d just say hello in the street.” It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Department for Education said Masood never held qualified status as a teacher, but according to The Sun newspaper he claimed on his CV to have an economics degree and to be a “senior English teacher” at a TEFL college in Luton in 2009. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, the prime minister confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”. Echoing police, she said the “working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology”. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. “He was just like any other guest who checks into the hotel,\" he said. \"We had a brief conversation about where he came from in Birmingham. “He talked about his family, his mum, his dad, his wife. He said his dad was ill and his mum was upset.” Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. Huntleys School website “I am really, really shocked. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. The picture of us in the football team was after we did a 24-hour sponsored football match to raise money for the sports hall,” said Stuart Knight, who went to school with Masood, to TheGuardian. “We would have been about 14 years old. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

{"originalUrl":"http://henzyworld.com/2017/03/23/westminster-terror-attack-victims-super-eagles-to-wear-black-arm-bands-in-honor-of-the-victim/","text":"The Nigeria Football Federation has proposed to the organisers of the Nigeria versus Senegal international friendly tonight in London if they can pay tribute to the victims of Wednesday’s terror attack, by wearing black arm bands and observe a minute silence in honour of those that lost their lives in the suspected terror attack in Westminster, central London . On Wednesday Five people were killed and dozens injured when a suspected terrorist drove through pedestrians on Westminster bridge, killing three members of the public before stabbing a 48-year-old man to death. Meanwhile, the arrivals on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning of goalkeepers Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi have helped bring down the blood pressure of technical officials of the Super Eagles ahead of the two international friendly matches against Senegal and Burkina Faso. An interesting match is at hand as Nigeria seek a 10th win over Senegal in 21 clashes at senior level. Venue is The Hive, home ground of League 2 teams Barnet FC and London Bees. Organisers told thenff.com that they expect about 3,000 spectators at the 6,000-capacity ground. Both nations first clashed at senior level on February 27, 1963, Nigeria winning an Nkrumah Cup game 4-0, but the Senegalese replied in equal measure six weeks later, hammering the Eagles 5-1 in a Friendship Games match in Dakar. Senegal then stopped Nigeria from the race to the Munich ’72 Olympics, winning 3-2 on aggregate, but Nigeria also constituted stumbling block to Senegal in the race to the 1978 Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana, winning 4-3 on aggregate. Nigeria defeated host Senegal 2-1 in the opening match of the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations, and won by the same margin when eliminating the Teranga Lions in the quarter -finals of the 2000 edition that she co-hosted with Ghana. The Lions paid back by beating Nigeria (same scoreline) in the semi-finals of the 2002 Cup of Nations in Mali. But Nigeria has won the past two encounters between both nations, both at the 2006 Cup of Nations in Egypt: a group phase match in Port Said that ended 2-1 and the bronze medal match that ended 1-0 in Cairo.

He said: \"What I am able to say to the House is there has been a serious incident within the estate. \"It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police. GETTY London is on lockdown following the attack, which has left dozens injured \"An air ambulance is currently attending the scene to remove the casualties. \"There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster. \"But I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate that it'd be wrong of me to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and from the House security authorities about what is going on.\" GETTY MPs have paid tribute to the brave police officers who secured the scene Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, told Express.co.uk: \"I can see people injured on Westminster Bridge. There are a lot of ambulances. \"I was coming down the escalators with loads of other people and police suddenly stopped us all. \"There was no way back up and it was a bottleneck. GETTY Forensics officers work at the scene of the London terror attack \"It was very scary.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3171801/london-attack-terrorist-khalid-masood-westminster-terror-isis-link-arrests/","text":"Fears London attack terrorist Khalid Masood was ‘assisted by others’ as cops arrest 11 and MI5 probes theory he was ‘directed by ISIS’ There are fears the killer who carried out a devastating attack on Westminster was lured to do so by ISIS mentors By Ellie Cambridge and Mike Sullivan, Crime Editor 24th March 2017, 3:40 pm Updated: 25th March 2017, 7:53 pm POLICE are desperately trying to establish if the Westminster killer acted totally alone or if he was directed on his mission by jihadi mentors. There are fears Khalid Masood may have been encouraged by others to carry out the attack, as three more people were today arrested and police probe the theory he had been radicalised before striking in London. Counter-terrorist detectives are attempting to trace any associates of the killer as they weed out what triggered the terrorist's rampage. This comes as the number of arrests following the horrific attack on the capital rose to 11 today. Since the night of the attack on Westminster police have raided homes across the UK and arrested people on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 27-year-old man was held in Birmingham last night and a man aged 35 was arrested during a swoop in Manchester. A woman aged 32 was also held in Manchester this morning. They were all arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts and quizzed by police trying to piece together how he came to carry out the attack. Do you have any pictures or information about London terror attacker Khalid Masood - aka Adrian Elms or Adrian Russell Ajao? We pay for your photos and stories! Email us at tips@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4368 Security chiefs believe the father-of-three could have been assisted by others and directed on his mission of by jihadi mentors. The terror group ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack as A'map news agency reported Masoof was a \"soldier of the Islamic state\". Armed officers made two further “significant” arrests overnight in Birmingham and Manchester as part of a nationwide investigation, code-named Operation Classific, being led by the Met Police SO15 counter-terrorism command into the attack.

A clearer picture of Masood's movements before he wrought carnage on Westminster is beginning to emerge. He stayed in the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton, reportedly telling staff as he checked out that he was going to London. He added: \"It isn't what it used to be.\" The manager of the hotel said the terrorist had been \"laughing and joking, telling us stories about where he lived\", hours before the atrocity. Meanwhile, the widow of a man attacked with a knife by Masood in a pub assault said her late husband was injured after defending someone during a row. Masood was jailed for two years over the 2000 attack in the car park of a pub in Northiam, near Rye in East Sussex, according to a news report at the time. His criminal activity was enough to catch the eye of authorities, with Prime Minister Theresa May revealing that he had been investigated by MI5 several years ago - but was dismissed as a \"peripheral figure\". It is now known he took on at least three names before carrying out the atrocity in the heart of London – which killed a police officer. The English teacher had a string of aliases and was born in South East London under the name Adrian Elms. He grew up in Tunbridge Wells, Sussex, where he was known as Adrian Elms before taking on his stepfather's surname of Ajao. AC Rowley added: \"There might well be people out there who did have concerns about Masood but weren't sure or didn't feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing information to us. \"I urge anyone with such information to contact us the Anti-Terrorist hotline which is 0800 789 321.”","title":"Fears London attack terrorist Khalid Masood was 'assisted by others' as cops arrest 11 and MI5 probes

Their coach Tony Davis was with them and attempted to save Palmer's life after he had suffered what proved to be fatal injuries. Despite the way the troubling scenes affected them, the British Lionhearts fighters chose to persist with Thursday evening's World Series of Boxing fixture against Italia Thunder and impressively secured a 5-0 victory overall. The Italians were also present at Westminster alongside fighters Frazer Clarke, Pat McCormack, Muhammad Ali, Calum French and Bulgarian Radoslav Pantaleev at the event celebrating one year of the British Lionhearts in the Community. The Lionhearts were on their way to an exit on New Palace Yard when the attack on Palmer took place, before his attacker Khalid Masood was shot by police. Flyweight and 2016 Olympian Ali was the first to fight, doing so just 30 hours after Wednesday's events, and secured the first of four unanimous-decision points victories despite a second-round knockdown. \"We were just going out when it happened,\" said the 19-year-old. \"All day, I couldn't get it out of my head because we saw everything. \"The coaches spoke to us about what went on, because we had to focus (on Thursday evening's fights).\" Of his defeat of Manuel Cappai, he added: \"It was good to get the victory, but I'm just disappointed I got dropped. \"What happened was a shock, but you have to get on with things.\" Welterweight McCormack, 21, who overcame Vincenzo Mangiacapre, said: \"It was horrible. We were right in front of it. It was weird timing that we saw it all, but it's not something anyone wants to see. \"I didn't really sleep much. My head was a bit all over and I couldn't really stop thinking about it but I'm just glad I've come, got the job done and the win. \"We had a meeting, a talk. The coaches handled it very well, got us through it. \"Tony was standing right next to us, and as everyone was running away he was running to aid. He saw a lot more than us and was a bit shook up. I respect him very much as a man for doing that.\" French, also 21 and who won at lightweight against Michael Magnesi, did not share McCormack's trouble sleeping but said: \"It was the most tragic thing I've ever seen; it was horrible. \"We tried our best not to let it affect us. We tried to really concentrate, and focus on the boxing instead, but my heart goes out to those involved. \"What happened was a terrible, terrible, terrible event. I'm really sorry for the people involved. \"I was stuck in the Houses of Parliament for nine hours, so it was quite tiring. When I got back I went straight to bed.\" Super-heavyweight Clarke, 25, also suffered a second-round knockdown but recovered to earn a split decision against Guido Vianello. He said: \"It was the atmosphere: everyone's talking about it, I couldn't get away from it. \"But I'm not the victim, I was able to box; the victims were yesterday. \"If we can't get in there and fight after what we saw, how does everyone who was there get on with their lives? Police officers lost colleagues, families, friends. We were the lucky ones so we had every reason to get in there and put a show on. \"I said my little bit in there, 'Rest in peace and God be with'. I don't need closure. The families need closure; the colleagues. The mother that has to look after the children. They're the ones that it's impacting, not me. \"Everything's gone through my head. But someone was looking down on us; we didn't go out there (in time to be caught up in the attack). God willing, thank God, we were fine.\" The fourth of the Lionhearts' five wins was secured by Pantaleev, over Gianluca Rosciglione. It emerged earlier on Thursday that PC Palmer had long been a Charlton season-ticket holder, and that the League One club have planned a tribute to him. A scarf has been laid on his seat at The Valley, and will remain there until their next home fixture against MK Dons on April 4.","title":"Lionhearts boxers shaken but happy to fight on after

A group of women, who said they were wearing blue as a symbol of hope, stood holding hands for five minutes on Westminster Bridge as Big Ben chimed 4pm on Sunday. People from a range of backgrounds joined the event, organised by Women's March On London. Three members of the public died and many more were injured after Khalid Masood sped along the bridge before storming the parliamentary estate and stabbing to death a police officer. Fariha Khan, 40, a GP from Surbiton, said: \"The feeling of what happened here on Wednesday was really strong. \"We thought of the ordinary people who were here and were mown down, standing here like this, it was very overwhelming.\" She was joined by fellow Ahmadiyya Muslims who said they wanted to add to the condemnation of the violent attack and stand defiant in the face of terrorism. Sarah Waseem, 57, from Surrey, said: \"When an attack happens in London, it is an attack on me. \"It is an attack on all of us. Islam totally condemns violence of any sort. This is abhorrent to us.\" Being present for the demonstration shows people in the city are united in support of democracy, said Ayesha Malik. The 34-year-old mother-of-two, also from Surrey, said: \"As a visible Muslim I think it was important to show solidarity with the principles that we all hold dear, the principles of plurality, diversity and so on.\" Londoner Mary Bennett said she was present to make a \"small gesture\". The retired healthcare worker said: \"I am here to show that in a quiet way we continue to go where we like and do what we like in London. \"This is my city. It's a very small gesture but life is made up of small gestures.\" Comments & Moderation Readers’ comments: You are personally liable for the content of any comments you upload to this website, so please act responsibly.

The Houses of Parliament were regarded as a trophy target for terrorists. An ugly ribbon of steel and concrete sprang up, aimed at preventing a suicide bomber with a truck bringing carnage to the heart of London. The loser who set out intent on mass murder at Westminster used instead a weapon as commonplace as it is deadly: a car, driven at speed into crowds of tourists and Londoners. They were the softest of targets. As a city, as a nation and as a world, we must accept that those who seek to trample on our liberal, open and tolerant way of life will turn increasingly to such rudimentary tactics. And we need to move swiftly to protect the crowds who sightsee, stroll and pose for selfies in the tourist heartland of London. As attacks in Nice, Berlin and now London have demonstrated, cars and trucks are as potentially lethal as bombs and Kalashnikovs — but far easier to procure, and therefore presenting an incalculable risk to the people who congregate in the great cities of the world. Westminster Bridge is the busiest tourist thoroughfare in Britain, connecting Parliament Square and Westminster Abbey with the London Eye and the other visitor attractions on the South Bank. At any hour during the day hundreds of visitors crowd the pavements and point their cameras, charmed by the miscellany of monuments in the centre of western Europe’s biggest city. Westminster attack: What we know so far To mangle Wordsworth’s early 19th-century view of Westminster Bridge, Earth has much to show more fair than the awkward, if endearing, muddle where SE1 meets SW1. Yet in one sense we must turn the clock back to around 1802, a time without motorised transport. Buses, taxis and bikes, of course, must flow across the Thames. But we need to learn from Brussels, which suffered so badly exactly a year earlier. The main thoroughfare that previously carved from north to south has been closed to normal traffic, and life at the core of the Belgian capital is returning to walking (or cycling) pace.

With the greatest of respect to him and the brave men and women who serve with him, we must urgently plan for a city with humanity at its heart.

{"originalUrl":"https://wayback.archive.org/web/20170323224205/https://www.rt.com/news/382070-westminster-attack-difficult-ethical-questions/","text":"London terror attack asks uncomfortable questions of MSM In the immediate aftermath of the terror attack in London, issues related to the 24-hour news cycle, the proliferation of smartphones, and ethical boundaries when sharing graphic information online have all come under intense scrutiny. Every smartphone user is now a potential citizen journalist, and the urge to be first and share as much information as possible with the wider public can compel ordinary people and journalists alike to take action without sufficient restraint. In the chaos of the immediate aftermath, several major MSM outlets were criticized for their coverage of the events, which included graphic, unobscured images and videos of the victims of the attack. While social media platforms do have content filters in place, the sheer volume of graphic content shared in the wake of the attacks caused the questionable content to be shared far and wide on both legacy and digital media, with little to no filtering. One such victim of the intense desire to be the first to break a story was the UK’s Channel 4 News, which mistakenly reported the name of the alleged attacker as a man who was, in fact, still in prison when the events took place. Channel 4 News issued a retraction and apologized, but the incident further highlighted the precarious nature of journalism in the digital age. Several MSM digital media outlets persisted with the editorial decision to publish graphic images of the victims on Thursday, which once again focuses the spotlight on both the producers and consumers of online news in a metrics-driven industry. Unsurprisingly, with such emotive events still unfolding, many online used the attacks as a platform to further their own agenda.","title":"London terror attack asks uncomfortable questions of MSM —

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/janelytvynenko/heres-the-misinformation-spreading-about-the-london-attack?utm_term=.vu8pgNQY69#.vu8pgNQY69","text":"The Metropolitan police said they are treating the incident as a “terrorist attack\". As is often the case, misinformation began circulating quickly after the attack. 1. Britain's Channel 4 reported that a man named Abu Izzadeen is the suspect in the attack, but he was jailed a year ago. Sources confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Izzadeen is still in prison. The network has since retracted its claim. 3. One tweet of a screenshot from Al Jazeera's live Facebook coverage said \"the Muslim world\" is laughing at the London attack. It's difficult to know whether the screenshot is real, but it is possible to see all the reactions a video got on Facebook. Al Jazeera's video shows a very small minority of viewers \"laughed\" at the video. Facebook / Al Jazeera English Because it's possible to keep clicking the reaction button to flood the screen with emojis, there's no way of knowing whether one person reacted or 80. There's also no way of knowing where viewers clicking the emoji are from. 4. An interview with Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, in which he said terrorist attacks are \"part and parcel\" of life in big cities, has been taken out of context. The interview was published in September 2016. In it, Khan said large cities “have got to be prepared for these sorts of things”, adding: \"It is my job to try to make sure that we are as safe as we can be.” 5. In what has become a recurring hoax, comedian Sam Hyde has once again been falsely called the suspect.","title":"Here's The Misinformation Spreading About The London

{"originalUrl":"https://thetigertimes.com/2017/03/30/attack-occurs-on-london-in-westminster/","text":"Attack Occurs on London in Westminster On 22 March 2017, at approximately 2:40 p.m., an attacker drove a car over Westminster Bridge, killing at least 2 pedestrians and injuring numerous others. The attacker drove a car into the railing outside of the Houses of Parliament. The attacker was armed with a knife and killed unarmed officer P.C. Keith Palmer before being shot dead by armed forces. London, along with the rest of the world, were sent into panic when news of the attack broke. Seven people were left in critical condition while twenty-nine others were taken and treated by a hospital. Three of the injured were police officers who were pedestrians on the Westminster bridge at the time of the attack, two of whom were left in serious condition. Other victims were Britons as well as tourists and students from other nations, including France, Romania, South Korea, Greece, Germany, Poland, the Irish Republic, China, Italy, and the United States. The attacker was a British born man and is thought to have acted alone. His name is yet to be released.

Sadiq Khan FINALLY responds to London terror attack after being slammed for ‘silence' MAYOR of London Sadiq Khan has responded to the London terror attack, vowing Londoners \"will not be cowed by terrorism\" after being criticised for his \"deafening silence\" after five people were killed in Westminster. Related articles “My heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones and to everyone who has been affected. “Tragically, a Metropolitan Police officer who was doing his duty protecting out city is amongst those who have been killed and my thoughts are with his family this evening. “I want to express my gratitude, on behalf of all Londoners, to the police and emergency services who have shown tremendous bravery in exceptionally difficult circumstances. “I have spoken to the Acting Commissioner Metropolitan Police Commissioner Craig Mackay and national lead for Counter-Terrorism Policing and Acting Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley and remain in close contact with them. “Londoners should be aware that there will be additional armed and unarmed police officers on our streets from tonight in order to keep Londoners, and all those visiting out city safe. “I want to reassure all Londoners, and all our visitors, not to be alarmed. Our city remains one of the safest in the world. “London is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. “We always have and we always will. Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.” Hours earlier the Mayor was criticised for his \"deafneing silence\" after issuing a brief statement before Scotland Yard confirmed the fatalities in today’s atrocity. Scotland Yard confirmed the deaths shortly before 6pm, but Mr Khan’s office remained silent until 7.30pm pointing to their earlier statement made hours earlier.

Police are treating the incident, which left three people injured, as a potential terrorist attack. President Trump’s response was quick and followed his usual pattern: He fired off an early-morning tweet about “another terrorist attack” in London, comparing the suspect to an animal. Another terrorist attack in London...These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength! A sense of deja vu is understandable. A little over a year ago, a similar attacker — using a vehicle and then a knife — killed five people and injured more than 50 others outside the Houses of Parliament and the adjacent Westminster Bridge. Trump also tweeted (twice) about that attack — among the 46 tweets mentioning “terror” he made in 2017. Despite such high-profile attacks and responses, however, statistics released this month by the University of Maryland suggest that 2017 was the third consecutive year that the number of terrorist attacks around the world — and the deaths caused by them — had dropped. So far, 2018 looks on track to be lower still. The university’s Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) program found there were 10,900 terrorist attacks around the world last year, which killed a total of 26,400 people, including perpetrators. That was a drop from 2016, which was in turn a drop from 2015. Right now, the number of terrorist attacks and deaths from terrorism appears to have peaked in 2014, when there were nearly 17,000 attacks and more than 45,000 victims. What explains the downward trend? In Western Europe, where the number of attacks increased slightly in 2017 — but the number of victims dropped by 65 percent — it may be matters of policing and counterintelligence. British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that the country had foiled 13 Islamist terrorism plots and four far-right plots since March 2017, when last year’s attack near the Houses of Parliament occurred. On a global scale, however, the answer is clear. Though there was a surge in terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, most attacks still occur in the Middle East and Africa, and those regions saw a big decline in 2017. The number of terrorist attacks in the Middle East and North Africa dropped by 38 percent year on year according to START; the number of victims declined by 44 percent. That can largely be attributed to the Islamic States' loss of territory and military defeats throughout 2017. Without a stable base, the number of attacks the jihadist group could stage in countries like Iraq and Syria dropped sharply, as did the damage it could inflict on civilian populations. Indeed, it was largely thanks to the rise of the Islamic State and other extremist groups like Boko Haram that 2014 became such a remarkable year for global terrorism in the first place. In 2015, the Institute for Economics and Peace released a report that found there was an 80 percent increase in the number of deaths from terrorism in just one year — and the number of deaths from terrorism in 2014 was ninefold what it had been in 2000. But a closer read of the 2014 statistics paints a nuanced picture. START’s data from the year found just three countries — Iraq, Nigeria and Afghanistan — accounted for 60 percent of deaths from terrorism. Even though the total number of deaths globally from terrorism that year was clearly terrible (more than 45,000, according to START), it was still less than the number of deaths due to drug overdoses that same year in the United States alone. The United States was largely spared from the worst of this global increase in terrorism — START found 27 deaths in the country from terrorism in 2014, which included perpetrators. But terrorism has still shaken American politics. A Pew poll from July 2016, for example, found that voters thought that terrorism should get more time than any other subject in presidential debates. It’s too early to say whether 2018 will continue the encouraging trend of the past three years. Another monitoring group, Jane’s IHS Markit, has warned that there may be a surge in attacks in Europe as Islamic State fighters return from the Middle East. Notably, on Tuesday, two separate reports suggested the number of fighters still with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is considerably higher than previously estimated. But a bigger question is whether we can even know that terrorism is declining. Measuring global terrorism is a complicated task: START is one of only a handful of projects that strives to monitor it on a global level (Jane’s, mentioned above, is another). For the past six years, the State Department provided funding to START, effectively subcontracting the job of data collection on terrorism. But Erin Miller, the program manager for START’s Global Terrorism Database, said in an email that her team has been told the State Department did not renew its contract. Though the team is now seeking alternative funding, Miller said, there are currently no plans to publish data for 2018. In its place, we may be left with more unscientific, emotional measures of global terrorism.

He was a wonderful dad and wonderful husband to his wife. He was fun, he was a laugh, he cared.” Meanwhile, on Thursday morning outside PC Keith Palmer's home, a quiet suburban road in Welling, the only sign of the horror caused by the terror attack was the police gathered outside the heroic officer's front door. It is understood PC Palmer's family were home but too upset to speak to anyone outside the family. Neighbours of the 48-year-old, who was stabbed by a terrorist outside Parliament yesterday, expressed their shock at the news. It came after acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley confirmed Pc Palmer, a father-of-two who was a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Squad, had sadly died, despite the efforts of paramedics and Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood to save him. Speaking outside Scotland Yard after the attack on Wednesday, he said: “Today in Westminster we saw tragic events unfold and our thoughts are with those who lost loved ones, those who were injured and all those affected by this attack. \"One of those who died today was a police officer, Pc Keith Palmer, a member of our parliamentary and diplomatic protection command. Keith, aged 48, had 15 years' service and was a husband and father. \"He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen.” The bravery of the officer was later hailed by colleagues, friends and the many MPs whom he was charged with protecting. Conservative MP James Cleverly, a former colleague, was one of many who paid tribute to the \"lovely man\" he had known for a quarter of a century. He wrote of the 48-year-old father and husband: \"I've known Keith for 25 years. We served together in the Royal Artillery before he became a copper. \"A lovely man, a friend. I'm heartbroken. My thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Pc Keith Palmer. A brave man.\" The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, joined those sending prayers and thoughts to the family of Pc Palmer. He also acknowledged the work of many members of the public \"who pitched in and did what they needed to do, when faced with things for which they had never been trained or prepared\".","title":"'He
