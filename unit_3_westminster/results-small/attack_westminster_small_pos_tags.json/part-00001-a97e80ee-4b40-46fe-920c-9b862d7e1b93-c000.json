Why was PC Palmer unarmed? PC Palmer was unarmed when his knife-wielding attacker struck. Explaining why he didn't have a gun despite being charged with guarding Parliament, Mark Rowley, said: \"Our parliamentary protection team are a combination of armed and unarmed officers doing different roles, and sadly the officer who lost his life today was unarmed. \"He was supported by armed colleagues who shot and killed the attacker. \"[The attacker] tried to enter Parliament and was stopped at the gate.\" I've known Keith for 25 years. We served together in the Royal Artillery before he became a copper. A lovely man, a friend. I'm heartbroken. https://t.co/LgF4rQ7Vmg Home Affairs Select Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper, who was in the Palace of Westminster when the terrorist burst through the gates, said: \"Thank you PC Keith Palmer - to your bravery many others owe their lives and safety\". Labour MP Barry Gardiner was also caught up in the lockdown and posted a picture of armed police moving through Parliament.","title":"Who was Keith Palmer?

{"originalUrl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/this-is-the-man-behind-the-westminster-attack?utm_term=.snV08oddQq","text":"Khalid Masood, the man who attacked parliament this week, was born Adrian Elms in Dartford, Kent, on Christmas Day in 1964. He was also later known as Adrian Russell Ajao, after the man his mother married. The 52-year-old killed three pedestrians by driving into them on Westminster Bridge and injured 50 others before fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot by police on Wednesday. Shortly after the attack, police confirmed it was being investigated as a terrorist incident. Masood had a string of criminal convictions and was known to MI5. By Friday, police had made 11 arrests in connection with the attack, but continue to investigate whether he acted alone. Searches have been carried out at addresses in Brighton, southeast London, east London, Surrey, Manchester, Carmarthenshire, and Birmingham. Masood had been investigated “some years ago” as part of an investigation into violent extremism, prime minister Theresa May told MPs on Thursday. But despite a history of violent criminal offences he was only ever seen as \"peripheral\" in historical terror investigations. It is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday. A former intelligence official told BuzzFeed News: \"The service had him as an SOI [subject of interest] a few years ago but think he didn't meet the threshold for investigation so was not investigated further.\" They added: \"My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he's acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint.\" Metropolitan police Khalid Masood The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \"Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.” Masood’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He was also convicted of GBH, assaults, and public order offences, but nothing terrorism-related. In 2000, while living in the village of Northiam, Sussex, Masood, still known then as Elms, was convicted for slashing a man’s face after an argument in a pub. The victim, Piers Mott, was left needing stitches, and Elms was jailed for two years. Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott. This was a long time ago. I remember Elms being a bit of a troubled character.” Three years later Masood was accused of stabbing a man in the nose in Eastbourne, and was jailed for six months for possession of an offensive weapon. It is understood Masood had a partner and several children, including a 5-year-old boy. A marriage certificate seen by BuzzFeed News showed he married a woman called Farzana Malik in Medway, Kent, in 2004. While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal. The flat was raided by anti-terror police at 11pm on Wednesday night after the attack. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News The block of flats where Masood lived most recently in Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham. A next-door neighbour who gave her name as Iwona, 45, said he had lived there for seven months. \"I am really surprised, I cannot believe it, I cannot believe it,” she told BuzzFeed News. “As I said, when I saw him I couldn't even think someone could do something like this. Now I am scared, someone like this living close to me. “Sometimes in the afternoon I saw him taking care of the garden, washing the car, and he was very calm.\" Iwona described the woman he lived with there as being in her thirties and said she wore \"Islamic clothing\". The neighbour said she hadn't seen Masood for a few months and that he just \"took a van and went\". Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. \"The family moved quickly and took their things out of the garage,\" Iwona said. Aisha Gani / BuzzFeed News / Via BuzzFeed News Masood's neighbour Iwona at her flat in Quayside, Birmingham. Another neighbour, who gave her name as Sam, said: “He moved out in December and I never really spoke to him. I didn't know his name before. “He had a little boy who was 5 years old. There was a woman – I didn't know if it was his wife or daughter. We’d just say hello in the street.” It was in Birmingham that Masood hired the Hyundai Tucson from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car that he used in his fatal attack, reportedly telling staff he was a teacher. The Department for Education said Masood never held qualified status as a teacher, but according to The Sun newspaper he claimed on his CV to have an economics degree and to be a “senior English teacher” at a TEFL college in Luton in 2009. The Sun also said Masood travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2005, where he taught English, but this has yet to be verified. It is not known when Masood converted to Islam, or changed his name, although he stopped using his birth name on the electoral roll from at least 2009. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, the prime minister confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”. Echoing police, she said the “working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology”. After leaving Birmingham this week, Masood travelled to Brighton, where he spent Tuesday night in the Preston Park Hotel. Its manager Sabeur Toumi told Sky News Masood gave no indication of what was to happen the next day. “He was just like any other guest who checks into the hotel,\" he said. \"We had a brief conversation about where he came from in Birmingham. “He talked about his family, his mum, his dad, his wife. He said his dad was ill and his mum was upset.” Janet Ajao, Masood's mother, was last night reportedly too upset to speak to reporters from her home in rural Wales. On Friday the earliest picture of Masood, then known as Adrian Ajao, emerged. It showed him as a teenager at school in Tunbridge Wells, posing after a charity football match. Huntleys School website “I am really, really shocked. He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. The picture of us in the football team was after we did a 24-hour sponsored football match to raise money for the sports hall,” said Stuart Knight, who went to school with Masood, to TheGuardian. “We would have been about 14 years old. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital. After crashing the car into a fence outside the Palace of Westminster, Masood ran into the parliamentary estate through an open gate, fatally stabbing 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, a father and husband, before being shot by police.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) The Latest: UK honors lawmaker who tried to save policeman Mar. 24, 2017 A lawmaker who battled to save the life of a police officer stabbed in the Parliament attack has been honored with an appointment as an adviser to Queen Elizabeth II. British Prime Minister Theresa May's office says Tobias Ellwood has been named to the Privy Council, a committee of senior lawmakers, judges and others that advises the queen. The institution dates back a millennium, and members are entitled to be addressed as \"Right Honorable.\" Security Minister Ben Wallace, who helped coordinate the government response to Wednesday's attack, has also been named to the Privy Council. Ellwood, a former army officer whose brother died in the 2002 Bali bombing, gave mouth-to-mouth-resuscitation to Constable Keith Palmer after he was stabbed by attacker Khalid Masood as he was guarding the Parliament. Palmer died of his injuries. ___ 8:05 p.m. British police say six of the 10 people being held in connection with the attack near Britain's Parliament have been released without charge. The two women and four men were all arrested in the central England city of Birmingham, where attacker Khalid Masood recently lived. All had been arrested on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. Four other people remain in custody as police try to learn how Masood became radicalized and went on a rampage Wednesday in London with an SUV and knives that killed four people. He was later shot to death by police. Al-Hilli expressed his condolences Friday for the four people killed and dozens wounded in the car and knife rampage on Wednesday, saying \"we utterly condemn this terrorist act.\" Mirvis played on the theme of unity among people of faith, saying \"Londoners are showing right now that we will always stand up with strength to confront terror and we will never be cowed by it.\" ___ 2:50 p.m. Prince Charles has visited people injured in the London attack, meeting privately with victims at a hospital. The heir to the British throne thanked staff at King's College Hospital for their \"marvelous efforts.\" He shook hands with nurses, who took photos of him as he left the ward. Charles said: \"How you do it, I don't know.\" The hospital has treated eight victims. ___ 2:30 p.m. Romania's embassy in Britain says a Romanian woman wounded during a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge is showing signs of improvement although she remains in a serious condition. Romanian officials have not identified the woman, who fell into the Thames River when a SUV plowed into pedestrians on Wednesday, citing privacy regulations. Friends have identified her as Andreea Cristea, an interior designer, from the Black Sea port of Constanta. The embassy said Friday any further health updates would need to be approved by her family. Ambassador to Britain Dan Mihalache said on Thursday she underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from her brain. The embassy said her boyfriend has been discharged from the hospital. ___ 2:20 p.m. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has joined other Londoners in leaving floral tributes to honor the police officer killed in the London terror attack. Khan's note and flowers were placed outside of New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Force. Khan's note said: \"You will always be in our hearts. Londoners will never forget the innocent people who lost their lives.\" British Transport Police officers from Lambeth, South London left a note that said simply: \"For Pc Keith Palmer. HERO. Never forgotten.\" Palmer was stabbed to death by an attacker on Wednesday as he guarded the British Parliament in the heart of London. ___ 12:10 p.m. A former British Army officer told the BBC on Friday that rescuers held the hand of Constable Keith Palmer and talked to him as they tried in vain to save his life after he was stabbed during the attack on Parliament. Mike Crofts, a former Army captain who served in Afghanistan, said he was in the courtyard outside the Houses of Parliament following a meeting with politicians about using boxing to engage young men when the attack took place. \"Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were unable to save him,\" Crofts said. \"(Police Constable) Palmer at the time was surrounded by a whole host of colleagues who really loved him. We held his hand through the experience. We talked to him throughout, but unfortunately he passed away.\" ___ 11:30 a.m. The manager of a hotel where the London attacker stayed the night before he plowed his 4x4 into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then stabbed a police officer at Parliament says he seemed unusually outgoing and mentioned details about his family, including having a sick father. \"He was normal, in fact friendly, because we spent possibly five or 10 minutes talking to him about his background and where he came from,\" Sabeur Toumi told Sky News on Friday. Police raided the room at the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton after the attack, searching for clues about Khalid Masood, who was identified Friday by his prior name, Adrian Russell Ajao. Toumi said Masood checked in under his own name and mentioned having a couple of children, as well as troubles with an ailing father. Among the items seized were the trouser press and the toilet paper holder. ___ 10:15 a.m. He was the perfect British bobby, patiently and politely posing for a photo with a family of tourists from Australia, a wry smile on his face. Keith Palmer, the policeman stabbed to death in the Westminster attack on Wednesday, left a lasting warm impression on the Thorogoods on that day last October, as he willingly posed with the family for a picture. Parliament, the building that Palmer was guarding when he was murdered, was in the background. In a post on his Facebook page , Andrew Thorogood recalled how happy Palmer was \"to pose with us for a photo once he learned that we had travelled all the way from Alice Springs.\" Describing Palmer as \"a genuinely nice bloke,\" Thorogood recalled that the officer \"said he would love to visit Australia with his family one day.\" Thorogood added that \"he was happy to chat and smile for a photo ... whilst still remaining vigilant and carrying out his duties as a police officer.\" ___ 8:30 a.m. London's top terror officer says Khalid Masood, who attacked Britain's Parliament, killing four people and wounding some 50, was born Adrian Russell Ajao. Counter-terror chief Mark Rowley revealed the name in a briefing Friday outside Scotland Yard in which he also said there were two other significant arrests. That brought the total number of people in custody for the Wednesday attack to nine. The attacker was born in southeastern England and had most recently been living in the central city of Birmingham. ___ 8:20 a.m. London's top anti-terror officer says two more \"significant arrests\" have been made in connection with the Westminster attack, in central and northern England. Nine people are currently in custody, while one has been released on bail. Counter-terror chief Mark Rowley on Friday also identified the latest victim, who died in the hospital on Thursday, as 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from Streatham, south London. The attacker, identified as Khalid Masood, drove his car into crowds of people on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon, killing three and wounding some 50, before stabbing a police officer to death at the Houses of Parliament. He was shot dead by police.","title":"The Latest: UK honors lawmaker who tried to save

{"originalUrl":"https://heconvention2.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/made-in-westminster/","text":"Made in Westminster: The source of the USS ‘crisis’ – and the solution [The USS ‘crisis’] is the result of the misrepresentation of the finances of the USS, and the desire of a new breed of university managements to cut their pension liabilities and thereby ease the financing of new buildings and campuses. Successive Pension Acts have encouraged managers of private sector schemes to exaggerate the risks of default. Combined with Quantitative Easing, this has led to a headlong abandonment of Final Salary Defined Benefit to “Defined Contribution” schemes, where employees rather than employers bear investment risk. Higher Education today is shaped by frantic competition for students and huge building projects. Universities can recruit unlimited UK undergraduates paying an annual £9,000 plus, backed by taxpayer loans. The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 even allows universities to go bankrupt. Much of this argument will be familiar to colleagues. The debate about the University Superannuation Scheme (USS) deficit has been an active subject of discussion on campuses since last summer when the press first announced that the pension scheme was at risk. Initial press claims were of a deficit of £17.5bn, while at exactly the same time USS themselves reassured pensioners that the scheme was in surplus. But it is worth considering the source of this deficit in more detail than the Guardian letter’s pages will permit. Is the deficit real, as the employers and USS themselves have asserted, or is it an accounting artefact, as the UCU trade union has claimed? This is a key question, of course. Most important of all, until we know the source of the deficit we cannot begin to propose solutions. We will turn to these shortly. First we need to summarise briefly the methodology that is used for valuing USS. How USS is valued The USS is obliged by the Pension Regulator, an arm of Government (technically, a ‘non-departmental public body’), to triennially review the valuation of its assets and future liabilities. Future liabilities are estimated on the basis of a number of actuarial assumptions, including life expectancy for men and women, projections of wage and consumer price inflation, and so on. Several of these assumptions have been criticised for over-estimating the liabilities. Small changes in assumptions can have very large consequences thanks to the effect of compound interest. In the most recent valuation, it has been the method for valuing the assets of the scheme that has been the focus of most public challenges. At the time of writing in February 2018, USS has its investments in some 70% stocks and shares, which are high yield but high risk, and around 10% in government stock and gilts: low yield and low risk. The remaining 20% or so is in a number of other investment vehicles. Over the last five years the investments have performed well, and the last Annual Report was able to boast that the assets had grown by an average of 12% per annum for the last five years to £60bn. One might think that the scheme should be valued in terms of the assets it holds. Suppose you own a house and you want to use your house value to ease your retirement. Your principal concern will be about the market value of that house in the future (and future remortgaging conditions). Working for UCU, First Actuarial examined USS’s actual assets, its income projections (contributions from the sector) and pension liabilities. They found that income and liabilities closely match for the next 40 years without touching the assets. Figure 1: Doing nothing is a genuine option: income (green) closely matches outgoings (blue) for the next 40 years with some modest assumptions. From Salt and Benstead (2017) Progressing the Valuation of USS. London: First Actuarial. That is, if no action were taken, USS would be able to pay its pensioners well into the future without even touching its assets. Its assets could therefore continue to be invested in a mixed portfolio, and (although past performance is no guarantee) grow at a rate exceeding inflation. Like the house buyer, they are not about to sell their house at current market prices. However, this is not how USS values its assets. Instead, the USS valuation uses a method called “self-sufficiency in gilts”. In the 2014 USS valuation this was sometimes referred to as a “Gilts+” methodology. A new test, “Test 1”, was introduced which placed further conditions on this valuation. But essentially the idea is as follows. Assume that USS closes tomorrow. In order to guarantee payments to pensioners it needs to shield assets from stock market variability. To do this, it moves its assets from the current mixed portfolio dominated by stocks and shares to government stocks and gilts (for reasons of brevity we will refer to a range of government stock investments as ‘gilts’, although technically the term applies more narrowly). This process is called “de-risking” because government stock is meant to be secure — far more stable than an individual stock price at least. It means selling stock at current prices and buying gilts, and predicting future gilt yields. Unfortunately gilt yields are very low, and likely to remain low, thanks to Quantitative Easing (see below) undermining the UK Government’s credit rating and sterling value. Crucially, they are likely to stay well below inflation for the near and long term. Note that this is a counterfactual assumption. Assets are still 70% invested in stocks and shares. It is not a model of the running of the scheme. It is a model of what would need to happen if the employers ceased to operate. If all universities went bankrupt tomorrow, staff would not be paid, and USS would receive no employer and employee contributions. The scheme would close, and would then have to pay out its liabilities. The obvious question has to be whether sectoral bankruptcy is a meaningful basis for valuing this pension scheme. (Note: some in the pensions industry are questioning whether it is a reasonable basis for valuing any pension scheme.) Private sector pension scheme regulations say that valuations must take place by modelling this scenario. In the case of single-employer schemes, the worst-case assumption is important. Employers like BHS and Carillion were the sole employer paying into their pension schemes. The single employer can declare bankruptcy, leaving the pension scheme to pay out entirely on its assets. But the 68 large pre-92 Higher Education institutions who are the principal members of USS are not a single employer. (USS cites 350 employer members, but most are small.) The model assumes all institutions go bankrupt simultaneously. This is an extraordinary assumption, one that in political terms can be said to have zero probability. That is, if the entire pre-92 university sector declared bankruptcy, I would contend that the government of the day would be faced with a political crisis of unprecedented scale, compelling them to intervene to protect staff, students and pensions. Moreover, if the government of today is genuinely envisaging this scenario, they have a political obligation to say so, and explain now what they will do about it! There has been no instance of a single bankruptcy of a pre-92 university since USS was established. Instead, universities have been obliged to merge, teach out courses and thereby transfer staff and students. Thus when University College Cardiff was in financial difficulty in 1987, it merged with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST, also in some difficulty) and the University of Wales College of Cardiff, to become Cardiff University. This means that even in cases of financial hardship for one institution the sector itself may continue to grow. The joint and several liability for the pension scheme means other employers pick up the tab, just as they grow market share. Let us consider the shocking scenario where a large Russell Group university declares bankruptcy. This is a more realistic possibility than sectoral closure. It is a scenario newly envisaged by the Higher Education and Research Act. Instead of being obliged to manage ‘institutional exit’, as the 2016 HE White Paper euphemistically called the process, the legislation now permits, in theory at least, an institution being permitted to shut down overnight. Worse, let us also assume that the Government takes a zero-intervention approach, and does not fund a gradual withdrawal from the undergraduate market. The exit of a large player from a market of many competing institutions may be a severe shock, causing (say) 10,000 USS active members to be without employment, and their contributions to cease. In 2017, USS had a total of 190,546 active members (those paying into their scheme). In the short term, USS would lose 5% of its income. Note: the figure of 10,000 reflects one of the big institutions like UCL. There are 68 pre-92 university employers out of the 350 participating employers. Considering only these employers would obtain an average of 2,802 active USS members per institution. But markets with many players can absorb market share relatively easily. Students will need to move somewhere, and staff will be required to teach them. Grant-funded research activity is hypothecated (funding is earmarked solely for that purpose) and much of it will relocate, with staff. So the redundancies will be absorbed by employment elsewhere. In other words, the obligation to share risk across the sector is, in fact, offset by the ability of institutions to absorb market share. None of the above is intended to be blasé about the human and social consequences of a large bankruptcy of this nature. Rather, it is to point out that for USS, these consequences should not be exaggerated. Yet exaggerating the risk of bankruptcy lies at the heart of this valuation model. The result of the USS valuation in September 2017 was the following distribution. Using a model of gradual de-risking over the next ten years, the mean projected deficit (‘the best estimate’) was £8.3 billion in surplus. The sketch below illustrates the principle. The distribution is approximately Normal, and symmetric. Sketch of the probability distribution of the difference between USS assets and liabilities projected on September valuation assumptions (gradual ‘de-risking’). The deficit is the lower bound of a 33% confidence interval of £8.3bn ± 13.4bn. (The standard deviation is an astounding £31bn). There is thus a one in three chance that the actual deficit will be more than £5.1bn. But there is a two in three chance that the deficit will be smaller than £5.1bn, or the scheme will be in surplus. Indeed, the zero point is 0.27 standard deviations below the mean, a probability of 0.21 of the area on the left hand side of the mean. There is a 60% chance that the assets will outstrip the liabilities, and a below 40% chance that (in the imaginary situation of gradual scheme shutdown), the assets will not meet the liabilities. Of course, this entire model hinges on the need to de-risk. What happens if the scheme de-risks immediately? The university employers’ federation Universities UK asked this question in November last year. Having consulted their members, they concluded that the sector would not like to carry the theoretical declining risk of a mixed portfolio for the next ten years, and would wish to model immediate de-risking. This obtained the following graph. Sketch of the probability distribution of the difference between USS assets and liabilities projected by November Technical Provisions (immediate ‘de-risking’). Again, the scheme is in surplus. But thanks to the fire-sale of assets and the greater exposure to the below-inflation value of gilts, the projected mean declines to £5.2bn. The lower bound of the 33% interval (0.43 standard deviations) is -7.5bn. The projection has become slightly more certain. Applying the same calculation as before, the chance of scheme default has increased from 39.5% to 43%. Indeed, conducting ‘de-risking’ under current market conditions is a sure-fire way to turn a projected deficit into an actual one. The actuarial term is extremely misleading. Actual de-risking is not only counterfactual, it would be an imprudent way to manage the pension scheme! Now that we have understood the valuation method currently in operation, we can consider the three causes outlined in our letter. Cause 1: The Pensions Acts and the Pension Regulator There have been a flurry of Pensions Acts since 2004. There were Pensions Acts in 2004, 2007, 2008 (which established automatic enrolment), 2011, 2014 and 2017. The key ones for our argument concern the office of the Pension Regulator. The Pension Regulator was established by the Pensions Act 2004. On paper, a Pensions Regulator is a good thing, attempting to ensure through intervention that private pension schemes are self-standing in the circumstances where an employer goes bankrupt. However, the regulatory requirements of the Pension Regulator primarily concern Defined Benefit schemes. These schemes have an “employer covenant”, a legal obligation for the employer to guarantee defined benefits should the employer go bankrupt. As bankrupts cannot pay bills, this duty means intervening in the valuation and regulation of live schemes. The Pension Regulator insists on cautionary estimates of pension scheme deficits. to minimise any adverse impact on the sustainable growth of sponsoring employers when exercising its functions relating to scheme funding. The Pension Regulator has a number of statutory obligations, the central one being of course to ensure that pension schemes do not fall into deficit. But the new statutory duty of 2014 places the commercial interests of sponsoring employers over the responsibility to fund private sector pension schemes. As Willis Towers Watson comment It will be important to think through arguments [for corporates] to defend against any methodologies which result in building in excessive prudence through the back door. The obvious point is that modelling a multi-employer pension scheme (especially one whose income stream is an hypothecated section of public sector finances) as if it were a single employer is absurd. Modelling any risk of default on a zero-probability event is to model a zero probability. The real chance of deficit is zero, unless USS themselves pull the plug and ‘de-risk’ the scheme. Indeed the way to risk deficit is to do precisely this. Therefore the Pension Regulator simply needs to accept that the valuation method being used is meaningless, and recognise that efforts to address a non-existent deficit risk are counter-productive. They are examples of ‘excessive prudence’. Cause 2: Quantitative Easing Quantitative Easing is the process whereby since the 2008 banking crisis, first Labour and then the Conservatives have increased money supply (‘printed money’) to bail out the banking sector. The current manifestation of QE is the retention by the Bank of England of artificially low interest rates. This has had the effect of pushing up the cost of buying gilts but depressing their rate of return (yield). Gilt yields increased after the vote to leave the EU, but to a peak of 1.1%. But this has been overtaken by inflation. The crucial factor for a pension fund is whether gilt yields exceed CPI. If all the assets are in gilts, any below-inflation growth is a real-terms decline in asset values. Inflation erodes the pension assets. This is precisely why early de-risking (despite its name) increases the chance of scheme default. Cause 3: The Higher Education and Research Act and its precursors Government HE policy since 2010 culminated in the Higher Education and Research Act 2017. This commenced with the introduction of £9,000 a year undergraduate fees and the partial abolition of the block grant (total abolition for Arts and Humanities). Universities found that they could make a tidy profit by ‘pile em high’ practices. But they were still restricted in the numbers of students they could recruit. This all changed with the removal in 2014 of caps on student numbers. Universities could now compete with each other for students, and market share. The first set of victims have been the post-92 universities, the ex-polytechnics, whose staff are not in the USS pension scheme. Students considering an expensive degree at London Metropolitan University, for example, now found places at King’s College. In London, LMU’s pain has been swiftly followed by that of Westminster University, currently engaged in serial cutbacks of staff. In this first wave, the USS employers have boomed. Indeed, the Higher Education Statistics Agency reports that sector surpluses rose by a factor of 10 from £158m in 2005/6 to £1.5bn in 2016/17. However, to accommodate the new student numbers, universities needed estate capacity. They started a major programme of investment in new buildings, campuses and student accommodation. To do this they needed to borrow. Whereas some initial loans may have been on favourable terms, as construction costs have increased, institutions have had to borrow on the open market. Of course, when you borrow in this way you have to declare your assets and your liabilities, including the liability toward the pension fund. It is this new obligation that I believe explains why, in the USS negotiations, UUK employers (led by the most expansionist Russell Group employers) focused on Defined Contribution, rather than, say, a worse Defined Benefit scheme. This is because a shift to Defined Contribution removes any future liability the employers have towards the stability of the scheme. It ends the employer covenant. Conclusion The fight over the USS pension is the first national dispute over the finances and shape of the UK Higher Education sector since the enactment of the Higher Education and Research Bill as an Act. Market competition and the new regulatory environment are causing employers to try to limit their liabilities and reduce their costs. One can read the specific solutions proposed by the employers as signifiers of their priorities towards staff more generally. When we wrote the Alternative White Paper for Higher Education, we did not predict that the first victim of the new HE regime would be university pensions. But the links between government policy, institutional behaviour and the USS ‘crisis’ are not hard to see. For decades USS was strong and stable. There is no evidence that any intrinsic factor has changed. USS has a set of internal regulations and parameters for managing stock market risk. There is no need to ‘de-risk’ the portfolio. The deficit is a projection under imagined conditions. It is counterfactual, and not real. To compound this observation, even in these impossible conditions the scheme is odds-on to achieve a surplus. The deficit that arises is an artefact of the scale of uncertainty assumed in the model. What has changed in the reporting of the scheme finances has been due to the pressure of the Pension Regulator to report finances on the mathematically incoherent ‘self sufficiency in gilts’ basis, and the impact of Quantitative Easing on this gilts-based modelling. All three of these extrinsic factors arise as a result of Government policy, whether they be Pension Acts, QE or the fees-and-loans market in education. If we want to fix the ‘crisis’ in the USS pension scheme, the rational solution is to address its causes directly. A compromise solution that leaves the valuation methodology in place invites future cuts in the scheme. We need to fix the problem at source. The Government could take any of the following steps: instruct the Pension Regulator to move deadlines, instruct the Pension Regulator to set aside the self-sufficiency valuation requirement, agree to act as guarantor of last resort until the next valuation cycle, opt to put money into the scheme / buy a stake in it, engage in full nationalisation. Given that the risk of scheme default is actually zero unless the USS Board order a disinvestment programme (choose to ‘de-risk’), for the Government to agree to act as a guarantor of last resort is an extraordinarily cheap intervention. Moreover, providing this assurance to scheme Trustees until the next valuation would also permit the National Audit Office to review the valuation methodology and propose rational alternatives. USS is required to value the scheme every 3 years and to do so in a way that considers long and short term, but it is not required to use the current approach. This is a crisis Made in Westminster — and the solution lies in Ministers’ hands. There is already an Early Day Motion 619 signed (at the time of writing) by 65 MPs. The problem and the solution lies in Westminster. It is time to resolve this dispute by preserving the scheme as-is. In the meantime, staff in universities are absolutely correct to strike. Unless they do, Government minds will not be concentrated. The main problem we faced in campaigning over the HE Bill was not that we did not convince senior Government figures of our analysis. It was that there was not a mass movement outside of Parliament to defend our Universities. A reasonable valuation of the assets taking into account the plural nature of employing institutions is of course a big issue, but the calculation of the liabilities needs also to be taken into account. Final salary scheme pensions are calculated based on the best year in a period of some 12 years prior to retirement updated by inflation (CPI now rather than the previous RPI). University staff salaries have been held down to well below both measures of inflation for a decade or more. This means in the coming years the salary base used in pensions calculations of many staff with significant years of service will actually begin to fall reducing, not increasng, USS liabilities for those staff. As many in universities and some vice chancellors (e.g. Imperial and Edinburgh) have now been suggesting it is essential that a fair and transparent valuation of assets on a proper considered basis (not some simplified worst case scenario) and the liabilities (using the real data on salaries) is done by some group able to do a proper evidence and data based analysis, not using some unbelievable formulaic approach. This needs to be thorough, detailed and transparent so it is accepted by all sides before any change is made to the current USS scheme so soon after the recent significant changes. The evidence base will also be needed if challenges to regulator formulae or government rules are necessary. In terms of the liabilities calculation it is a mix of previous and current schemes Sean… but my point, as I am sure you realise, is that a proper calculation is needed ased on real data and not some simplistic and silly formulaic one.","title":"Made in Westminster – Sean Wallis | The Convention for Higher

{"originalUrl":"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/funeral-held-for-romanian-tourist-killed-in-westminster-terror-attack-35710984.html","text":"A funeral service has taken place for a Romanian tourist thrown into the Thames when an extremist ploughed into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge. Andreea Cristea, 31, was knocked into the river when Khalid Masood drove his rented car into pedestrians on March 22 and died two weeks later. Her boyfriend, Andrei Burnaz, suffered a broken foot. Masood rushed on to the grounds of Parliament, where he fatally stabbed a policeman before being shot dead by another officer. Dozens of mourners attended the service at the St Mary's church on Saturday near the dockyards in the city in Constanta in eastern Romania, near the sea that she loved. The Romanian couple were on a short break to celebrate the birthday of Mr Burnaz, who had been planning to propose to Miss Cristea. About 150 mourners carrying flickering candles gathered at the church wearing badges with her photo which said: \"Forever in my heart!\" Two heart-shaped wreaths of white roses adorned her coffin. Orthodox Archbishop Teodosie of Tomis headed a group of priests who wafted incense during the service, much of which was sung. Miss Cristea was pulled from the Thames and later had surgery for a blood clot on the brain. She died on April 6 when life support was withdrawn. She was the fifth victim of Masood, a 52-year-old former inmate who had embraced radical Islam. Dozens more were wounded in the rampage. Mr Teodosie called Miss Cristea \"young, beautiful, hard-working and full of love\" and that \"a destiny that was about to take flight had its wings cut,\" alluding to the forthcoming proposal from Mr Burnaz, an engineer who stood quietly during the service and wept occasionally. After her death, her family and Mr Burnaz described Miss Cristea as \"our shining ray of light that will forever keep on shining in our hearts,\" and said they would donate all the money raised on her

Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA British police have named Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old from the Birmingham area, as the man who carried out Wednesday’s attack at Westminster in which four other people died. On Thursday night, Scotland Yard said a 75-year-old man who was injured in the attack has died in hospital bringing the death toll to five including the attacker. Masood, who was shot dead during the attack, was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was also known by a number of aliases, police said in a statement. Scotland Yard said Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack. However, he was known to police and had a range of previous convictions for assaults including grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He has not been convicted for any terrorism offences. Five people were killed, including the attacker, and 40 people were injured during Wednesday’s attack near the British parliament in Westminster, the worst of its kind in the UK for more than a decade. One Irish person was among the 40 people injured which also included 12 Britons, three French, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Chinese, one Italian and two Greeks. Police said seven of the 40 injured people were in a critical condition. The injuries suffered by the Irish person are not considered life-threatening, Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald told the Dáil. Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan said his department had offered and was ready to provide consular assistance to the injured person. The Islamic State group said through its Aaamaq news agency that Masood was a “soldier” of the group. Dozens of people were knocked down by his car before he got out and stabbed policeman Keith Palmer to death inside the grounds of the British parliament on Wednesday. Eight people, three women and five men, have been arrested in London and Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts, Scotland Yard said. Policeman Keith Palmer (48) and three civilians were killed in the attack. Masood also died after he was shot by police officers. Aysha Frade (43) and Kurt Cochran, an American tourist visiting from Utah, died in the attack while Mr Cochran’s wife Melissa was also injured and remains in hospital. Ms Frade, a mother of two, worked as a teacher at DLD College in London and had family in the northwestern Spanish town of Betanzos. It is believed she was walking from the school where she taught when she was hit by the car driven by the attacker. ‘Attack on people everywhere’ Prime minister Theresa May described Wednesday’s incident as “an attack on free people everywhere” and said the threat level remained “severe”. While the public should remain “utterly vigilant”, Ms May underlined “they should not and will not be cowed by this threat”. “We are stepping up policing to reassure the public and as a precautionary measure it will mean increasing patrols in cities across the country, with more police and more armed police on the scene.” Ms May also paid tribute to the bravery of the police at the scene on Wednesday. A spokesman for the prime minister later said Ms May’s plans to begin the formal process of leaving the EU on March 29th would not be delayed by the attack. ‘Acted alone’ Metropolitan Police senior anti-terror officer Mark Rowley said investigators still believed the attacker had acted alone and was “inspired by international terrorism”. “Clearly our investigation is ongoing – developing all the time – and is focused on his motivation, his preparation and associates.” Witnesses on Wednesday described seeing one of the victims injured in the attack being pulled from the river Thames. It has emerged the young woman pulled from the water was a Romanian tourist celebrating her boyfriend’s birthday in London. Italy’s ambassador to the UK Pasquale Terracciano said she had visited an Italian woman in hospital who lost consciousness for about 10 minutes after she was struck by the car’s bumper. The woman has undergone surgery for a compound leg fracture. A minute’s silence was held in parliament and in front of police headquarters at New Scotland Yard at 9.33am, in honour of the victims – 933 was the shoulder number on the uniform of PC Palmer. Although police have stressed there is no specific information to suggest any further threat to the public, officers will also be on heightened alert for any copy-cat incidents or further attacks. UK police and MI5, supported by GCHQ, have been conducting an unprecedented and largely successful operation to contain the threat. Intelligence agencies estimate there are around 3,000 potentially violent Islamist extremists in the UK, most of them British. Counter-terrorism units are carrying out more than 500 investigations at any one time and say they have foiled 13 potential attacks in less than four years. Meanwhile, a man was arrested in Belgium on Thursday after he tried to drive into a crowd at high speed in a shopping area of Antwerp. The driver, a man of north African origin, was arrested after a chase in the city centre. He was carrying weapons and military uniforms in the boot of the car, according to the RTFB state broadcaster. Pedestrians The incident in London began at around 2.40pm when a dark-coloured Hyundai i40 drove on to a pavement on Westminster Bridge. The Palace of Westminster was locked down within minutes, with MPs in the House of Commons chamber told to lie on the floor immediately after the attack. The commons was suspended but MPs had to remain in the chamber for four hours until the lockdown was lifted. As the dead and injured lay strewn on the ground, the vehicle crashed into a railing outside parliament, close to Big Ben. Masood ran from the car and through the gates of parliament, stabbing two policemen who tried to stop him. Armed officers shouted at Masood and then fired a number of shots. PC Palmer also died, despite an attempt by foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood and others to revive him and bind his stab wounds.","title":"Westminster attack: Fifth person dies as attacker

{"originalUrl":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5678193/metropolitan-police-neo-nazi-terrorist-plots-foiled-westminster-attack/","text":"Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley revealed that four terrorist plots involving right wing fanatics have been foiled since the Westminster attacks last March It compares to 10 Islamic terrorist conspiracies which were smashed by police and MI5 during the same period. In a worrying new trend, at least two of the foiled neo-Nazi plots involved a group of suspects, rather than lone wolves like Finsbury Park killer van driver Darren Osborne and nail bomber David Copeland. Police chief Mr Rowley singled out proscribed far right group National Action, saying “for the best part of 18 months in the UK, a home-grown white supremacist neo-Nazi terrorist organisation that eschews violence” has been active. “That should be a matter of grave concern to all of us,” he said in advance of delivering a keynote speech tonight. The four neo-Nazi plots foiled in the UK in the last year include 20-year-old Ethan Stables, a closet bisexual convicted last month of trying to launch a machete attack on a gay pride night held at a pub in his home town, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, last June. He was brainwashed by Nazi propaganda on the Internet and caught after posting a message on a far right Facebook page saying he was “going to war” and planned to “slaughter.” Other cases cannot be mentioned at this time for legal reasons. Police chief Mr Rowley described Internet propaganda as the “bloodstream that drives terrorism,” continuing: “The ability of terrorists and extremists to play their trade on the Internet is a matter of great concern.” Mr Rowley added: “The ease and speed in which vulnerable people can be radicalised through online propaganda and then move to attack planning has been a feature of many of our cases.” In his address to the Policy Exchange political think tank’s Colin Cramphorn Memorial lecture held in Central London, Mr Rowley said there were repeated examples of vulnerable people being exploited and influenced by extremist rhetoric to carry out attacks. Mr Rowley said Finsbury Park attacker, Darren Osborne “had grown to hate Muslims largely due to his consumption of large amounts of on-line far right material, including EDL leader Tommy Robinson, Britain First and others.” He went on: “Osborne had a dysfunctional background and history of alcohol, drug abuse and violence. Hate group National Action was banned by Amber Rudd in December last year “There can be no doubt that the extremist rhetoric he consumed fed into his vulnerabilities and turned it into violence.” Mr Rowley added that the two opposing strands of far right and Islamic extremism - spouted by hate preachers like Anjem Choudary - both used “a common strategy” of radicalisation and fed off each other. He said “both try to generate isolation, fear and hatred” and whip up community tensions.

{"originalUrl":"https://sputniknews.com/news/201703231051865337-westminster-attack-fifth-victim/","text":"At least 40 others were wounded in the attack. The attacker ran dozens of Londoners down on Westminster Bridge from inside his car, before leaping out and fatally attacking Palmer with a knife. \"I will not comment on this stage on the identity of the attacker but our working assumption is he was inspired by international terrorism,\" Acting Deputy Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police Mark Rowley said in a statement hours after the attacks. He also said that among the injured were \"three police officers, two of whom are in a serious condition,\" Australian broadcaster ABC reports. Police claim to know the identity of the assailant, who was reportedly shot dead, but have thus far refused to release it to the press. Police are treating the incident as a terrorist attack.

PC Keith Palmer was stabbed to death and two colleagues were injured. Seven people remain in a critical condition in hospital. Theresa May has also paid tribute to the victims. The Prime Minister said Parliament was sending out the message following Wednesday's attack by a knife-wielding terrorist that \"we will never waver in the face of terrorism\". An hour after MPs gathered at the usual time and stood for a minute's silence in honour of the innocent people killed in the attack, Mrs May said the actions of millions around the country showed terrorists \"we will never give in\". In a show of defiance, the PM told a packed Commons chamber: \"The greatest response lies not in the words of politicians, but in the everyday actions of ordinary people. \"For beyond these walls today, in scenes repeated in towns and cities across the country, millions of people are going about their days and getting on with their lives.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/07/romanian-tourist-hurt-in-london-attack-has-died.html","text":"Romanian tourist injured during London attack has died LONDON – A 31-year-old Romanian tourist who was knocked into the River Thames from Westminster Bridge during an attack on Britain's Houses of Parliament more than two weeks ago has died, London police said Friday. Andreea Cristea was rescued from the cold river after the attack, in which a man identified as Khalid Masood drove his rented SUV into pedestrians on the bridge and then fatally stabbed a police officer at the Houses of Parliament. Her boyfriend Andrei Burnaz suffered a broken foot in the attack. Her family and Burnaz described Cristea as \"our shining ray of light that will forever keep on shining in our hearts,\" and said they would be donating to charity all the money raised to help her since the March 22 attack. \"After fighting for her life for over two weeks, our beloved and irreplaceable Andreea — wonderful daughter, sister, partner, dedicated friend and the most unique and life-loving person you can imagine — was cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way,\" they said in a statement. They said there are no words to describe the emptiness they feel and thanked medical personnel for their round-the-clock help. More on this... Police said she had been receiving extensive treatment in the hospital since the attack but that life support was withdrawn Thursday afternoon. Footage taken at the time showed Cristea falling into the river during the attack. Witnesses saw her lying face-down in the Thames before she was rescued and rushed to an emergency room for emergency surgery after being diagnosed with a blood clot on the brain. Burnaz needed surgery on his foot but has been discharged from the hospital. He was seen in a wheelchair at a memorial service for victims held last week. The death toll from the attack now stands at five, including the police officer. The attacker was shot dead by police. Dozens more were wounded.

He then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament, left the vehicle and stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death as he stood on guard. Four days after the attack shook London, women from different backgrounds came together in solidarity to condemn the horrific crime and show unity in the face of terror. Many of those present were Muslim, wearing blue as a symbol of hope and peace.

{"originalUrl":"https://redice.tv/news/westminster-terrorist-attack-salih-khater-named-as-perpetrator","text":"Westminster Terrorist Attack: Salih Khater Named as Perpetrator The man arrested on suspicion of terror offences after a car crashed outside the Houses of Parliament has been named as Salih Khater by government sources. The 29-year-old British citizen, originally from Sudan, has also been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, Met Police said. He came to the UK as a refugee and was granted asylum, the BBC understands. His brother described him as a \"normal person\" with no fanatical ideas and no links to any religious group. Abdullah Khater also said his family - who are originally from Darfur in Sudan - were in \"a state of shock\". Three people were injured when the car hit cyclists and pedestrians during Tuesday morning's rush hour. The silver Ford Fiesta then crashed into security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament just before 07:40 BST. A man and a woman were taken to hospital after the crash and later discharged, while another man was treated for minor injuries at the scene. The suspect is not believed to have been known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police, but is understood to have been known to local police. He did not co-operate with officers after his arrest, Scotland Yard said. The investigation team's priority \"continues to be to understand the motivation behind this incident\", a spokesman added. Police have concluded searches of two properties in Birmingham and one in Nottingham, and are currently searching a third address in Birmingham. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said the reasons for the crash remained \"very open\" nearly 36 hours on. He said while detectives were holding Mr Khater on suspicion of terror offences, they had not yet formally declared the crash a terrorist incident, suggesting they had not yet found anything to link him to extremism. What else is known about the suspect? Khater came to Britain in 2010 and successfully applied for UK citizenship in the past two years. His brother said he had been planning a trip back home to see his family, having not seen them for some time. Khater is believed to have lived in a first-floor flat above a parade of shops in the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham until four months ago, when he moved to the city's Highgate area. Neighbours called him a quiet man who frequently visited an internet cafe and a nearby shisha lounge, both on Stratford Road. Local resident Ahmed Abdi described him as a man who \"never spoke to anybody\", and added: \"I recognised his picture from the news and I was shocked.\" Having completed his secondary education in Sudan, he studied electrical engineering at university there before moving to the UK. He studied English as a second or foreign language at City College from 2010 to 2011, later studying a diploma in science at South and City College in Birmingham from 2014 to 2017. More recently, Khater studied accountancy at Coventry University from September 2017 to May this year, a spokesman for the university said. He is no longer enrolled there. Members of the Sudanese community have suggested Mr Khater may have had an appointment in London at the Sudan embassy to obtain a visa for his trip. Birmingham Central Mosque said its inquiries with the community found he did not worship at the mosque and had showed no signs of radicalisation. In a CV seen by the BBC, Khater described himself as a \"hardworking, honest and polite individual\" and \"mature and responsible, with the ability to stay calm in high pressured situations\". It says he worked in Libya for two years as a farm labourer before coming to the UK. The BBC understands Khater did spend time in Libya before travelling to Britain, but has not confirmed the exact timeframe. The CV also suggests he spent time as a security guard in Nottingham.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.pfoa.co.uk/blog/cop-paralysed-in-westminster-terror-attack-can-finally-put-kids-to-bed-again","text":"Cop paralysed in Westminster terror attack can finally put kids to bed again A police officer paralysed in the Westminster terror attack is finally able tuck his kids into bed again thanks to the DIY SOS squad. Hundreds of volunteers helped completely refurbish the home of PC Kris Aves, who is wheelchair-bound and has no mobility from the chest down. Within nine days they made the vital changes that meant he could return home to his family after seven months in hospital. In an emotional interview before leaving hospital Kris, 35, said: “I’m worried about getting daddy time back. It’s just been taken away from you, and it’s not fair. “I need to rebuild a relationship with my family. It’s been too long.” Kris suffered spinal cord damage and head injuries in the attack last March and had to stay at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Bucks as his home was unsuitable for his rehabilitation. There was a large front step he could not negotiate and he could not fit through the narrow doorways. The kitchen was unsuitable and there was no bathroom on the ground floor.It meant he missed out on helping partner Marissa put their kids aged six and four to bed each night at their home in East Barnet, North London. But now he is home again thanks to the “biggest response ever” to a DIY SOS appeal with builders, joiners and electricians all working on refurbishment plans by designer Gabrielle Blackman. Host Nick Knowles tells viewers: “I’m not going to pretend we had to find an army, because the moment people knew what we were doing we had the biggest response ever.” Nick, 55, said the “amazing” volunteers “worked themselves into the ground to bring Kris home to his family where he belongs”. One volunteer says: “We want to give back to the people that protect us.” Terrorist Khalid Masood, 52, killed five people including PC Keith Palmer and injured over 50 before being shot dead outside Parliament last March. Kris was hurt as he crossed Westminster Bridge after receiving an award for his work. I have recently been medically retired from the police with PTSD following a serious injury on duty a few years ago. I would not be here if it was not for the PFOA - they literally saved my life. In February 2017 I was long-term sick off of work and I was in a very bad place. Whilst I have been unable to continue as a serving officer, I will forever be indebted to the PFOA. I will never be able to repay them for all that they did. All I can say is thank you so much from me and my family. PFOA assisted by offering counselling/coaching support to officer’s family. A respite break was granted to allow the officer and his family to get away and spend some valuable time together as a family unit. The PFOA purchased a new cross trainer and have loaned this to the officer to enable him to remain active and hopefully return to Ops. PFOA arranges support for the officers involved prior to the Inquest and after by way of a respite breaks and NLP Coaching or Counselling. I would like to personally thank the PFOA for the gifts we received for our daughter. The timing could not have been better. the week the gifts arrived, she had lost her hair and was due to go back to hospital for her next round of chemotherapy treatment which she was not looking forward to. Opening the parcel put a big smile back on her face for two reasons. firstly, because you had chosen as gifts exactly what she would have chosen for herself. But secondly and more importantly, because she realised other people ere also thinking of her and willing her to get better. People she had never met. Thank you so much for the shopping vouchers, they will come in very handy. Thank you for helping my daddy to be himself again. Keep helping police officers because some people don’t understand how hard it can be and they are doing a great thing.

{"originalUrl":"http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-westminster-attack-was-sick-and-depraved-10811016?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","text":"Theresa May has condemned the \"sick and depraved\" attack on London in which three people were killed by an attacker, who was shot dead by police. Speaking in Downing Street, the Prime Minister praised the \"exceptional bravery\" of police and security services during the attack in Westminster, and also paid tribute to the emergency services as a whole. She insisted any attempt to defeat the values Parliament stands for was \"doomed to failure\". And Mrs May vowed that \"the voices of hate and evil\" would never be allowed \"to drive us apart\" and she would \"never give in to terror\". The attacker, armed with two large knives, drove into a number of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, before crashing his car into railings and then running through Parliament gates and stabbing a police officer. The terrorist was killed after being shot by police. The officer also died of his wounds and the other two victims were pedestrians. Some 29 people were treated in hospital, some with \"catastrophic\" injuries. Mrs May said the location of the accident was \"no accident\" and \"terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital\". The Prime Minister said: \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all who have been affected, to the victims themselves and to their families and friends, who waved their loved ones off but will not now be welcoming them home. \"For those of us who were in Parliament at the time of this attack, these events provide a particular reminder of the exceptional bravery of our police and security services who risk their lives to keep us safe. \"Once again today, these exceptional men and women ran towards the danger, even as they encouraged others to move the other way.\" The PM also said Parliament would meet on Thursday \"as normal\", adding: \"Londoners - and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great City - will get up and go about their day as normal.\" 0:40 Video:How the Westminster attack unfolded She has chaired a meeting of the Government's emergency COBRA committee. The talks, lasting around 45 minutes, brought together senior ministers as well as senior police officers, representatives of the security agencies and London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Mrs May ordered flags to be lowered to half mast over Downing Street as a mark of respect to the innocent victims of the attack.","title":"Theresa May: Westminster attack was 'sick and

{"originalUrl":"http://www.frombehindenemylines.org.uk/2018/08/the-westminster-car-crash-deemed-a-terror-attack-britains-finest-have-their-dopiest-escapade-yet/","text":"Salih Khater (Salihk Hater) was the driver who ploughed a Ford Fiesta into a barrier outside of Parliament at just after half past seven of the hour, this past Tuesday gone. However, he wasn’t the only one making crazy manoeuvres on the streets of Westminster amongst all the skittled cyclists as they headed to work. The driver of the “mystery van” also cut across a reservation dividing two roads – and he wasn’t the only other “civilian” doing something naughty. In fact, there was so much going on in a matter of a minute or so of footage captured by the BBC (from the same equipment that captured the Westminster Bridge incident in 2017, no doubt), that altogether it started to scream “false flag attack”. Naturally, the fun and games have not been demonstrated to the public in all their glorious fullness; only the suspicious meanderings of the “mystery van” have achieved examination – and exoneration. Evidently, this vehicle made itself so conspicuous as to intrude upon whatever simple narrative was going to serve as an explanation for Khater’s stunt performance, and as such needed to be discussed by official parties out in the open in order to encourage the public to rationalise it as being perfectly normal. Reader, take note: a new record for the quickest time after an incident where the Establishment acts to counter a conspiracy theory. Indeed, the “mystery van” was such a sore thumb sticking out that it was raised by reporters at a press briefing by the head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Neil Basu (the latter-day Inspector Lestrade of Salisbury debacle fame) so that he could refer to it, and sweep it out of anyone’s further notice: “No, I’ve heard that this morning. There wasn’t a police car in pursuit of the vehicle.” This information comes from the Daily Mail, the only “big” corporate-media that gives room for the story on internet pages one doesn’t have to pay for (a reference to the Telegraph). The Mail’s treatment will be related in due course – it’s quite obvious by the time one reads to the end of it what the objective is. To appreciate the array of odd behaviour on display in the BBC footage of the so-called terror attack outside Parliament on the 14th August, one needs to understand the lay of the roads thereabouts. The A3212 runs parallel to the Thames with Parliament on its left, and the Square on its right. At the corner of Parliament Square, there is a choice to bend around to the right to travel perpendicularly with the river along the southern edge of the garden area, or to tend to the left and continue, eventually, to Millbank. It is off this south-heading section of the A3212 that there is a slip road leading to the St Stephens entrance of the Westminster Palace – for authorised vehicles, of course. Khater found himself in a barrier placed across the road to stop those who aren’t authorised. This south-to-north section of the A3212 merges into the western-travelling traffic after the right-hand bend (abovementioned), so essentially there are three pieces of road at the south-east corner of Parliament Square that are separated from each other by central reservations. The arrangement is plain to see on the map below: As far as the main incident goes – that is, the erratic journey of the silver Ford Fiesta that everyone is supposed to know about – it starts after Khater has already entered the bend. For pictorial assistance to understanding events, please refer to the “image array” – basically a post containing all the images, and more, mentioned in this text – at the FBEL page here. Moments later, an ambulance on a call (its lights flashing) that has weaved from the very left-hand side of the road into the very right-hand side, speeds past Khater, who turns, as if triggered to do it, sharply onto the reservation that separates the bend and the south-to-north section of the A3212. Luckily (by design, some might say) traffic lights have stopped oncoming vehicles so that Khater can drive the wrong way along a one-way road without coming to any harm, and over the reservation onto the A3212 going south. He then swerves onto the slip road – and the rest is history. By the way – some cyclists waiting on the reservations to cross got knocked over. So much for the main plot. In the background behind the Fiat is a silver van with its lights on (Fig. 1). This is the “mystery van”, and it probably starts to veer to the left from its starting position on the right hand side of the road when the ambulance gets in between it and the Fiesta (Fig.2). In doing this, the “mystery van” starts to cut up another vehicle – what we will call the “paddy wagon” for reasons about to be revealed. These two vehicles, and a third to their right, proceed to come to a halt – so presumably they are all stopped by traffic lights (Fig. 4). The “mystery van” is still waiting by the time the Fiesta has crossed the two central reservations in the junction complex at the south-east corner of Parliament Square (Fig. 5), but finally moves – technically jumping the lights – to cut in front of the “paddy wagon” just as the Fiesta is about to enter the slip road to the St Stephens entrance (Fig. 6). Moreover, the “mystery van” then itself cuts over central reservation to follow the Fiesta. Note – it does this before the Fiesta crashes, so it is not motivated by good will to a fellow driver whose crash might have appeared to have been an accident. Indeed, the person driving the “mystery van” is not a typical vehicle operator on the streets of London because he shows too much interest in a car that is about to commit a “terror attack”. Moreover, the driver of the “mystery van” gets stuck behind another vehicle, a white van (seen manoeuvring into position in Fig. 3), and cannot possibly see that the Fiesta has crashed, but is still in a tremendous hurry to keep up with it. This is demonstrated by the way it continuously showed its right-hand headlight along the side of the white van, which was travelling sedately, as if it was always looking for a way to pass even by mounting the kerb. In fact, the driver of the “mystery van” did put more than a wheel over the line to do this in the end so that it could stop in front of the white van near the scene of the crash (Fig. 7). Without a doubt, someone from the police or the security services has been caught tailing a “terror suspect” immediately prior to the attack he was about to commit. The Establishment has dealt with this officially and unofficially. Basu of the Met Police denied the police tail, as we have seen, but also made it be known that Mi5 had never heard of Khater. The distancing from the suspect is therefore complete in a way that rarely happens in such a case. Unofficially, at least one ex-policeman and Scotland Yard detective, David Videcette, has had his “expert” opinion telegraphed for public consumption. The following is from the Mail article linked to above: Experts, including retired Met detective David Videcette, who worked in counter-terrorism on 7/7, believes the Transit [“mystery van”] may have had a police officer behind the wheel. But it could [have] be[en] (sic) on a different job and noticed the strange behaviour of the driver. He said: ‘There appears to be silver Transit van following the Fiesta, the van has its lights on. The silver van carries on following the Fiesta wherever it goes. ‘The consensus between those of us who are ex-Police, is that this is likely an unmarked police vehicle, who spotted the Fiesta acting strangely before it rammed the barrier. …He added: ‘Perhaps the Fiesta was just on hostile reconnaissance, never intended on an attack today, but then realised he’d been spotted by someone, and hence carried out the attack in a small vehicle?’ The question that leaps out to the reader is how did Khater know that the police were operating an unmarked vehicle? He would only know if he was an insider on the operation. From the perspective of an Establishment voice whose experience of state crime includes involvement in the 7/7 bombings, there are no patsies who are insiders on the operation. Therefore, Videcette’s opinion cancels itself into nothing. His contribution is merely to encourage people not to think too much. The author’s opinion is this: the “mystery van” interjected when the driver saw the white van following the Fiesta – this is why it was in such a hurry to get past and in front of what was very likely a civilian vehicle getting itself into a position, by freak chance, that it shouldn’t have been in. Fig. 11 of the image array shows the white van turned back into the northward traffic, and the “mystery van” has effectively blocked the road. This would imply that the “mystery van” was part of a convoy to get the Fiesta to the right place at the right time – and that convoy could well have involved a marked police vehicle†. It is quite devastating stuff for whatever is left of the reputation of the state crime enablers formerly known as UK police forces.‡ The reader must understand that study of such events has taught the author a fact: there is not an arrangement that is ever too complex to rule it out from being employed by Government to perpetrate its state crime. And in this event, it is quite possible that the traffic lights on the junction complex coming from the south into Parliament Square were set to red at an appointed time, and then stayed red for an interminable time (and undeterminable time as far as we are concerned) for the purposes of the operation. Fig.12 of the image array shows a line of traffic coming from the south that has, at its head, the same vehicles that were waiting there when the incident started. For whatever other reason there was for closing down the flow of traffic at that point by traffic lights, this much we do know – it allowed speedy access for medical assistance to attend to all those unlucky cyclists. The reader might be astonished to learn that an ambulance arrived on the scene coming the wrong way up this road 39 seconds after the Fiesta crashed into that barrier (Fig. 10). The south-to-north road into the junction complex was also the scene of its own odd behaviour involving what we are calling the “three-point-turn” car, and its passenger, who disembarked moments after the Fiesta crashed (see Figs. 13-19). This man runs across all the roads to stand by yards away from the Fiesta, where he appears to signal with a raised hand. This is extraordinary, as there are also police present at the scene, amongst them, the ones famously leaping out of the way of the crashing vehicle (the same ones who may yet be decorated for bravery, by all accounts). And yet, this character is permitted to stand by the vehicle belonging to the suspect in a crime unmolested. Not only that, the “three-point-turn” car starts to manoeuvre, in the manner described by the appellation given to it, just as soon as its passenger starts crossing the roads. Eventually it is turned so that it can drive across the central reservation, and down into the crash scene. If the reader consults Fig. 11 of the image array, this car is very likely the one that is seen parked next to the “mystery van”. Again, the occupants of this vehicle have too much interest in the Fiesta, and act with too much authority for them to be well meaning passers-by. While this case is already possibly the dopiest false flag attack that ever took place in the history of the world, the floundering British Authorities are not through being incompetent yet. The police appear to be briefing the corporate-media, who is telling its audience that Khater is not playing ball. Apparently, he was in London to collect a Sudanese visa – that’s his story and he appears to be sticking to it (police have applied for more time for questioning). Does it indicate a patsy who figured it out a la James Earl Ray? Well, there’s a lot more can happen before we should start to speculate. Suffice it to say (and this is the author’s opinion) they might not even be able to get him on a count of attempted murder, let alone terrorism. † Here’s something very interesting. It appears that there is an attempt to explain the “paddy wagon” away as an ambulance. The Wikipedia entry for the incident says: An ambulance immediately behind the Ford stopped and gave assistance to the injured. [Basu] added the attacker was not been pursued by police before he struck the entrance to the Palace of Westminster and that the blue lights seen behind him in footage of the incident were those of an ambulance coincidentally answering a separate emergency call. Basu is talking about the ambulance that sped past the Fiesta. There was no ambulance immediately behind the Fiesta to give assistance. Below is an image of the “paddy wagon” (at the centre, in the front) and the weaving ambulance (on the right as the viewer looks at it) together at the top of the shot. The “paddy wagon” clearly does not have the same NHS yellow-green hue. The author is of the opinion that an effort to misrepresent the nature of the one vehicle behind the Fiesta that did actually stop is evidence that it was a police vehicle after all. ‡ Update 17/08/18: The following is from the Evening Standard, written, it says, by a man named Justin Davenport (because it is about time that names started to be noted in connection with journalism to aid and abet State Crime). What it constitutes is an attempt to explain the “mystery van” – now white in colour – as driven by a sort of have-a-go hero. The author’s criticism has been added in brackets, and by emphasis in bold. A mystery white van seen pursuing the alleged terrorist who drove into cyclists outside the Houses of Parliament was a member of the public trying to stop the attack, it emerged today. [Passing off unsubstantiated claims as fact and relying on an appeal to authority]. The unknown male driver of the Ford Transit van spotted suspect Salih Khater’s car veering into the security lane and immediately changed direction to give pursuit. [The male driver cannot be unknown if security services then retail a yarn about his adventures from his perspective. Rather, this civilian has been invented]. He raced after the suspect but became stuck behind another vehicle as Khater’s Ford Fiesta smashed into a security barrier. [This confirms that the Evening Standard is claiming that the “mystery van” was driven by a well-meaning civilian]. At first there was speculation that the mystery van was a police surveillance team who were secretly following Khater. [Basically the “copper on another job” fable didn’t cut the mustard]. However security sources confirmed that the driver was a member of the public who wanted to help. [The appeal to authority; it must be true because some unaccountable shadowy figures insist upon it]. A source said: “He stopped when he saw the car crash into the barriers. He wanted to help but when he saw the armed police arrive so quickly he realised there was little he could do.” [A source invented. In fact, the tale might just as well be a creation of the article’s writer, Davenport]. Of course, this information, which won’t name the driver despite his having made himself known to “security services”, apparently, to reveal his intentions, and which comes from an unnamed source from organisations that cannot be trusted, will appear highly unreliable – and a bit stupid – to the few of us who can think. However, the magic does work on the Muggles, and there are many, many more of them. It's important to donate to FBEL - please see here to find out whyA PayPal account not required.

According to the Mail on Sunday, a well-placed source said that Masood, 52, made the farewell call to a family member in the South East. Westminster terrorist Khalid MasoodCredit: METROPOLITAN POLICE In most interpretations of Islam, Masood's final words appear to follow the belief that Muslims enter paradise following death. He was shot dead by police in the grounds of Parliament. Scotland Yard have so far said it is possible that the motive behind \"lone wolf\" Masood's attack was an interest in Jihad. Formerly known as Adrian Elms, it is known that he was a Muslim convert and was living in Birmingham when he plotted the atrocity. Westminster attacker Adrian Ajao (aka Khalid Masood), at a fete in his hometown village of Northiam, SussexCredit: Julian Simmonds The paper reports that Masood told the family member: \"You will soon hear of my death, but don't worry, be happy, because I will be in a better place, I will be in paradise.\" He is said to have added: \"I want you to be happy for me, I don't want you to be sad.\" He then told the family member: \"I want it to be our secret.\" Police are understood to be aware of who Masood had the telephone conversation with, but decided they had no prior knowledge of the attack and has not been radicalised. Anti-terror police arrested a number of people who were all later released without charge, including members of Masood's family.

The service was conducted by the Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, who said in his Bidding: The landing of allied forces at Gallipoli on 25th April 1915 led to one of the bloodiest battles of the First World War. Australian and New Zealand forces joined together for the first time, and a new word entered the language: ANZAC. Remembering that so many died, we honour the bravery and determination of the men at Gallipoli. The memory of what became known as The Great War is with us as a warning and an encouragement. We are warned that war involves suffering and death; we are encouraged by the spirit of national pride shown by the soldiers we remember this ANZAC Day. At the start of the service the flags of New Zealand, Australia, Turkey and the United Kingdom were carried through the Abbey and placed beside the High Altar. The flags were borne by Warrant Officer II Daniel Bell (Australia), Warrant Officer Steve Clarke (New Zealand), Staff Sergeant Ozan Suslu (Turkey), and Major Tom Pauncefort (United Kingdom).

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said they were looking into the reports. More follows Witness Don Brind told the Press Association he heard shots being fired and saw two people apparently injured on the ground. Mr Brind, a researcher for MPs, said: \"I heard some shouting and saw some running out of the corner of my eye and then a short time after that there was a shot. I looked and I saw a civilian on the ground, with somebody standing over him with what I assumed to be a gun. \"Then I looked and about 10 yards away, there was a yellow jacketed person on the ground, who appeared to be alive and talking.\" He said he assumed the person in the high-visibility jacket was a police officer. Press Association reporter Laura Harding, who was in Westminster at the time of the incident, said: \"Everyone has been evacuated into Central Lobby, including a group of schoolchildren and kitchen staff. Dennis Burns, who was just entering Parliament for a meeting when the security alert happened, told the Press Association: \"As I was coming through the doors at Portcullis House, a policeman grabbed someone who was coming in and threw him out. \"As we were coming though the glass doors I was told by one security guard to get out while another one told me to get in. \"As I walked in I heard a security guard get a radio message saying 'a policeman has been stabbed'. \"Then I walked in as police officers and security start rushing out of the front doors on to the street. \"When I got inside I was wondering what the hell was going on and I saw dozens of panicked people running down the street. The first stream was around 30 people and the second stream was 70 people. The IndependentA police officer has been stabbed and at least one man has been shot in a \"serious\" incident outside the Houses of Parliament. At least two gun shots were heard by those inside Westminster. Proceedings in the House of Commons have been suspended. The deputy speaker of the Commons, David Lidington, announced the suspension, and said a police officer had been stabbed and the \"alleged assailant shot by armed police\".","title":"London attack as

{"originalUrl":"http://tribuneonlineng.com/london-attack-police-identify-westminster-attacker/","text":"London attack: Police identify Westminster attacker The man believed to have carried out the attack in Westminster has been named by police as Khalid Masood. Kent-born Masood, who died in the attack, was not the subject of any current police investigations, but had a range of previous convictions. According to the BBC, the 52-year-old was believed to have been living in the West Midlands. The so-called Islamic State group has said it was behind the attack, in which PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade and US tourist Kurt Cochran were killed. Eight arrests were made in London and Birmingham following Wednesday’s attack. Masood drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before crashing his car into railings and then running into the grounds of Parliament, armed with a knife. He stabbed PC Palmer and then was shot dead. Police said there had been no prior intelligence about his intention to carry out an attack. But he was known to the police and his previous convictions included GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He had not been convicted of any terrorism offences. Car hire company Enterprise said the vehicle used in the attack had been rented from its Spring Hill depot in Birmingham. The BBC understands Masood had hired the Hyundai SUV in person, giving his profession as a teacher. PC Palmer, who was stabbed in the grounds of Parliament, was a 48-year-old father. He was an unarmed member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection squad, with 15 years’ service. His family said in a statement that he would be remembered as a “wonderful dad and husband”.","title":"London attack: Police identify Westminster

Same exact date as the Brussels attacks. Coincidence? I think not. I was here then, too. The atmosphere became quite wary. “A knife-wielding assailant driving a sport utility vehicle mowed down panicked pedestrians and stabbed a police officer outside Parliament on Wednesday in a deadly assault, prompting the hasty evacuation of the prime minister and punctuating the threat of terrorism in Europe. At least four people, including the assailant, were killed and at least 40 others injured in the confusing swirl of violence, which the police said they assumed had been “inspired by international

{"originalUrl":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/westminster-mourns-victims-one-year-on-as-amber-rudd-targets-terror-recruiters-a3796446.html","text":"Amber Rudd today pledged a new drive against extremist recruiters as she marked the anniversary of last year’s Westminster attack by vowing that Britain will “not be defeated” by terrorism. The Home Secretary said action would be taken against both Islamist and far-Right radicalisers seeking to spread hatred and violence. One aim will be to counter attempts by Islamic State to “foster a grievance narrative” by making Muslims in Britain feel under attack. There will also be renewed efforts to stop “racists” exploiting Islamist murders to justify retaliatory “acts of cruelty and hatred”. Victims’ families and friends, politicians and police were among those who marked the anniversary by commemorating people killed or injured at Westminster and the terror atrocities which followed. Andreea Cristea was among the victims of the Westminster attack Five people died when Khalid Masood drove into pedestrians crossing Westminster Bridge then ran through the gates of Parliament to fatally stab Pc Keith Palmer. Westminster attack: One year on In the following months, 22 people were killed in the Manchester arena suicide bombing, eight died in the London Bridge attack, and a man was killed when Darren Osborne rammed a van into a crowd at Finsbury Park mosque. There was also a botched attempt to bomb a Tube train at Parsons Green, which injured 30 people. Today Theresa May, Ms Rudd and the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, attended a service at St Mary Undercroft chapel in Parliament. The Bishop praised the capital’s “resilience and hope” and said her “heart goes out to those who lost loved ones”. The Prime Minister laid a wreath of white lilies and roses at Parliament Square, accompanied by a signed note reading: “In memory of those who were lost and in defiance of those who would seek to silence our democracy.” Ms Rudd expressed sympathy for victims and praised those who sought to help them. In an article for the Standard she warned that further action was needed to stop radicalisers from inspiring more attacks. “Islamists and far-Right terrorists share one thing in common – they are united through their adherence to hate,” she said.

The Bishop of London said she had met people from “across the capital’s communities” and been “struck by what brings them together and their reslience and hope”. We should be proud of how we stood united but we cannot be complacent Amber Rudd Today I will be remembering and honouring those affected in the Westminster attack with my colleagues in the very place that the terrorists tried to destroy — our Parliament. I will be remembering the bravery of our emergency services, including Pc Keith Palmer who made the ultimate sacrifice. And I will be thinking of those left behind whose lives have been forever changed. When our values come under attack that is the time when we must commit more than ever to that which unites us. We are proud to live in a decent, open and respectful society. Terrorists want to attack our way of life and cause maximum disruption in society. They thrive over the divisions their actions cause and hope that we respond with panic. Islamists and far-Right terrorists have one thing in common — they are united through their adherence to hate. Daesh want nothing more than for all British Muslims to feel under attack in this country too. This only helps to feed a grievance narrative that is deployed by predatory recruiters. That is why it is important to tackle all forms of terrorism, whether Islamist or far-Right. We need to respond by stamping out those recruiters, whether it is an Islamist terrorist disseminating material that inspires and instructs how to carry out an attack, or a racist who uses Westminster to provide justification for further acts of cruelty and hatred. We cannot only deal with those who have been already been drawn into terrorist activity. We need to intervene earlier and stop people being radicalised in the first place. We cannot be complacent. Westminster was the first of five attacks in this country last year, including three more in our capital at London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green. But we must recognise the professionalism of those who are protecting us and the 10 Islamist terrorist plots and four far-Right terrorist plots that have been thwarted since March last year. As I make my way to Westminster today I will see Londoners and tourists enjoying the sights and freedom this great city has to offer. And I will remember how we all came together to stand united against the terrorists. This is something to be proud of. We will not be defeated. It proved Londoners had “more in common than divides us”, she added. “Any anniversary of such a terrible event will inevitably bring back difficult memories. My heart goes out to those who lost loved ones and those who were injured. We share in their suffering as we remember them. “After the attack, I was in touch with staff from St Thomas’ Hospital. It was from there that staff rushed to help the casualties, and our ongoing gratitude goes out to the response of all of London’s emergency and health services.” In Parliament, MPs held a minute’s silence. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said: “We unite together, in their memory, to face down these despicable and cowardly acts.” Floral tributes were left outside Parliament and on the bridge. Stopping to look at them, Kay, an intensive care nurse at St Thomas’ who had worked the night shift after the attack, said: “That day when we were coming into work we didn’t know what it was going to be like, but there was a great feeling on the unit of everybody coming together and keeping London safe.” One bouquet contained a message to victims: “You, your families and your friends are in our thoughts.” Another ended: “May God bless you always.”","title":"Westminster mourns victims one year on... as Amber Rudd targets terror recruiters | London Evening

The suspect, who is being held at a south London police station on suspicion of carrying out terrorist offences, was identified as a 29-year-old British citizen by police. While he has not been formally identified, government sources cited by the BBC named him as Salih Khater. According to a Facebook page that bears the same name, Khater described himself as a \"shop manager\" and studied at Sudan University of Science and Technology. Security minister Ben Wallace confirmed that the suspect \"came from another country originally,\" but gave no further details. Roger Godsiff, Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green, confirmed that he is understood to have been a resident in the city, where two addresses were searched on Tuesday. \"Today's attack at Westminster was carried out by an individual who is believed to have been living in my constituency in Birmingham. My deepest sympathies to the cyclists and pedestrians who were injured in the attack,\" Godsiff tweeted. A man and a woman have been discharged from hospital after sustaining \"non-life-threatening injuries\", police said. Another man was treated at the scene. The silver Ford Fiesta involved in the incident, which took place at 7:37am on Tuesday as commuters made their way to work, had travelled from Birmingham to London the night before, arriving just after midnight, according to the Metropolitan Police. The car stayed around Tottenham Court Road, in central London, from about 1:25am until 5:55am, before the driver headed to Westminster. One of the two properties searched in Birmingham was in Sparkhill, in the southeast of the city, according to local reporters. I'm outside this flat in #Sparkhill where police have finished searching the property believed to be the home of the 29 year-old man arrested on suspicion on terror offences in #Westminster https://t.co/z2FLtsUyg6 An address in Nottingham, about 50 miles northeast of Birmingham, was also searched on Tuesday. No other arrests have been made.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=169156","text":"The sacrifice of “six million Jews” was being talked about before Hitler rose to power. A photocopy from the American Hebrew dated Oct. 1919, speaks openly about a holocaust of six million Jews before declaring “Israel is entitled to a place in the sun”!! Long before it became a crime in some countries to question the Holocaust, in fact before it is even supposed to have happened, Zionists were invoking the figure of “Six Million” and talking of a sacrifice for Israel With Afghanistan and Iraq already lost, the Wall Street bankers were all desperately looking for other ways to control our world, when suddenly and very conveniently, the Sumatran Trench exploded. Trick or Treat? Joe Vialls investigates The Talmud expounds some of the most virulent racism, as these extracts plainly show. However, as a reader points out not all Jews are influenced by it, or even read it. Only the ultra religious study it, the rest haven’t a clue. We leave you to decide Tyler Durden — Zero Hedge April 22, 2018 A senior correspondent for German state media broadcast ZDF heute stunned his European audience during a report from on the ground in Syria when he gave a straightforward and honest account of his findings while investigating what happened in Douma. The veteran reporter, Uli Gack, interviewed multiple eyewitnesses of the April 7 alleged chemical attack and concluded of the testimonials, “the Douma chemical attack is most likely staged, a great many people here seem very convinced.” It appears that all local Syrians encountered by the German public broadcast reporter were immediately dismissive of the widespread allegation that the Syrian government gassed civilians, which the US, UK, France, and Israel used a pretext for launching missile strikes on Damascus. ZDF heute: The world continues to puzzle over whether the banned chemical weapons were used in Douma. ZDF correspondent Uli Gack is in Syria for us: “you were in a large refugee camp today and talked to a lot of people – what did you hear about the attack there?” Gack responded, “the Douma chemical attack is most likely staged, a great many people here seem very convinced.” The German ZDF report is consistent with veteran British journalist Robert Fisk’s investigation upon being the first Western journalist to gain access to the site in Douma. Fisk reported early this week, “There are the many people I talked to amid the ruins of the town who said they had ‘never believed in’ gas stories–which were usually put about, they claimed, by the armed Islamist groups.” ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen) is one of Germany’s largest and oldest state-owned channels, which is funded in part through citizens paying a household licensing fee, and Heute is perhaps the most visible public news program in all of Germany. According to the live report, some witnesses told ZDFthat Islamist rebels killed victims with chlorine, filmed the scenes, then claimed an ‘Assad chemical attack’. Though interviewing “a great many people [who] seem convinced” that a chemical attack did not actually happen, the reporter did not attempt to censor what he consistently heard from locals who were said to be in the area when the events occurred. Increasingly, it appears that mainstream media gate-keepers are losing it over the fact that so many highly visible and respected reporters and broadcasters have featured reports this week which publicly question the Syrian chemical attack narrative and US coalition missile strikes that followed. One writer for the Guardian and Daily Beast who is a well-known pro regime-change advocate, for example, laments that “disinformation has taken hold” on Syria. In a series of tweets following Robert Fisk’s bombshell report for theIndependent, Emma Beals, who often simply parrots whatever her ‘rebel’ sources tell her reacted to the recent profusion of high profile pundits questioning the established narrative on major British platforms. My educated and informed friends are emailing me en masse asking me about what’s going on in Syria because “it’s so hard to work out the truth.” Having spent years busting a gut to dig it out, it’s heartbreaking to see the extent to which disinformation has taken hold. My educated and informed friends are emailing me en masse asking me about what's going on in Syria because \"it's so hard to work out the truth.\" Having spent years busting a gut to dig it out, it's heartbreaking to see the extent to which disinformation has taken hold. Once upon a time, a country called Syria was ruled by a ruthless dictator named Bashar Al-Assad. He was a cruel man who gassed his own people. His actions caused a civil war in Syria. America and Europe tried their best to stop the devastating civil war, and even generously accepted many Syrian refugees. Eventually America went to Syria, defeated ISIS, and is now trying to restore stability. This above version is quite popular among many Americans and Europeans and the Western mainstream media. Meanwhile, almost simultaneous to German TV’s ZDF heute report from Syria, lawyers of the Bundestag (German federal parliament) issued a legal brief on the US-led strike on Syria. The government lawyers’ report was requested by the left-wing party Die Linke in response to the US coalition missile strikes which primarily targeted facilities in and around Damascus. “The deployment of military force against a state to punish it for breaking an international convention is a violation of the international law prohibiting violence,” reads the report, as cited by the German Press agency DPA and translated by Sputnik. The legal report further concluded that the US-led attack on Syria – which skirted the UN – but which was supported by the German government (though without German military participation) was based in chemical attack claims that the legal team deemed “not convincing”.","title":"Germany’s Largest Public TV News Broadcaster: Syria Chemical Attack “Most Likely

{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/uk/382703-westminster-terrorist-attack-vigil/","text":"‘Hand in hand’: Vigil held on Westminster Bridge for terrorist attack victims (VIDEO) People across all “nations, faiths, orientation and sexes” stood hand in hand on Westminster Bridge to commemorate the victims of the terrorist attack that took place on March 22. A human chain was formed on both the west and east sides of the bridge as part of a vigil in solidarity for the four victims killed in last Wednesday’s assault on Parliament. Khalid Masood, 52, killed four people and injured 50 more after driving into people on Westminster Bridge’s pavements and crashing into Parliament’s railings before getting out of the car and stabbing a police officer to death. The attacker was later shot dead. The Metropolitan Police Federation said the human chain aimed to show that “we will not be divided. Linking all nations, faiths, orientation and sexes.” Met officers joined hands with members of the public to form a line-up of ‘Hands across Westminster Bridge’ at 2:15pm. At 2:30, up to 500 faith leaders from across the UK, including members from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, walked down the middle of the bridge, between the human chains. A minute of silence was then held at 2:40pm. Westminster Bridge and surrounding roads will be closed from 12:30pm until 3:30pm. A separate human chain was organized by Women’s March On London on Sunday, an event which saw dozens of women stand together in solidarity with those affected by the attack. The vigil came as an inquest into the victims’ death was opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner’s Court on Wednesday. Victims of the attack include PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father of a five-year-old girl, and US tourist American Kurt Cochran, 54, who was in London with his wife to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. In a statement from Aysha’s family they described her as a, “caring daughter, loving sister, amazing wife, irreplaceable aunt, thoughtful, supportive friend and the best and coolest of mummies.” \"You were ripped away from our lives in the cruellest and most cowardly of ways. We now pray that you guide and protect not only us, but all of London, from further evil. You will always be remembered as our guardian angel who never shied away from facing up to bullies.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/uk/381771-gunfire-loud-bangs-parliament/#.WNN7NFe3hsE.twitter","text":"“We think we know who the attacker is,” Acting Deputy Commissioner & national lead for Counter Terrorism Policing Mark Rowley said but stated that they were not willing to divulge the assailant’s name at this time, though they did admit that it “Islamic terrorism is our assumption.” A/Dep Cmsr Rowley: \"At this stage - but it may change - we believe approx 40 people were injured including three police officers.\" London Ambulance Service says it has treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge. An eyewitness has told Sky News he saw a body \"face down\" in the Thames. Witnesses said people either jumped or were knocked over the side of the bridge as the car mounted the pavement and struck a number of pedestrians. A spokesman for the Port of London Authority, which looks after safety on the river, said a female member of the public had been recovered from the water near Westminster bridge after she \"fell\" or \"jumped\" in. \"A female member of the public was recovered alive from the water, but with serious injuries. She has been brought ashore and is undergoing urgent medical treatment. The working assumption is that she fell or jumped from the bridge.\" “I came out of Westminster Tube at about 2:45pm when police were locking down the tube, ushering people out away from Parliament. I was ushered onto Westminster Bridge, and then I looked across the bridge, onto the west pavement,” he recalled. “For the whole length of the bridge, from south to north, there were people lying on the ground and I was then told that a car had driven from the south end all the way up the pavement to the north end of the bridge. I counted at least eight people clearly injured on the ground.” Incident in #Westminster: We are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise Another witness described seeing a middle-aged man carrying a knife running towards the Palace of Westminster. Kamal Alam, a Syrian military analyst whose office isn’t far from where the attack took place, also spoke with RT. “I thought it’s just some kind of school drill, but within a few seconds heard what sounded like gunshots and a lot of screaming, and all of a sudden there [were] dozens of armed policemen telling everyone to run away from Parliament Square and Westminster Tube Station,” he said. Jayne Wilkinson told Sky News: \"We were taking photos of Big Ben and we saw all the people running towards us, and then there was an Asian guy in about his 40s carrying a knife about seven or eight inches long. \"And then there were three shots fired, and then we crossed the road and looked over. The man was on the floor with blood. \"He had a lightweight jacket on, dark trousers and a shirt. \"He was running through those gates, towards parliament, and the police were chasing him.\" Impossible to be sure from here, but judging by the lack of resuscitation efforts it doesn't look good for either police officer or attacker According to Doug Weeks, terrorism expert at London Metropolitan University, the attack, while softened by the high security presence in the area, could have been far bloodier. “Well certainly within the Parliament compound itself, that is by far one of the most secure areas within London. There are numerous police officers and other security personnel that work in that area as well as around that area, thus it’s not surprising that the police have a very rapid response to this incident,” Weeks told RT. Following the attack, Number 10 said Prime Minister Theresa May was safe. The spokesman declined to say where May was when the attack took place. It is understood, however, she was rushed to a car 40 yards from the gates outside parliament where the shots were fired minutes after the attack. She was ushered by at least eight armed undercover police, some with their firearms drawn. The leader of the House of Commons David Lidington said the alleged assailant was shot by armed police \"inside the parliament perimeter.\" Terror attack outside U.K. Parliament. 2 men down on road.

An air ambulance landed in Parliament Square shortly after the incident. London Ambulance Service deputy director of operations Pauline Cranmer said it has \"declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible.\" The US State Department said it was closely following the \"concerning situation\" in the UK. \"The Department of Homeland Security stands in solidarity alongside our friends in the United Kingdom in condemning the terrible attack at Parliament today.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.euronews.com/2017/03/22/eyewitness-accounts-of-westminster-attack","text":"Eyewitness accounts of Westminster attack An attack nearby the Palace of Westminster in London occured on the afternoon of Wednesday, March 22. A car mounted the sidewalk and plowed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge leading to multiple serious injuries with one death arleady confirmed. A knife-wielding attacker was killed after stabbing a policeman. Here are some eyewitness accounts. Quentin Letts, a parliamentary sketchwriter for the Daily Mail said: “I was in my office overlooking New Palace Yard. This is the area where the shooting happened and I saw the shooting happen and I saw some of the stabbing or what seems to have been stabbing going on and then I saw I’m afraid what looks like fruitless attempts to save a man who’d fallen, who I think was one of the policemen. He was wearing black clothes, he didn’t have much hair, he was quite think set. And he set about one of the policeman with what looked like a stick. The policeman fell over on the ground and it was pretty horrible to watch. Then having done that, he disengaged and ran towards the House of Commons entrance used by MPs and he got about 20 yards or so when two plainclothes guys with guns shot him. And I have to say that they were very quick to run out of wherever they ran out of and ran towards him and they did the shooting pose with their legs straight and one leg in front of the other. And they shouted something at him and he appeared to ignore it and kept running towards them and then two or three shots and he fell instantly.” He ran in through the open gates. These are the gates where people drive in and out of the Parliamentary Estate and they are manned by uniformed policeman. The gates were open and this man ran through. John Campbell, who witnessed events from a passing bus told the Telegraph: I was upstairs on the number 88 bus which was stuck in a traffic jam on parliament square when I saw a lot of people running up from Westminster Bridge. I then saw a man running with a very large kitchen knife. He was running really fast and went straight past the guards at the gate. I then saw him stab a police officer two or three times. His colleague then intervened and the officer managed to stagger away. I then heard two neat shots and the man went down. Richard Tyse told Sky News: “I came out of Westminster tube station which was being locked down behind me (by police). I was ushered onto Westminster Bridge and looked onto the west pavement of the bridge and literally north to south I must have counted 8-10 prostrate figures on the ground. I understand a car had driven along the pavement knocking people over and that’s why many people were lying on the ground. The whole length of the bridge there were people on the ground who had clearly been injured Alan Parry from Sky Sports News said: “I was just outside Westminster tube station when I heard an almighty crash and a vehicle that looked like a 4×4 had crashed into the railings (at parliament). There was smoke coming from underneath the bonnet. I saw a pedestrian or a cyclist who had clearly been hit. The driver of the car sprinted away from the scene. That was followed by four what sounded very much like gunshots. Then all of a sudden all hell was let loose and police descended everywhere. The whole area was locked down. It was a frightening couple of minutes.” Kevin Schofield, editor of Politics Home was in parliament at the time of the attack. Writing on Twitter: Then there were gunshots and lots of armed police running around everywhere.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.savemysweden.com/britain-heading-towards-disaster/","text":"Britain: heading towards disaster Reports of alleged links between Islamic charities and terrorism or extremism surged to a record high, according to the Charity Commission, a charity watchdog. By – Soeren Kern Azad Ali, an Islamist who has said that he supports killing British soldiers, was named a director of Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend), a controversial Muslim pressure group which advises the British government. Ali said that the jihadist attack at Westminster on March 22, 2017 was not an act of terrorism. “Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections.” — Manchester-born singer Morrissey. The British government refused to say whether telling people about Christianity could be a hate crime. Lord Pearson of Rannoch said that when he raised a question on the issue in the House of Lords, the government failed to state clearly whether Christians can be prosecuted just for stating their beliefs. The Muslim population of Britain surpassed 4.1 million in 2017 to become around 6.3% of the overall population of 64 million, according to a recent study on the growth of the Muslim population in Europe. In real terms, Britain has the third-largest Muslim population in the European Union, after France, then Germany. The rapid growth of Britain’s Muslim population can be attributed to immigration, high birth rates and conversions to Islam. Islam and Islam-related issues, omnipresent in Britain during 2017, can be categorized into several broad themes: 1) Islamic extremism and the security implications of British jihadists; 2) The continuing spread of Islamic Sharia law in Britain; 3) The sexual exploitation of British children by Muslim gangs; 4) Muslim integration into British society; and 5) The failures of British multiculturalism. JANUARY 2017 January 1. Hundreds of adult asylum seekers lied about their age in order to enter Britain “as teenagers,” according to official data provided under the Freedom of Information Act. Figures obtained by Mail on Sunday show that social workers carried out 2,028 age tests between 2013-2016, during which almost one in four of the claimants — 465 — were found to be over 18. By concealing their real age, migrants hope to improve their chances of being granted asylum. January 1. Reports of alleged links between Islamic charities and terrorism or extremism surged to a record high, according to the Charity Commission, a charity watchdog. The number of times the Commission shared concerns about links between charities and extremism with police and other agencies nearly tripled, from 234 to 630 in just three years. January 4. Jamshid Piruz, a 34-year-old Afghan-born Dutch citizen declared guilty of murder in the Netherlands, pled guilty to attacking two British police officers with a hammer. Piruz entered the UK unchallenged, despite being convicted of decapitating a Chinese woman in Amsterdam. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison for the murder, but released early. As a Dutch resident, Piruz was allowed to travel freely across the EU. “Britain has got to have tougher border controls,” said MP Henry Smith. January 6. St. Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral in Glasgow featured a reading from the Koran which denied the divinity of Jesus Christ. The Koran reading, aimed at “reaching out to Muslims,” was held on Epiphany, a festival which celebrates the incarnation of God in the person of Jesus Christ. One of the Queen’s chaplains, Gavin Ashenden, referred to the Koran reading as “blasphemy” and said the decision showcased the limits of interfaith dialogue. He resigned on January 23 in order to “speak more freely” about the struggle of Christianity in British culture. January 7. Tanveer Ahmed, a 32-year-old jihadist serving a 27-year prison sentence for the murder in Glasgow of Asad Shah, an Ahmadi Muslim shopkeeper, issued a recording from Scotland’s Barlinnie prison in which he called for the “elimination” of the enemies of Islam. January 8. MI5 launched a manhunt for a Syrian scientist posing as a refugee and plotting a chemical attack on a British seaside town. January 9. Inspectors from Ofsted, the schools regulator, concluded that Darul Hadis Latifiah, an all-boys school in East London, was not preparing pupils “for life in modern Britain.” Many of the students at the school could not name the British prime minister. Inspectors also found books which “promoted inappropriate views” on how females should behave, and found a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera in the bathroom. January 15. Twelve of Britain’s most dangerous Islamic terrorists were to be placed in containment units in three prisons at a cost of about £1 million ($1.34 million) a year, according to The Sunday Times. The aim is to prevent them from radicalizing other inmates. January 17. Cambridge Professor Wendy Ayres-Bennett called on Britons to learn languages such as Polish, Punjabi and Urdu to make immigrant families feel more at home. She said that English speakers should think of immigration as a “two-way street” and be able to communicate in another language to aid integration and social cohesion. January 18. Manchester United appointed a counter-terrorism manager to protect against jihadist attacks. It was believed to be the first Premier League football club to do so. January 20. Gloucester Cathedral invited Imam Hassan of the local Masjid-e-Noor mosque to perform the traditional Muslim invocation to worship at the launch of a multicultural Faith Exhibition. A video of the call to prayer was posted on the cathedral’s Facebook page. One commenter wrote: “My ancestors built this cathedral and to allow a practicing Muslim to pray to another god is insanely naive. What did you think it would do? Encourage them to convert?” January 22. Hani al-Sibai, a 55-year-old Islamic extremist, was granted £123,000 ($165,000) in public money to help him fight deportation, even though he is alleged to be a “key influencer” of the Ansar al-Sharia movement, a terror group which murdered 30 British tourists at a Tunisian beach resort. Al-Sibai, whose three-story housing association home in West London is worth £1 million, is also said to have radicalized Mohammed Emwazi, the Islamic State executioner known as “Jihadi John.” January 24. St. Clare’s School, a Roman Catholic School in Handsworth, found itself at the center of a social media storm after telling the parents of a four-year-old Muslim girl that she could not wear the hijab, a traditional Islamic headscarf, in class. The school has a strict uniform policy and asked the girl’s parents to respect it. The girl’s father refused and asked Birmingham City Council’s Labour cabinet member Waseem Zaffar to intervene. Zaffar said: “I’m insisting this matter is addressed asap with a change of policy.” January 25. Abandi Kassim, a 44-year-old taxi driver in Leicester, was fined for breaching equality laws when he refused to carry a guide dog because he claimed it was against his religion. Kassim turned away Charles Bloch, 22, who is legally blind, and his dog in Leicester in July 2016. He pled guilty to refusing to convey a guide dog, an offense under the Equality Act 2010, and was fined £340 ($450) plus £200 costs and a £50 victim surcharge. January 26. The City of Edinburgh invited citizens to vote for projects designed to create a city “free from Islamophobia.” Some £40,000 ($54,000) were made available for projects “to help local people deliver innovative projects which reduce prejudice and foster positive relationships between diverse communities.” January 28. Changing of the Guard ceremonies at Windsor Castle were cancelled amid fears of jihadist attacks. Police said jihadis could target soldiers and the thousands of tourists who gather to watch the time-honored military tradition. FEBRUARY 2017 February 1. Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons that women should feel free to wear the hijab, a traditional Islamic headscarf. Several European countries have imposed bans on parts of Muslim religious dress. “What a woman wears is a woman’s choice,” May said. On February 1 (“world hijab day”), UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that women should feel free to wear the hijab, a traditional Islamic headscarf, stating: “What a woman wears is a woman’s choice.” Pictured above: Theresa May (then Home Secretary) wears a headscarf while attending an interfaith event at Al Madina Mosque in East London, in February 2015. (Image source: Imams Online video screenshot) February 2. Six Muslim men shouted “Allahu Akbar” as they were sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court for a total of 81 years for sexually abusing two girls — including one who became pregnant at age 12 — in Rotherham. February 5. Muslim pupils outnumber Christian children in more than 30 church schools, including one Church of England primary school that has a “100% Muslim population,” according to The Sunday Times. St. Thomas in Werneth, Oldham, is reported to have no Christian pupils, while at Staincliffe Church of England Junior School in Batley, West Yorkshire, 98% of pupils “come from a Muslim background.” The Church of England estimated that about 20 of its schools had more Muslim pupils than Christians and 15 Roman Catholic schools had majority Muslim pupils. February 7. Zakaria Bulhan, a 19-year-old Norwegian national of Somali origin, was sentenced to indefinite confinement at Broadmoor Hospital after he admitted to killing American tourist Darlene Horton and wounding five others in a rampage in central London on August 3, 2016. Bulhan, from Tooting, South London, pled guilty at the Old Bailey to “manslaughter by diminished responsibility” on the grounds that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attacks. He had been charged with murder and attempted murder, but the court accepted his plea. During his arrest, Bulhan repeatedly muttered “Allah, Allah, Allah,” and police found a Muslim prayer book, “Fortress of the Muslim,” in his pants pocket. The court, however, decided that Islam was not a factor in Bulhan’s behavior. February 7. A Chatham House survey of more than 10,000 people from ten European countries found that an average of 55% agreed that all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped. Majorities in all but two of the ten states agreed, ranging from 71% in Poland, 65% in Austria, 53% in Germany and 51% in Italy to 47% in the United Kingdom and 41% in Spain. February 9. A 44-year-old man from Hertfordshire was arrested at Gatwick Airport on terrorism charges after he disembarked from a flight from Iraq. He was charged under Section 5 of the 2006 Terrorism Act: suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. February 12. A National Health Service (NHS) project based on research by Leeds University claimed that Muslims with mental health issues could be helped by re-embracing Islam. Lead researcher Ghazala Mir helped to create a new treatment: Patients are asked if faith was part of their life when they were well. Those who stopped being religious are re-introduced to Islam by means of a self-help booklet. February 14. Clayton McKenna, a 22-year-old Briton who converted to Islam while in prison, appeared at Newcastle Crown Court after he carried an axe through the streets of Boldon Colliery. Apparently, he had planned to confront his Christian father over “religious differences.” McKenna allegedly told police that he was on his way to his father’s home “to ask him to bow down to me.” Judge Penny Moreland told McKenna: “I am concerned that there is no real explanation for your confused thinking that morning, nor for those threats made.” February 15. Faisal Bashir, a 43-year-old father of two from Ilford, was forced to move out of his home after he renounced Islam and stopped attending a mosque. Bashir said he was subject to harassment, but police dismissed his pleas for help as “just a nuisance.” The Chairman of the Ilford-based British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA), Wilson Chowdhry, said: “Police and councils up and down the country just don’t understand the level of animosity people choosing to leave Islam can face.” February 16. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe urgedMuslim scholars to step up efforts to counter the Islamic State. He said he believed that IS fighters were “political criminals” who were carrying out “horrific violence” which had no justification in Islam. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Hogan-Howe repeated the politically correct dogma that the Islamic State is not Islamic. February 18. Britain’s first-ever “modest” fashion event was held in London with more than 40 designers displaying garments that comply with Muslim values. Event organizer Romanna Bint-Abubaker, founder of modest fashion website Haute Elan, told Sky News: “The fastest growing global consumer is at the moment the Muslim market. By 2030, one in three people will be a Muslim in the world — that is a huge population.” February 19. Counter-terrorism police launched an investigation into claims that Trish O’Donnell, head of Clarksfield Primary School in Oldham, was being forced to work from home after death threats from Muslim parents opposed to her Western values. O’Donnell reportedly was subject to “harassment and intimidation” in the form of “aggressive verbal abuse” and “threats to blow up her car” from parents pushing conservative Muslim ideals. The school is mostly filled with Pakistani pupils who do not speak English as a first language. February 20. Members of Parliament debated U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s state visit to Britain. Left-wing MPs called for the invitation to be withdrawn to protest Trump’s travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries. Conservative Party MPs accused their opponents of hypocrisy and insulting the American people. February 21. Rezzas Abdulla, a 33-year-old man from South Shields, was sentenced to eight months in prison. The sentence was then suspended so that he could receive treatment for mental health problems, for assaulting a woman and her nine-month old baby. Rebecca Telford, 25, and her daughter were strolling in South Shields in January 2016 when Abdulla leaned into the baby carriage and spat into the baby’s mouth, and allegedly said, “white people shouldn’t breed,” before launching into a tirade of racial abuse. February 22. Jamal al-Harith, a 50-year-old British convert to Islam, blew himself up at an Iraqi army base in Mosul. He had received £1 million (€1.1 million; $1.2 million) in compensation from the British government after being freed from Guantánamo Bay in 2004. Al-Harith, originally named Ronald Fiddler, was born in Manchester to parents of Jamaican origin and took the name Jamal al-Harith when he converted to Islam. He was also known more recently as Abu-Zakariya al-Britani. Captured in Afghanistan in early 2002, and released from Guantánamo Bay after two years, he later joined IS. February 23. The BBC paid “very substantial” libel damages and broadcast a full apology to Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, founder member of the Muslim Council of Britain, who was falsely accused of calling for the lynching of author Salman Rushdie. February 26. Shahriar Ashrafkhorasani, a 33-year-old Iranian-born convert from Islam set to be ordained as a Church of England priest, accused Oxford University of discrimination and bias after he was told he could not ask a professor questions about Islam. Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, a former senior fellow at Wycliffe Hall, said that a “politically correct” atmosphere is “very widespread in the university as a whole.” He added: “If people are taking money from these [Muslim] sources, then that can limit the critical approach to the study of Islam and Muslim civilization generally.” February 27. A spokesman for the West Midlands Police wrote on social media that parents caught practicing female genital mutilation (FMG) on their children should not be prosecuted. He revealed that the force is opposed to “prosecuting/jailing” parents for FGM because it would be “unlikely to benefit” children who fall victim to the crime. February 28. Patrick Kabele, a 32-year-old convert to Islam, was found guilty of preparing terrorist acts — namely attempting to travel to Syria — contrary to the 2006 Terrorism Act. During his trial, jurors at Woolwich Crown Court heard how Kabele, from Willesden in North London, tried to join the Islamic State in Syria, where he wanted to buy a “nine-year-old virgin, the younger the better.” He added that if he had enough money, he would buy four wives. Kabele, who was born in Uganda and became a British citizen, told police after his arrest that he did not “owe an oath of allegiance” to the United Kingdom. MARCH 2017 March 1. A Channel 4 documentary series called “Extremely British Muslims” showed the inner workings of a sharia court inside Birmingham’s Central Mosque. In the first episode, viewers witnessed the case of mother-of-four Fatima, 33, as she sought permission to divorce her drug dealer husband whom she says has abused her throughout their 14-year marriage. According to sharia law, Muslim women must plead their divorce cases in court, while Muslim men need only to say the words “I divorce you” three times to obtain a divorce. Birmingham Central Mosque said it allowed the sharia proceedings to be filmed in an effort to “break down misconceptions about Islam.” Some 100 sharia courts in Britain are now dispensing Islamic justice outside the remit of the British legal system. March 2. English actor Riz Ahmed warned that the lack of Muslim faces on British television was alienating young people, driving them towards extremism and into the arms of the Islamic State. Delivering Channel 4’s annual diversity lecture in Parliament, Ahmed said that television had a pivotal role to play in ensuring that Muslims felt heard, and valued, in British society. March 3. The Amateur Swimming Association changed its swimsuit regulations to allow Muslim women to wear full body outfits, after a request from the Muslim Women’s Sport Foundation. The rule was changed to encourage more Muslim women to take part in the sport. March 4. Ryan Counsell, a 28-yeara-old jihadist from Nottingham who left his wife and two small children to fight with the Abu Sayyaf Islamist group in the Philippines, blamed his behavior on the Brexit vote. He told the Woolwich Crown Court that increased tension within the local Muslim community after Brexit sparked his decision to leave. He said that he wanted to escape Britain’s political climate and seek an “idyllic life” under sharia law. March 5. Homegrown terrorism inspired by the Islamic State poses the dominant threat to the national security of the United Kingdom, according to a comprehensive new report on violent Islamism in Britain. The 1,000-page report — “Islamist Terrorism: Analysis of Offenses and Attacks in the UK (1998–2015)” — was published by the Henry Jackson Society, a foreign policy think tank based in London. March 6. British security services prevented 13 potential terror attacks since June 2013, according to Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK’s most senior counter-terrorism police officer. He also said that there were 500 live counter-terror investigations at any given time, and that investigators have been arresting terror suspects at a rate of close to one a day since 2014. The official threat level for international terrorism in the UK has stood at severe — meaning an attack is “highly likely” — for more than two years. March 7. The National Health Service (NHS) revealed that there were 2,332 new cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Britain between October and December 2016. That statistic brought the total of new cases in 2016 to nearly 5,500. March 7. The managers of the cash-strapped Sandwell General Hospital near Birmingham said they would consider building a special kitchen for preparing halal meals for Muslim patients and staff. The move followed complaints about the quality of halal meals that the hospital has outsourced from local vendors. March 10. The BBC announced that it would begin outsourcing production of Songs of Praise, a Sunday worship program that has been produced in-house for 55 years. Critics of the move said they feared that Songs of Praise will lose its Christian focus in favor of Islam. Anglican priest Lynda Rose said a recent Songs of Praise episode featuring a segment about the Muslim faith, including Church of England children visiting a mosque, exemplified the “Islamization of the BBC.” More than 6,000 people signed an online petition calling for MPs to investigate the BBC after it appointed Fatima Salaria as the BBC’s head of religious programming — the second Muslim in a row to hold the post. March 11. Britain’s foreign aid budget was accused of funding at least two dozen Palestinian schools, some of which are named after terrorists and murderers, openly promote terrorism and encourage pupils to see child killers as role models.

March 11. Islamic preachers may be asked to begin delivering their sermons in English under measures being prepared to rid Britain of hate preaching. The Telegraphreported that the government’s counter-extremism taskforce is working on the plans amid concern that preaching in foreign languages enforces divisions between Islam and mainstream British society. March 12. An Islamic bookstore in Alum Rock, a predominately Muslim suburb of Birmingham that has produced 10% of all of Britain’s convicted terrorists, was found to be openly selling books promoting jihad. March 14. A father who described himself as “Anglo-Saxon” lost a legal battle to prevent his Muslim ex-wife from sending their 10-year-old son to an Islamic secondary school. The man, who was not named for legal reasons, said he wanted to prevent his son from attending a “school inside a mosque” on the grounds that he would be “marginalized” by his son if he enrolled at the London-based school. The man’s lawyer said that the mother and father had “different world views” and that it was client’s wish that his son be educated in a “neutral” environment. The man had converted to Islam but renounced his faith following the separation. A High Court judge dismissed the man’s appeal, ruling that the man would not be marginalized by his son. March 17. The former owners of a bookstore in Bradford apologized after copies of the Koran and other Islamic literature were found in a garbage dumpster outside the store. Police were called to the store after a group of Muslim males began abusing the staff. The imbroglio began after the bookstore’s 80-year-old owner decided to close down his business, and the new owners gave him a month to move out the stock, which included a number of Korans and other Islamic books. March 17. Zameer Ghumra, a 37-year-old Leicester pharmacist, was arrested after showing a beheading video to two young children. He was charged with distributing terrorist publications under section two of the Terrorism Act 2006. March 18. The BBC apologized after a tweet from the BBC Asian Network account asked, “What is the right punishment for blasphemy?” The tweet provoked criticism that the BBC appeared to be endorsing harsh restrictions on speech. In an apology posted on Twitter, the network said it had intended to debate concerns about blasphemy on social media in Pakistan. “We never intended to imply that blasphemy should be punished,” a spokesperson said. March 19. A British jihadist reportedly used social welfare payments to move his family to Syria to join the Islamic State. Shahan Choudhury, 30, who was radicalized at Belmarsh Prison while serving an 18-month sentence for stabbing to death a 17-year-old hospital worker over an alleged £15 ($18) drug debt, vanished from his apartment in London and has since used social media to urge other British Muslims to carry out terror attacks in the UK. March 20. Mohammed Karamat, 45, an imam at a mosque in Coventry who assaulted four children as young as nine, was spared jail time. Magistrates watched footage of Karamat twisting a child’s arm, slapping a child, and using a pen to stab a child and pricking a child’s hand with the lid of a pen. He was filmed attacking the children during a six-day period. Karamat, who admitted to four counts of assault by beating, was ordered to do 100 hours unpaid work. March 21. Minister for Higher Education, Jo Johnson, ordered British universities to include a clear commitment to freedom of speech in their governance documents to counter the culture of censorship and so-called safe spaces. Johnson said that universities had a “legal duty” to ensure as far as practicable that freedom of speech is secured for “members, students, employees and visiting speakers.” University premises should therefore not be “denied to any individual or body on any grounds connected with their beliefs or views, policy or objective.” March 22. Khalid Masood, 52, drove a car at pedestrians on London’s Westminster Bridge and, armed with two knives, stormed the parliamentary estate. He killed five people and injured more than 50 before he was shot dead by police. Masood, a convert to Islam, was born in Kent as Adrian Elms. He was unemployed at the time of the attack and had been living on social welfare benefits. Masood, who had previous convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offenses, was reportedly radicalized in prison. March 23. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Westminster attack. “The perpetrator of the attacks yesterday in front of the British parliament in London is an Islamic State soldier and he carried out the operation in response to calls to target citizens of the coalition,” the group’s Amaq news agency said in a statement. March 23. Prime Minister Theresa May said that it would be “wrong” to describe the jihadist attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament as “Islamic terrorism.” Instead, she said, it should be referred to as “Islamist terrorism” and “a perversion of a great faith.” March 25. Police investigating the Westminster attack concluded that Khalid Masood acted entirely alone for reasons that may never be known. “We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this,” deputy assistant Metropolitan police commissioner Neil Basu said. Meanwhile, British security services reportedly do not like the term “lone wolf” because they feel it glamorizes an attacker. They prefer using “lone actor” instead. March 25. An estimated 400 home-grown jihadis have returned to the United Kingdom after fighting in Syria, but only 54 of those have been prosecuted, according to a Mail on Sunday investigation, which also discovered that some returned jihadis are roaming free on the streets of Britain. March 28. Kevin Lane, a convicted murderer who spent 20 years in British prisons, including HMP Woodhill and HMP Frankland, told the BBC that he saw many inmates pressured to convert to Islam and carry out attacks on other prisoners. “One man boiled fat and poured it over someone’s head because of an insult to Islam,” he said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: “The allegations put forward by the former prisoner are historic.” March 31. A new biography of Prince Charles revealed that the heir to the British throne tried to halt the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan to “honor” Ramadan. He made the plea in an “urgent call” to William Farish, the American ambassador to London, four weeks into the huge military operation launched after the 9/11 terror attacks. Farish recalled: “Prince Charles asked me if it would be possible to stop the invasion to honor Ramadan, and if I could convey that request to President Bush.” The ambassador replied that it would be difficult to halt a military invasion already in full swing, but the prince allegedly protested: “But Americans can do anything!” Farish asked: “Sir, are you really serious?” Prince Charles replied: “Yes I am.” APRIL 2017 April 1. The British Home office stripped Sufiyan Mustafa, 22, of his UK passport after he traveled to Syria to fight with jihadists. Mustafa is the youngest son of the cleric Abu Hamza, who was sentenced to life in prison in the United States after being convicted of terrorism charges. Mustafa complained that he is now stateless and stranded in Syria. April 1. Frankland Prison in County Durham became the first of its kind to open “a prison within a prison” to isolate Islamic extremists. Convicted terrorists are to be moved to a “jihadist prison block” to reduce the risk of other inmates being radicalized. April 5. A BBC investigation found that online services in Britain are charging divorced Muslim women thousands of pounds to take part in “halala” Islamic marriages. Halala involves the woman marrying a stranger, consummating the marriage and then getting a divorce, after which she is able to remarry her first husband. Some Muslims believe that halala is the only way a couple who have been divorced, and wish to reconcile, can remarry. The BBC reported that women who seek halala services are at risk of being financially exploited, blackmailed and even sexually abused. One man, advertising halala services on Facebook, told an undercover BBC reporter posing as a divorced Muslim woman that she would need to pay £2,500 ($3,250) and have sex with him in order for the marriage to be “complete” — at which point he would divorce her. The man also said he had several other men working with him, one who he claims refused to issue a woman a divorce after a halala service was complete. April 5. The Salafi Independent School, an Islamic private school in Small Heath, was found to have placed an advertisement for a male-only science teacher. Although the advertisement, which breached the Equalities Act, was retracted, the headmaster claimed that the role must be occupied by a male teacher because of “religious observance reasons.” The decision prompted calls for the school to be investigated, amid fears it promotes “gender-based discrimination” and threatens to “undermine British values.” April 6. Ummariyat Mirza, a 21-year-old from Birmingham, was charged with planning to carry out a jihadist attack with a knife. He was also charged with possessing a bomb-making guide, the Anarchist Cookbook, and an extremist document called the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook. Police also charged Zainub Mirza, a 23-year-old from Bordesley Green, Birmingham, with sending Islamic State propaganda videos and executions to others to encourage jihadist attacks. April 7. The Food Standards Agency launched an investigation into the Malik Food Group, one of Britain’s largest halal slaughterhouses, over allegations of animal cruelty after an undercover video showed a slaughterman repeatedly sawing at the necks of sheep with a knife as they passed down a conveyor belt. The animals appeared not to have been killed instantly and some were seen heaving and jumping as they went down the line. More than 100 million animals are killed in the UK every year using the halal method, which forbids stunning animals prior to having their throats cut. April 10. Walsall Council backed out of a pilot project to introduce voter identification measures at elections amid concerns over how staff would handle Muslim women wearing veils. Conservative leader Mike Bird said the idea was “more trouble than it’s worth” and may lead to “confrontation” at polling stations. The government is planning to run the pilot schemes at local elections in 2018. April 10. Azad Ali, an Islamist who has said that he supports killing British soldiers, was named a director of Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend), a controversial Muslim pressure group which advises the British government. Ali said that the jihadist attack at Westminster on March 22, 2017 was not an act of terrorism. April 11. The Charity Commission, which regulates charities in England and Wales, asked Islamic Relief to explain why it invited a hardline Muslim preacher to star in a fundraising tour of Britain. Yasir Qadhi, a Saudi-educated American academic, has been recorded telling students that killing homosexuals and stoning adulterers was part of Islam. Qadhi, who featured in an eight-city tour, described Islamic punishments such as cutting off the hands of thieves as “very beneficial to society.” April 13. Twenty-nine people, facing more than 170 charges relating to the sexual exploitation of 18 children, appeared at Huddersfield Magistrates Court.

April 14. Sainsbury’s and Asda, two of Britain’s largest supermarket chains, refusedto sell Easter eggs that tell the story of Christianity. Both chains, however, sold eggs that are not specifically Christian, including a halal version made by the Belgian firm Guylian. Stephen Green, of the lobby group Christian Voice, said: “You are whitewashing the Christian message out of Christian holidays. It’s difficult to find any explicitly Christian products, like Christmas cards, in supermarkets.” April 15. Pupils at the Kilmorie Primary School in Lewisham, London were takenon a school trip to the Lewisham Islamic Centre where they met Shakeel Begg, an imam whom the High Court recently described as an “extremist” who “promotes and encourages religious violence.” Mr. Justice Haddon-Cave warned that Begg’s role as imam put him in a position to “plant the seed of Islamic extremism in a young mind.” Begg praised the children for their desire to learn about Islam. April 22. Mohammed Aslam, an independent candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester, caused controversy after he delivered his election manifesto completely in Urdu on the BBC. Janice Atkinson, an independent member of the European Parliament, tweeted: “If you can’t/won’t speak English you have no right to stand in elections. You cannot represent our people, culture and values. Stand down.” April 22. Nadir Syed, a 24-year-old jihadist serving life in prison for plotting to behead someone in a jihadist attack, won a High Court case which ruled that his human rights were breached after he was placed in solitary confinement.

The manifesto also proposed to outlaw Sharia law and make it a legal obligation to report female genital mutilation to police. April 25. Prime Minister Theresa May was accused of ignoring Muslim voters after she scheduled the general election in the middle of Ramadan. Muslim politicians from Labour and the Scottish National Party said they feared reduced voter turnout among Muslims on June 8, during Ramadan, which took place between May 16 and June 14. April 26. Wealthy Pakistani asylum seekers with £250,000 ($325,000) in savings, who claimed asylum in Britain before taking £40,000-a-year in benefits, were each sentenced to ten months in prison. Syed Zaidi, 41, and his wife Rizwana Kamal, 40, claimed they were being persecuted at home so flew to Britain with their family asking the Home Office for food and shelter. The couple, who have three children, were given free accommodation and other welfare payments worth £150,000 over four years at taxpayers’ expense, despite having more than £250,000 saved in seven different bank accounts. They then bought two cars and moved into a Victorian house near Manchester, but were prosecuted after a whistleblower called the Home Office. April 27. The Church of England said that British children should be required to learn about Islam. Derek Holloway of the Church of England’s education office said that Christian parents who do not want their children to learn about Islam should not be allowed to withdraw their children from religious education lessons. At present, parents can insist that their children take no part in religious education lessons and do not have to provide a reason. Holloway said that parents with “fundamentalist” Christian beliefs, who did not want their children to learn about other world views, risked leaving pupils with little understanding of Islam and without the skills to live in a modern and diverse Britain. Holloway did not say whether Muslim children should be required to learn about Christianity and Judaism. April 27. Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali, 27, was arrested on suspicion of preparing a jihadist attack near the British Parliament.

Jade Campbell, a 26-year-old convert to Islam from West London, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for possessing materials likely to be useful to a person planning or committing an act of terror and making a false statement to obtain a passport. Police searching her mobile phone found a copy of the al-Qaeda article, “Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom,” which contained step-by-step instructions on how to make a homemade bomb. Another article concerned sending and receiving encrypted messages. Internet searches found on her phone included, “How to join ISIS” and “How to marry someone from ISIS,” as well as searches for flights to Istanbul and border crossings between Turkey and Syria. April 29. Mohamed Amoudi, 21, was arrested on charges of planning a jihadist attack on a crowded tourist area of central London.

May 3. Damon Smith, a 20-year-old convert to Islam, was found guilty of making a bomb filled with ball bearings and leaving it on a subway train in London. Jurors at the Old Baily court were told that Smith had downloaded the al-Qaeda article, “Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom.” The court also heard that Smith had a keen interest in Islam, guns and explosives, and had collected pictures of extremists, including the alleged terrorist behind the 2015 Paris terror attacks. Smith, who suffers from autism, admitted to making the device but claimed he only meant it as a prank. May 3. The trial began of four Muslim men who gang-raped a 16-year-old girl in Ramsgate, Kent.

A divorce practice that allows Muslim men instantly to terminate an Islamic marriage simply by repeating the word talaq, meaning divorce, three times to his wife, has been described as “really common” among Muslims in Britain, according to The Sunday Times. Women cannot use the method, known as “triple talaq.” Under civil law in Britain, Islamic marriages are not acknowledged, leaving women with little power to escape an unhappy or abusive marriage, or to defend their interests in court when a marriage breaks down. May 14. Mohan Singh, founder of the Sikh Awareness Society, said that Muslim grooming gangs have been allowed to prosper in Britain because the authorities are afraid they will be labelled racist if they speak out. May 17. The first episode of the BBC’s drama on Muslim rape gangs in Rochdale called “Three Girls” was broadcast with widespread approval by the mainstream media.

May 17. Muhammad Rabbani, the international director of Cage, a controversial group critical of British anti-terrorism laws, was charged with willfully obstructing, or seeking to frustrate, a search under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which gives border officials sweeping search powers.

The American FBI had warned British authorities in January 2017 that Abedi was planning an attack in the UK, but he was evidently not judged to be a threat. May 23. Prime Minister Theresa May announced after the Manchester bombing that the armed forces would be deployed on British streets to boost security. May said that military personnel would be positioned at key sites to free up police for patrols. May 23. The Manchester-born singer Morrissey criticized British politicians for their reaction to the bombing in his hometown, saying they were too politically correct to admit that the concert bombing was the work of an Islamist extremist. “In modern Britain, everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private,” the singer wrote on his Facebook page. “Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections.” May 24. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said that Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was “a terrorist, not a Muslim.” May 26. MI5, Britain’s domestic security agency, revealed that it had identified 23,000 jihadist extremists living in the country. About 3,000 people from the group are judged to pose an immediate threat. They are under investigation or active monitoring in 500 operations being run by police and intelligence services. The 20,000 others have featured in previous inquiries and are categorized as posing a “residual risk.” The number was more than seven times higher than previously known. May 27. Manchester bomber Salman Abedi used taxpayer-funded student loans and benefits to bankroll his terror plot, according to the Telegraph. Abedi is believed to have received thousands of pounds in state funding in the run-up to the attack, even while he was overseas receiving bomb-making training. May 28. A 23-year-old Libyan “trainee pilot” was arrested in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, as part of the investigation into the jihadist network behind Manchester bomber Salman Abedi. May 29.

May 31. A new book, “Talking about Terrorism,” urges schoolchildren as young as seven to “write a letter to a terrorist” to help understand their motives. The book describes the indiscriminate mass murder of innocent members of the public as a “type of war.” It tells children of primary school age that terrorists kill people because they believe they are being treated “unfairly and not shown respect.” May 31. The findings of an investigation commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron into the foreign funding and support of jihadi groups may never be published, according to the Guardian.

The Home Office confirmed that the report would not necessarily be published because the contents are “very sensitive.” JUNE 2017 June 3. Khuram Shazad Butt, a 27-year-old Pakistani-born British citizen, Rachid Redouane, a 30-year-old who claimed to be Libyan and Moroccan and Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian, murdered eight people and injured 50 others in a jihadist attack on and around the London Bridge. The three assailants were shot dead by police. It was the third major jihadist attack in Britain in as many months. June 3. Khalid Al-Mathkour, chairman of Kuwait’s sharia council, and Essam Al-Fulaij, a Kuwaiti government figure known for his anti-Semitic diatribes, were listed as trustees of a UK-registered charity that is building a mosque in Sheffield, according to the Telegraph. They have helped channel almost £500,000 ($650,000) into the project from Kuwait. Another £400,000 ($525,000) has been donated to the charity, the Emaan Trust, by a Qatari organization. The stated aim of the new mosque, which will have a capacity for 500 worshippers, is to “promote and teach Islamic morals and values to new Muslim generations.” June 4. Prime Minister Theresa May, after the London Bridge attack, said there was “far too much tolerance of extremism” in Britain and promised to step up the fight against Islamic terrorism. “Enough is enough,” she said. May also asserted that the jihadists held to an ideology that was a perversion of true Islam: “It is an ideology that claims our Western values of freedom, democracy and human rights are incompatible with the religion of Islam [Correct]. It is an ideology that is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth [Incorrect].” June 6. Khuram Shazad Butt, one of the London Bridge attackers, was known to British authorities, according to the Telegraph. He had appeared in a Channel 4 documentary about British extremists called “The Jihadis Next Door.” Butt was also filmed at events attended by questionable Islamic preachers, and had tried to go to Syria to become a jihadist there.

Aslam admitted to dangerous driving and attempting to inflict intentional grievous bodily harm. June 14. Shamim Ahmed, a 24-year-old Bangladeshi from Tower Hamlets, East London, was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to join the Islamic State in Syria. During his trial, Ahmed pointed his finger at Judge John Bevan QC and warned him that he, Ahmed, would continue to “wage jihad”: “Give me 20 years, I will come out the enemy.” June 15. New statistics showed that during the year up to March 2017, 304 people were arrested for terrorism-related offenses — a 20% increase compared to the previous 12 months. Combined with those people held since March, total arrests in 2017 were expected to top the previous record of 315, set in 2015. June 19. Darren Osborne, a 47-year-old unemployed father of four, drove a van into a group of worshippers close to the Finsbury Park Mosque in North London. One person was killed and eight others injured in the attack, which police said was premeditated. Osborne was “self-radicalized into his extremist hatred of Muslims,” according to the Guardian. June 20. Armed police were deployed to the Neolithic Stonehenge to protect thousands of pagans, who were celebrating the summer solstice, from jihadist attacks. David Spofforth of the Pagan Federation said it was “very sad” that armed police were necessary: “I am not saying I am welcoming this, I sadly accept it. But you just have to look at the events such as at Finsbury Park, a peaceful religious gathering where people suffered so much by the actions of one hate-filled individual.” June 22. A Muslim woman sued her former employers after allegedly being ordered to remove her black headscarf because the garment had “terrorist affiliations.” The estate agent had been working for Harvey Dean in Bury for almost a year when she says managers took issue with her hijab. The woman said she felt “singled out” as the only Muslim woman in the office and claimed the company discriminated against her on the basis of both religion and gender. June 23. Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, the schools regulator, vowed to crack down on Islamic extremism in British schools. She said that school children must be equipped with the “knowledge and resilience” required to combat the violent rhetoric “peddled” by hate preachers who “put hatred in their hearts and poison in their minds.” June 24. More than 40 foreign jihadists have used human rights laws to remain in Britain, according to an unpublished report delayed by the Home Office. The study, a copy of which was leaked to the Telegraph, describes how lawyers, funded by legal aid, have successfully prevented foreign-born terror suspects from being sent back to their home countries. June 25. Michael Adebolajo, who together with Michael Adebowale murdered British soldier Lee Rigby outside Woolwich barracks in south-east London in May 2013, is now regarded as the most dangerous prisoner in the British penal system, according to prison sources. A prison officer described him as “violent, unpredictable and a major danger to other prisoners.” He has also radicalized dozens of inmates, including non-Muslim prisoners who are said to have converted to Islam and sworn allegiance to the Islamic State. June 27. Muslims launched an online petition to oppose a new “veil policy” at John Thursby Community College, in Burnley, Lancashire. The school announced plans for a universal-length headscarf that some Muslims said is too short and not sufficiently modest. Previously, girls were free to choose any length they pleased. Some feel that the move is aimed at deterring girls from wearing headscarves at all. June 28. A trial began in London of four jihadists — Naweed Ali, 29, Tahir Aziz, 38, Khobaib Hussain, 25, and Mohibur Rahman, 32 — for allegedly plotting a knife rampage on British soil. The men, who called themselves “The Musketeers,” were accused of sharing “the same radical belief in violent jihad.” Prosecutors said the terror plot involved a samurai sword and a meat cleaver with the word “Kafir” (unbeliever) scratched onto the blade. The four men were arrested after weapons, ammunition, and a pipe bomb were found in Ali’s car during a counter-terrorism operation in Birmingham. June 29. Three men were arrested in the Armagh and Coalisland areas of Northern Ireland for displaying anti-Muslim posters and stickers. Police said the material — which included the slogan “Rapefugees Not Welcome” — was likely to stir up “racial hatred.” June 30. Tarik Chadlioui, a 43-year-old Moroccan cleric living in Birmingham with his wife and eight children, was accused of recruiting jihadists for the Islamic State. Chadlioui, a Salafist, is believed to be the spiritual leader of an Islamic State cell in Spain and is wanted in several European countries. Chadlioui, also known as Tarik ibn Ali, is said to have formed links with jihadist groups that aim to impose Sharia law in Europe. JULY 2017 July 1. Two men, both aged 21, one from Leicester and one from Birmingham, were arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of terrorism offenses after arriving on a flight from Turkey. Two days earlier, a 21-year-old woman was arrested, also on suspicion of terrorism offenses, as she arrived at the same airport on a flight from Istanbul. In May, a 30-year-old man was arrested at Heathrow, on suspicion of preparing for terrorist acts after he stepped off a plane from Istanbul. July 2. Sahnoun Daifallah, a 50-year-old Algerian chemist, sentenced to nine years in prison for contaminating supermarket food with his own excrement, avoided deportation for seven years. Daifallah came to Britain in 1999 and was granted refugee status two years later. In May 2008, he used a weed killer spray bottle to contaminate food with a mixture of urine and feces at several supermarkets in Gloucestershire. Damage to the businesses was estimated at £700,000 ($900,000). Daifallah was told he would be deported in 2010, but he remains in Britain, apparently due to bureaucratic incompetence. July 2. A new report — “The Missing Muslims: Unlocking British Muslim Potential for the Benefit of All” — concluded: “It is of great importance that British-born imams, who have a good understanding of British culture and who fluently speak English, are encouraged and appointed in preference to overseas alternatives.” Imams were told they must take a “stronger stance” against persecution of others, including Jews, Christians and other Muslims. July 3. BBC One broadcast a documentary, — “The Betrayed Girls” — about the Rochdale child-exploitation ring, in which dozens of underage girls were raped and trafficked by a gang of men from Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the 90-minute film — which featured interviews with individuals from the case — former Detective Constable Maggie Oliver and Chief Prosecutor Nazir Afzal provided insights into the failings of police and other official bodies to investigate the large-scale sexual abuse, which occurred between 2008 and 2009. July 3. Haroon Syed, 19, from West London, was sentenced to sixteen-and-a-half years in prison for plotting to attack an Elton John concert in London on the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Syed admitted to researching potential targets on the internet, including an Elton John concert in Hyde Park and Oxford Street, a busy shopping district. He also used the internet to try to obtain weapons to use in a possible attack, and used social media to approach people he believed were supporters of Islamic State. In one message, he wrote: “So after some damage with machine gun then do martyrdom…that’s what im planning to do.” July 3. Armed police swooped down on a Megabus from London after a “disruptive” man, shouting “praise Allah” and “something’s about to happen,” caused a driver to pull over and evacuate worried passengers. A Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police spokesman said: “The bus stopped on Central Park Drive where a 47-year-old man from Manchester was detained under the Mental Health Act. He will now undergo a mental health assessment.” July 3. Britain’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, deployed agents to Ireland to monitor jihadists there. A source interviewed by the Irish Star said: “The British think our security here is too lax and MI5 are here to try and spot any problems in Dublin before they get to England.” July 4. The National Health Service (NHS) recorded 5,391 new cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) during the past year. Almost half the victims were women and girls living in London. One-third were women and girls born in Somalia, while 112 cases were UK-born nationals. Although FGM was banned in the UK in 1985, not a single person has been convicted of the crime. July 4. Northern Ireland’s lead prosecutor, Barra McGrory, said he has no regrets about charging Pastor James McConnell for hate speech for making “grossly offensive” remarks during a May 2014 sermon in which he said that Islam is “satanic” and “heathen.” McConnell was acquitted of the charges in January 2016. McGrory said: “There are laws which control and limit free speech in certain contexts. It’s a prosecutor’s nightmare trying to make these finely balanced decisions on whether or not such comments do or do not stray across the line.” July 5. A new report — “Foreign Funded Islamist Extremism in the UK” from the Henry Jackson Society — highlighted the need for a public inquiry into the foreign-based funding of Islamist extremism. The report’s conclusions include: “The foreign funding for Islamist extremism in Britain primarily comes from governments and government-linked foundations based in the Gulf, as well as Iran. Foremost among these has been Saudi Arabia, which since the 1960s has sponsored a multimillion dollar effort to export Wahhabi Islam across the Islamic world, including to Muslim communities in the West.” July 7. A 17-year-old boy who grew up in a Christian family and converted to Islam allegedly plotted a “lone wolf” attack on a Justin Bieber concert in Cardiff. Counter-terrorism police said the boy, who was not identified because of his age, became radicalized online. The attack was to take place on June 30 as more than 40,000 fans descended on the Principality Stadium for the concert. The boy was arrested during a raid on his rural home hours before the performance. July 8. Nazim Ali, a director of the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC), claimed that the victims of the fire at the Grenfell Tower “were murdered” by “Zionists” who fund the Conservative party. July 9. Zohair Tomari, 20, was sentenced to 12 years and nine months years in prison for raping a 17-year-old girl and sexually assaulting two other girls, aged 13 and 14. Tomari, who claims to be from Morocco but is believed to be from Syria, raped the 17-year-old after plying her with alcohol. After he was granted bail, he went on to attack the two younger girls. July 12. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that the government would not publish the much-delayed report, commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron in November 2015, into the funding of Islamist extremism in Britain. Opposition parties condemned the government for not publishing the report. They said that the decision appeared to be intended to bury any criticism of Saudi Arabia. July 12. British Transport Police released a CCTV image of an elderly Muslim man suspected of having sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl on a train between Preston and Blackburn. A police spokesman said: “We do not tolerate any form of unwanted sexual behavior and we are working to identify and trace the offender.” July 14. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, Britain’s senior police officer, said that a “very large number of plots” have been foiled during the last few years. “Some of them were very close, we would say, to an attack, very close.” Pressed on exactly how many attacks have been thwarted, she said that five had been averted in “just the last few weeks.” July 14. Jahed Choudhury, 24, thought to be one of the first British Muslims to be in a same-sex marriage, said that since his wedding, he had received death threats online and abuse on the streets: “The worst messages say, ‘the next time I see you in the streets, I’m going to throw acid in your face.’ Even if I walk down the streets, I have people spitting on me and calling me pig.” He added: “I’ve been brought up Muslim and the Koran mentions you cannot be gay and Muslim. But this is how I have chosen to live my life. I will never get rid of my faith.” July 16. Aniso Abulkadir, 18, from Harrow, London, claimed that she and her friends were racially assaulted at the Baker Street Tube station. After reporting the incident to police, Abulkadir shared a photo of the alleged attacker online and described how he attempted to remove her headscarf before hitting her. When the picture went viral, the man in the image identified himself on Twitter and refuted the allegations. Pawel Uczciwek, 28, from London, said he was protecting his girlfriend and attempting to defuse what he called a “racist attack from three random females.” Uczciwek wrote: “The police are fully cooperating with me and will be able to obtain CCTV footage showing the three women attempting to attack my partner because we are in an interracial relationship.” July 19. Jihadists linked to the Islamic State called on supporters to carry out “lone wolf” attacks on Jewish businesses and places of worship in Britain. The threat, posted on a pro-ISIS social media site called Lone Mujahid, included a list of every synagogue in Britain, as well as a list of Jewish shops and delicatessens across the country. July 20. Rachida Serroukh, 37, a single mother of three, filed a lawsuit against her daughter’s school, the prestigious Holland Park School, dubbed the “socialist Eton,” after being told she could not wear a face veil on its premises. The school said it is a safety issue to be able to identify all of those on school premises. Serroukh’s lawyer said it was a “straightforward” test case of religious discrimination. “The government constantly talks about British values,” he said. “To me, those values include diversity and multiculturalism.” July 21. The British government lacks reliable immigration statistics and has no way to track who is entering or leaving the country, according to a report released by the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. July 22. A freedom of information request revealed that Anjem Choudary, an Islamist serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for urging support of the Islamic State, has received more than £140,000 ($180,000) in taxpayer-funded legal aid for his unsuccessful bid to avoid prison. As his lawyers continue to file claims, the figure is set to rise. The father-of-five has claimed up to £500,000 ($640,000) in benefits, to which he has referred as a “Jihad seeker’s allowance.” July 22. Zana Hassan, a 29-year-old Iraqi who has been living illegally in Britain for nine years, avoided deportation after he stormed into a Methodist church and threatened churchgoers. “I will kill you and kill all the English,” he shouted. The Crown Prosecution Service deemed the offense a “low-level disorder,” which allowed Hassan to avoid time in jail. Hassan walked free after Home Office officials failed to seek a deportation order. July 25. Mujahid Arshid, 33, was charged with kidnapping, raping and murdering Celine Dookhran, a 19-year-old Indian Muslim, in a suspected “honor killing” in London. Prosecutor Binita Roscoe told the Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court that the teenager was of Indian Muslim heritage and had started a relationship with an Arab Muslim man. July 25. An inmate at a prison in Norfolk shouted, “This is for Allah” before slashing the throat of a guard. After being moved to another prison, the man attacked a second officer. An official source said that the suspect was not serving a sentence for a terror-related offense, a statement that raised the possibility that he had been radicalized in prison. July 26. A 15-year-old girl was raped at a railway station in Birmingham. She was then raped again by the driver of a passing car she flagged down to help her. Police described the first attacker as an “Asian” man in his early 20s and of a skinny build. Police said the second man was also “Asian,” in his 20s and of a large build. July 27. Victoria Wasteney, a Christian NHS worker, lost a protracted legal battle, for having shared her faith at work with a Muslim colleague, Enya Nawaz. Wasteney, the former Head of Forensic Occupational Therapy at St. John Howard hospital in East London, was suspended in June 2013 for “gross misconduct” after Nawaz complained that Wasteney had been attempting to convert her to Christianity. Wasteney said she was surprised by the allegations because she thought she and her colleague had become friends during the 18 months they worked together. July 27. An official report revealed that Omar Deghayes, a former detainee at Guantánamo Bay who was paid £1 million ($1.3 million) in compensation by the British Government for the time he spent at the detention center, passed some of the money on to teenage jihadists who later died fighting in Syria. Deghayes is alleged to have paid young Muslim boys to attend a gym where children were “vulnerable to radicalization.” The Serious Case Review revealed that police and other authorities were warned about a network of teenage jihadists attending the gym, but that those concerns were ignored. July 27. Four members of the Rochdale sexual grooming gang received £1million ($1.3 million) in taxpayer-funded legal aid to fight their deportation to Pakistan. Lawyers for Shabir Ahmed, Abdul Aziz, Adil Khan and Abdul Rauf, pedophiles who raped and abused girls as young as 13, are leveraging Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights: “Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.” July 28. Iman FM, a radio station in Sheffield, was taken off the air by Ofcom, the media regulator, after it broadcast 25 hours of lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki, a former leader of al-Qaeda who was killed in an American drone strike. Ofcom said Iman FM was guilty of “extremely serious breaches” of the broadcasting code by airing material that “was likely to incite or encourage the commission of crime or to lead to disorder.” July 30. Mubarek Ali, the ringleader of sexual grooming gang in Telford, was told he would be released from prison just five years into a 22-year sentence. Ali was one of seven men convicted at Worcester Crown Court in 2013 for preying on girls as young as 13. Telford MP Lucy Allan condemned the decision, which could allow Ali back into a community where his victims continue to live. July 31. Amin Mohmed, 24, Mohammed Patel, 20, and Faruq Patel, 19, were sentenced to between 18 and 42 weeks at a young offenders’ institution after rampaging through Liverpool city center and attacking strangers because they were white “non-Muslims.” One of the men stopped Gary Bohanna and said, “I’m a Muslim, what are you?” When Bohanna answered, “I’m a Christian,” the attacker shouted, “Why aren’t you a Muslim?” before punching him twice. The group then encountered St. Helens councilor Paul Lynch and his girlfriend. Faruq filmed Mohmed punching Lynch with a “sickening blow” that could be “seen and heard.” The judge said: “References to the fact he was not a Muslim were made and you appeared to justify your actions because of certain beliefs you held.” AUGUST 2017 August 9. Seventeen men and one woman were found guilty of involvement in a sex grooming network in Newcastle upon Tyne that plied vulnerable women and girls with drink and drugs before assaulting them. In a series of four trials at Newcastle crown court, juries found the men guilty of nearly 100 offenses — including rape, human trafficking, conspiracy to incite prostitution and drug supply — between 2011 and 2014. The victims, all females between 13 and 25, were targeted because they were vulnerable and less likely to complain about their circumstances, the prosecution argued. The court heard accounts of young women who were drugged before waking up to find themselves undressed, having been sexually assaulted. August 9. Referrals by members of the public to the British government’s counter-terrorism scheme doubled since the jihadist attacks in London and Manchester. Police received around 200 referrals to the strategy known as “Prevent” from members of the public since March, when Britain suffered the first of four deadly attacks, according to Simon Cole, the National Police Chief Council’s lead spokesman on deradicalization efforts. August 10. Ken Macdonald, a former Crown Prosecution chief, said there was “a major problem in particular communities” of men viewing young white girls as “trash” and available for sex. He admitted that Muslim grooming gangs were not investigated “rigorously” enough because of political correctness. Speaking on the Today program on BBC Radio 4, he said there had been “past reluctance” to look into Muslim men who had been targeting white girls. August 10. More than 700 women and girls were identified as potential victims of sexual grooming in the North East of England and authorities expected the figure to rise following the conviction of a high-profile grooming gang. “I think there’s every likelihood that this is happening in every town and city across the country,” Chief Constable Ashman said. August 11. The former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans, warned that Britain is likely to face an Islamic terror threat for the next 30 years. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today program: “I think on the terrorism side we are at least 20 years into this. My guess is that we will still be dealing with the long tail in another 20 years’ time…. I think that we are going to be facing 20, 30 years of terrorist threats and therefore we need absolutely critically to persevere and just keep doing it.” August 17. Labour shadow minister Sarah Champion resigned after criticism over a newspaper article she wrote about grooming gangs. The Rotherham MP wrote that “Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls.” She apologized for her “extremely poor choice of words.” August 23. Nadeem Muhammad, a 43-year-old Pakistani national with an Italian passport, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for attempting to carry a pipe bomb onto a flight at Manchester Airport. Muhammed, who lives in Greater Manchester, was arrested on January 30 but was later released and allowed to travel because officers did not believe the device was real. He was re-arrested when he returned to Britain on February 11 and charged with possessing an improvised explosive device. “Despite extensive investigation, Nadeem Muhammad’s motive for attempting to take this device on to a plane remains unknown,” said Sue Hemming, the head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division in the Crown Prosecution Service. August 28. Teachers concerned about extremism in schools reported up to three warnings a day with a government terrorism hot-line. Staff raised 1,180 alerts with the Department of Education in two and a half years, making 741 phone-calls and sending 439 emails. The concerns included pupils being vulnerable to radicalization and staff members influencing their classes. August 29. Ricardo McFarlane, a 30-year-old convert to Islam accused of preaching sharia law in central London, refused to stand for the judge at Southwark Crown Court. Defense attorney Roy Hedlam said: “Because of his religious belief he believes there is only one person who he should bow to.” Judge Martin Beddoe responded: “That may be, but this is not a court of religion, this is a secular court and it expects to be treated with respect.” McFarlane complied. August 29. Sadia Malik, a 36-year-old primary school teacher from Wales, was charged with disseminating terrorist materials after she shared links to YouTube videos featuring Omar Bakri Mohammed, an Islamic extremist. She was accused of promoting a banned hate group and encouraging Muslims to sacrifice all their money to help establish a worldwide Islamic Caliphate. Her husband, Sajid Idris, 34, had previously been charged with four counts of disseminating terrorist publications as part of the same investigation. SEPTEMBER 2017 September 1. Britain is home to up to 35,000 “Islamist fanatics,” more than any other country in Europe, according to European Union’s counter-terrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove. September 1. Mike Adamson, Chief Executive of the British Red Cross, wrote: “There is a risk that…an organization with the words ‘British’ and ‘Cross’ in its title is confused with a Christian, establishment organization.” He added: “We are nowhere near as diverse as we need to be in our volunteer base, our staffing or our leadership…that is why, as CEO, I am personally leading our inclusion and diversity strategy.” September 1. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 26, was charged with a terror offense after he attacked police outside Buckingham Palace with a sword and “ranted” that the “Queen and her soldiers will all be in hellfire.” The British-born suspect, who is of Bangladeshi heritage, was accused of one charge of preparing terrorist acts, which carries a maximum charge of a life sentence. September 2. A Christian church in Wales was accused of a “lack of unity” after it rejected a Muslim group’s request to hold Koran studies in its hall. The Muslims wanted to use the hall in the Feed My Lambs Church for “Koran and cultural studies.” Reverend Roger Donaldson said: “We are not against Islam; no way. Everybody has the right to worship as they please. Feed My Lambs is used for Christian worship.” September 2. Rabar Mala, a 32-year-old illegal immigrant from Iraq, was chargedwith supplying hundreds of SIM cards to Islamic State jihadists to set up social media accounts. Mala allegedly provided 437 cards and phone numbers to jihadists in Iraq and Syria so that they could have a platform to post propaganda online. September 2. Sarah Champion, a former Labour MP, who had said that the British left was turning a blind eye to Muslim sexual grooming gangs for fear of being branded racist, also said that many Labour members and politicians based in London had “never been challenged by a reality that’s different” from their “multicultural world.” She resigned under pressure after she wrote in an op-ed: “Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls.” September 3. Thousands of schools in Britain are allowing girls as young as five to wear religious headscarves as part of their uniform policies, according to The Sunday Times. The growing trend has been criticized by campaigners who pointed out the headscarf is supposed to be worn by a girl when she reaches puberty, not as a child. September 4. Robbie Travers, a 21-year-old law student at Edinburgh University, was investigated for a hate crime after he allegedly mocked the Islamic State on social media. After the U.S. Air Force attacked an Islamic State stronghold in Afghanistan in April, Travers wrote on Facebook: “I’m glad we could bring these barbarians a step closer to collecting their 72 virgins.” A fellow student, Esme Allman, claimed that Travers breached the student code of conduct with his comments. Travers ultimately was exonerated. September 5. Three members of a Muslim sex gang, who used drugs to turn abuse victims into addicts and forced them to have sex if they wanted more drugs, were sentenced to a total of 56 years in prison. Seventeen men and one woman from Newcastle were sentenced for crimes including rape, sexual assault, inciting girls into prostitution and dealing drugs. They were part of a network of nearly 40 men, including Pakistani, Indian, Iranian, Iraqi, Bangladeshi and Turkish nationals, who preyed on approximately 100 girls. Prosecutor John Elvidge said the victims, who gave evidence in court, were white and British, and the male defendants were “all of Asian extraction;” but he insisted nevertheless that the crimes were not racially motivated. September 8. Michael Adebolajo, 32, who murdered the fusilier Lee Rigby, 25, in Woolwich, London, in 2013, demanded £100,000 ($133,000) after he lost his two front teeth when staff at Belmarsh Prison tried to restrain him. “The public will be rightly outraged at the thought of this offender claiming compensation from the taxpayer,” a Ministry of Justice spokesman said. September 9. Kamal Hanif, a counter-extremism expert appointed by the British government to rehabilitate schools involved in the “Trojan Horse” scandal, saidthat some teachers, particularly those who work in schools with a high proportion of Muslim students, are afraid of teaching about 9/11 because they fear a backlash from Muslim parents for being “Islamophobic.” September 10. The Ministry of Justice revealed that Muslim inmates at HMP Prison Send, a female prison in Surrey, will be provided with special outfits for when they are checked by sniffer dogs. The overalls will be given to female prisoners who follow Islam because many Muslims believe that dogs are “impure.” September 11. A Freedom of Information request revealed that Sammy Woodhouse, a woman sexually abused as a child by a grooming gang, was told by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), a government body, that she was not entitled to compensation because she “consented” to the sexual abuse. Woodhouse was 14 when she met 24-year-old Arshid Hussain, who was jailed in 2016. Hussain was one of three brothers behind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Woodhouse. He was jailed for 35 years for 23 offenses including indecent assault and rape. Woodhouse appealed the decision: “If an adult can privately think that it’s a child’s fault for being abused, beaten, raped, abducted, I think you’re in the wrong job.” September 11. TheCityUK, London’s top lobby group, urged the British government to prioritize Islamic finance to retain its status as Europe’s financial hub ahead of Brexit negotiations to exit the country from the European Union. A 32-page report showed that assets of British firms offering Islamic finance services surpassed $5 billion (£3.8 billion) in 2016, up 11% in two years. Britain was the first non-Muslim country to sell a bond that can be bought by Islamic investors. September 12. British Muslims are twice as likely to espouse anti-Semitic views, according to a survey produced by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research. “The prevalence of negativity towards Jews and Israel is, on average, twice as high among Muslims than the general population,” said the 85-page report. September 14. A Dundee woman on a city bus found a handwritten note pledging: “Sharia law will be for all human beings with Islam. The sword will be used to reach this goal.” The woman said that she believed the message to be “some sort of call to Jihad.” She added: “We just didn’t expect to find something saying that on a bus in Dundee.” September 15. A homemade bomb exploded during rush hour on a train at the Parsons Green tube station in West London and injured 30 people. The bomb, which failed to detonate properly, had been packed with knives, screws and shrapnel, as well as hundreds of grams of a homemade explosive known as TATP. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. Ahmed Hassan, an 18-year-old refugee from Iraq, was charged with attempted murder. September 18. Online jihadist propaganda attracts more clicks in Britain than in any other European country and the main internet companies are failing to curb it, according to the Policy Exchange think tank. The report, “The New Netwar,” said that the Islamic State, despite big military defeats in Syria and Iraq, is still producing, at a conservative estimate, about 100 items of new content each week, including execution videos and bomb-making instructions. The report also said that the jihadist online “ecosystem,” the core of which is rooted in the Telegram app, is resilient and reaches an audience of, at a minimum, tens of thousands of users in the UK. September 20. Muhammad, with variations in spelling, was the top name for baby boys in England and Wales in 2016. The name Muhammad was given to 7,084 boys in 2016, compared to 6,623 boys with the second-most popular name, Oliver. September 20. Shabir Ahmed, a 64-year-old inmate at Wakefield prison, was found guilty of repeatedly stomping on an elderly fellow inmate’s face and head after an argument about the March 2016 Brussels terror attacks, which left 32 victims dead and 340 injured. Ahmed flew into a rage when he heard 71-year-old James Palmer say that the bombers should be “eradicated.” Ahmed, a former taxi driver, is currently serving a 22-year-prison term for leading a sexual grooming gang in Rochdale. He was sentenced to a further 12 months in prison on top of the term he is already serving. September 22. Hussain Yousef, a 21-year-old fast food restaurant worker who arrived in Britain from Afghanistan in 2010 and lived in London, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison for recruiting jihadists for the Islamic State. Yousef had six Facebook accounts from which he posted Islamist propaganda and execution videos. He also shared a list claiming to be details of U.S. military personnel, including their addresses. Kingston Crown Court heard how Yousef, before becoming an enthusiastic supporter of the Islamic State, had been a gifted student who excelled at school. September 25. London Mayor Sadiq Khan revealed that since March 2017, police had foiled seven jihadist plots in the British capital. Those seven plots were in addition to the four successful attacks at Westminster, Borough Market, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green. Khan also criticized U.S. President Donald Trump for his “Muslim travel ban” and his “ignorant” views about Islam. Khan accused Trump of adopting the language of the Islamic State: “They say that there is a clash of civilizations, it is not possible to be a Muslim and a westerner, and the west hates us. And you are inadvertently playing their game, you are helping them.” September 25. Muhammad Rabbani, the director of Cage, a Muslim advocacy group critical of British anti-terrorism laws, was convicted of an offense at Heathrow Airport. Rabbani, 36, was stopped on November 20, 2016 after returning home from a wedding in Doha. He refused, citing privacy and civil rights, to give his pin number or the password to his laptop. Westminster Magistrates’ Court convicted him of one count of willfully obstructing a stop-and-search under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act. Schedule 7 gives officers their right to stop and search people “with or without suspicion.” Rabbani was sentenced to one year conditional discharge; he plans to appeal. September 25. Most British voters believe that Arabs have failed to integrate into British society, and that their presence has not been beneficial, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by the Council for Arab-British Understanding and the Arab News newspaper. Only 28% believe that migration from the Arab world has been beneficial to the UK, and 64% believe Arabs have failed to integrate. September 26. Zameer Ghumra, a 38-year-old pharmacist from Leicester, was accused of showing beheading videos to young boys and telling them that they “had to kill” anyone who insulted Islam. Nottingham Crown Court heard that Ghumra believed in a “very, very, very extreme” form of Islam. He used a rented house to teach children about jihad and told them that they were not allowed to have non-Muslim friends. Ghumra also asked them to choose between going to Iraq or Syria, or staying in the UK and encouraging others to support the Islamic State. September 26. Police launched a probe into an alleged sexual grooming ring targeting teenagers in Glasgow. Girls as young as 14 are thought to have been targeted by men in the city center. A social worker told the Evening Times that the area is “rife” with child exploitation problems. One of the victims, a 17-year-old girl, is understood to have been taken to houses in Govanhill and Dennistoun for sex with multiple men. A relative said: “This really is just our worst nightmare, it’s this Rochdale and Rotherham-type stuff but it’s happening here in Glasgow in a big way. Nobody seems to be doing anything to stop it, all the girls have been made to believe these men are their boyfriends. It is white females they are hitting on, aged 14 to 19.” September 26. The Wolsey Infant and Junior Academy, a school in New Addington, announced that it would only serve halal meat in the canteen. The move sparked outrage among parents, who insisted that halal should be optional. September 26. The National Secular Society (NSS) reported that girls in dozens of schools in England were being made to wear the hijab or a headscarf as part of their official uniform policy. NSS research found that out of 142 Islamic schools that accepted girls, 59, or 42%, had uniform policies that suggested a headscarf or another form of hijab was compulsory. Ishtiaq Ahmed, spokesman for the Council for Mosques, said: “We have to accept that Britain, and a city like Bradford, is a multi-faith society, and faith is an important part of people’s identity. It is about tolerance and respect, and making efforts to understand people’s different way of life. People should have choices without the fear of being criticized.” September 27. A crowd of men wearing Islamic dress gathered outside a church in East London and repeatedly shouted “Allahu Akbar!” into a microphone while playing a recording of gunshot sounds at top volume on a loudspeaker. A video of the incident can be viewed here. A witness said: “I was alarmed, I did not know what was going on. When someone shouts Allahu Akbar while playing gunshot sounds on a speaker it is deliberately trying to alarm.” Another witness said: “I was alarmed at first but you come to expect things like that, it’s become common place in East London.” London police said they were unaware of the incident. September 28. Kamran Hussain, a 40-year-old imam at a mosque in Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison after being found guilty of two charges of supporting the Islamic State and six charges of encouraging terrorism. An undercover officer secretly recorded the Pakistan-born Hussain giving a series of sermons in which he told children as young as ten that martyrdom was better than academic success. “When you don’t fulfill the command of Allah, I’m coming to remove your head,” he said. September 28. Soruth Ali, a 42-year-old restaurant owner in Manchester, was sentenced to 14 months in prison for beating his 17-year-old daughter and her secret boyfriend. Bolton Crown Court heard how Ali, a devout Muslim, went into a rage and grabbed a hammer when he found the two in bed together. The daughter said she had been forced to live “two lives” at home and was forced to wear a headscarf in front of her father and that she wanted to “live her own life.” September 29. Henry Bolton, a former army officer, was elected to lead the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). Bolton, the party’s fourth leader in a year, beat the two favorites, Anne-Marie Walters, an anti-Sharia activist, and Peter Whittle, who has publicly spoken of his opposition to boycotts of Israel. Bolton pledged to take a softer line on Islam: “I absolutely abhor the rhetoric that says we are at war with Islam.” He also promised to review UKIP’s “integration agenda,” which calls for a ban on full-face veils in public. The policy changes were likely to reduce UKIP’s role as the primary opposition party resisting the Islamization of Britain. September 30. British universities hosted 110 events featuring extremist speakers in the last academic year, 2016/17, with the highest proportion taking place in London institutions, according to a report by the Henry Jackson Society. The extremist events were overwhelmingly organized by Islamic societies and groups; speakers included former Guantánamo Bay detainees and Islamists. OCTOBER 2017 October 8. The integration of Pakistani women living in Britain is “shockingly bad,” according to a Cabinet Office report. The findings of the UK’s first disparity audit was aimed at understanding how people from different backgrounds are treated regarding access to healthcare, education, employment and the criminal justice system. “Other communities have integrated very well, but the audit shows that Pakistani women who don’t speak English or go out to work are living in an entirely different society and are shockingly badly integrated,” a source close to the Cabinet Office told The Sunday Times. October 9. The trial began of ten Muslim men accused of operating a “cynical and predatory” child sex ring on a “massive” scale across Oxford. The six alleged victims were all from Oxford and aged between 13 and 15 at the time. Prosecutors said the men plied the girls with alcohol and drugs as part of what prosecutors called the “grooming process” and took part in “sex parties” at a number of addresses across Oxford, including at guest houses, in cars, and at local parks, involving groups of men. October 10. Hasan Alkhabbaz, a 22-year-old Syrian refugee, sexually assaulted six women in a subway in Paddington, London. The attacks occurred one month after he was granted asylum. Alkhabbaz, who admitted to six counts of sexual assault, said he was suffering from PTSD from the conflict in his homeland. October 11. David Wood, a former director-general of immigration enforcement, told the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee that there were “enormous difficulties” in removing illegal migrants from Britain: “There are probably over a million foreigners here illegally at the moment. There’s a large number, so no one could ever remove those really.” October 12. Sally Jones, a former punk rocker from Kent who became the leading female recruitment officer for the Islamic State, was killed in a U.S. airstrike. October 16. Abdel-Aziz Al-Shamary, a 21-year-old Kuwaiti who entered Britain illegally, was convicted of raping a stranger on a riverbank in Darlington. The attack occurred just weeks after he was granted legal status in the UK. October 17. The director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, revealed that MI5 and police had stopped seven attacks by Islamists in the past seven months. Twenty major acts were detected in the past four years and 379 suspects were arrested in the first six months of 2017. He said there currently were 500 live operations under way targeting 3,000 people with 20,000 more who have been on the counter-terrorism radar and others who are not even known to the law agencies. October 20. Naive jihadists who return to Britain after fighting for the Islamic State should be allowed to reintegrate rather than face prosecution, according to Max Hill, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. “The authorities have looked at them and looked at them hard and have decided that they do not justify prosecution, and really we should be looking towards reintegration and moving away from any notion that we are going to lose a generation due to this travel,” he said on BBC radio. October 22. Mubashir Jamil, a 22-year-old from Luton obsessed with martyrdom, was found guilty of trying to join the Islamic State. He was arrested after he told an undercover police officer that he wanted to wear a suicide vest and “press the button.” October 23. More than 100,000 Muslims registered on a website offering to help men find a “second wife.” Azad Chaiwala of Sunderland told BBC Inside Out: “The second wife website came about from my need, and thinking there’ll be other people in my situation. There are other deceiving ways of doing it — affairs, prostitution — those are not necessarily good for relationships. Here it’s more honorable.” In Britain, polygamous marriages are only recognized if they took place in countries where they are legal. British law does not, however, prevent unregistered religious ceremonies from taking place. October 26. The Lancashire County Council Cabinet banned unstunned halal meat in meals served at its 600 schools. It was the first council to do so. Council leader Geoff Driver said: “In my view, it is abhorrent to kill an animal without stunning it because of the distress it causes.” The Lancashire Council of Mosques (LCM) advised Muslim families to boycott all such meat because it was not Sharia-compliant. October 27. Steve Bailey, vicar of St Peter’s Church in Oadby, Leicestershire, banned the hymn “Onward Christian Soldiers” from a Remembrance Sunday service “in case it offends non-Christians.” October 31. A Muslim advocacy group that works closely with police forces, politicians and councils was accused of promoting Islamist views. Mend (Muslim Engagement and Development) was described as a group of “Islamists masquerading as civil libertarians” according to a report from the Henry Jackson Society. NOVEMBER 2017 November 2. The Home Office lost track of 56,000 foreign nationals, including convicted criminals and illegal immigrants, who were told they were liable to be deported from the country, and there is little evidence the government is trying to find them, according to reviews by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration. Around 80,000 foreign nationals are currently required to check in regularly at police stations or immigration centers while officials prepare for them to leave the country. But by the end of 2016, there were a total of 55,974 “declared absconders” who had failed to keep appointments and “whose whereabouts are unknown and all mandatory procedures to re-establish contact with the migrant have failed.” November 2. The British government and the UN are discriminating against Christians and other minorities in their refugee programs, according to Home Office statistics seen by Barnabas Fund, an aid agency that works for persecuted Christians. Barnabas Fund obtained figures proving that the UN has only recommended tiny token numbers of Syrian Christians, Yazidis and other minorities for resettlement in the UK. The overwhelming majority of refugees recommended by the UN have been Sunni Muslims who form the majority in Syria. But Christians, and other minorities have been repeatedly targeted for attack by Islamist groups such as IS. British officials tried to prevent the release of this information. November 3. Four members of a Kurdish sexual grooming gang in Newcastle were sentenced to 33 years in prison for trafficking girls as young as 13. The four men, all asylum seekers who entered Britain illegally and were allowed to stay, may face deportation. November 6. Farhana Ahmed, a 40-year-old mother of five from Wembley who urged others to launch jihadist attacks in Britain, was handed a two-year suspended sentence after a judge took pity on children. Ahmed shared a “prolific quantity” of Islamic State propaganda on a Facebook group whose aim was to support jihadists worldwide. Judge Christopher Moss said he was “moved” by a letter from her daughter and ruled that she could return to her children. November 7. Mohammed Sawalha, a trustee at Finsbury Park Mosque, one of London’s best-known mosques, is a senior member of Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, according to the Times of London. His role was revealed when it was announced that he was part of a Hamas delegation to Moscow in September which held a meeting with Mikhail Bogdanov, President Putin’s Middle East envoy, and a deputy foreign minister. November 7. Only 5% of honor crimes reported to police are referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, according to Sky News. Although more than 5,000 honor crimes were reported to police in 2016-17, only 256 such crimes referred to the CPS by the police in 2016-17, resulting in 122 convictions. This comes despite a large increase in the number of cases being detected and growing political awareness of the practice in recent years. November 8. A Muslim father who forced his 17-year-old daughter to drink bleach for being “too Westernized” was sentenced to a nine-month community order and 15 days of rehabilitation activities aimed at addressing his offending behavior. The girl asked magistrates to show leniency toward her father as she wished for them to mend their relationship. November 9. Students at the Kepier School in Sunderland were required to write a letter to their family about converting to Islam. Mark McLachlan refused to allow his 12-year-old stepdaughter to complete the assignment. He explained: “I know as part of the national curriculum they have to learn about all religions. I just don’t see why they should ask a child to write a letter addressed to their family about converting to another religion…. Like every parent, it is our decision on how we raise them and once they are old enough to make decision, then it is their choice.” November 13. Tesco, the supermarket giant, faced a social media backlash after it released a Christmas advertisement featuring a Muslim family but no Christians celebrating the holiday. Tesco said the adverts aim to promote diversity. November 17. The trial began of Akshar Ali for murdering Sinead Wooding, a 26-year-old mother or four from Leeds. She had converted to Islam and had married Ali in an Islamic ceremony in February 2015. Ali is accused of murdering Wooding in a knife and hammer attack after she continued to see a friend he had forbidden her to visit. November 17. Gangs in Birmingham were said to be tasering underage girls and gang-raping them, according to Councilor Des Flood. He said that Birmingham was facing a “tsunami of child sexual exploitation” and that schools and parents are being kept in dark about menace. November 19. Luqman Aslam, a 26-year-old delivery driver who deliberately drove his van into pedestrians in Leicester had his prison sentence reduced on appeal. He was sentenced to five years in prison at Leicester Crown Court in June after admitting to dangerous driving and attempting to inflict intentional grievous bodily harm. He appealed his sentence, saying it was too long, because at the time of the incident he had been fasting through Ramadan for 20 days. Judge Jeremy Carey cut Aslam’s sentence from five to four years. November 20. A Channel 4 survey revealed that almost two-thirds of Muslim women married in Britain are not in legally recognized marriages, as they have not had a civil ceremony alongside their Nikah religious ceremony. Many of these women are unaware that they therefore do not have the same rights and protections afforded to couples who are married in the eyes of the law. The survey also found that the vast majority of women questioned did not wish to be in a polygamous relationship, and more than a third of those who were in such a relationship had not agreed to it. November 22. Imran Qureshi, a 44-year-old Pakistani doctor who sexually assaulted a student nurse at a hospital in Manchester was allowed to keep his job after blaming the incident on “cultural norms.” Qureshi, a married father of two, admitted he made a mistake but said “cultural norms” were different in Britain compared to his native Pakistan and he failed to spot a “red light” warning him to make no advances towards the victim. November 27. A 17-year-old convert to Islam from South Wales was found guilty of planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack on a Justin Bieber concert in Cardiff. Jurors were told the boy had written a note with bullet points including “run down the non-believers with a car” and “strike the infidels who oppose Allah in the neck.” November 28. The General Secretary of the Union for Borders, Immigration & Customs, Lucy Moreton, said that Britain has “no way” of ever tracking down the hundreds of thousands illegal immigrants working on the black market. “If you are here illegally you can survive very well, you access medical services your child can go to school the chances of us catching you are very, very slim,” said Morten. “If you don’t break the law we are not going to get you as we don’t have the resources. We can’t catch you.” DECEMBER 2017 December 3. The All Saints Church in Kingston upon Thames held a joint birthday celebration for Jesus and Mohammed. The “Milad, Advent and Christmas Celebration” was aimed at “marking the birthday of Prophet Mohammed and looking forward to the birthday of Jesus.” The hour-long service included time for Islamic prayer and was followed by the cutting of a birthday cake. The prominent Christian blog “Archbishop Cranmer” rebuked the church for its lack of discernment: “Every time a church accords Mohammed the epithet ‘Prophet,’ they are rejecting the crucifixion, denying the resurrection of Christ, and refuting that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, for Mohammed denied all of these foundational tenets of the Christian faith.” December 5. Aliou Bah, a 28-yer-old Guinean migrant who served two sentences for sex crimes, was awarded £110,000 ($148,000) after a bureaucratic mix-up caused him to spend an extra 21 months in prison. Judge Madge ruled that Bah was entitled to justice. December 6. Naa’imur Zakariyah Rahman, a 20-year-old Bangladeshi-Briton, was charged with plotting to assassinate Prime Minister Theresa May. The alleged plan involved detonating a suicide bomb vest at the security gates outside 10 Downing Street, the official residence and the office of the British Prime Minister, before stabbing May. December 6. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Daily Mail that he was prepared to hunt down and use air strikes against the remaining 270 UK passport holders who have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with the Islamic State. “I do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country,” he said. “We should do everything we can do to destroy and eliminate that threat.” His comments sparked outrage from many on the political left. December 7. Husnain Rashid, a 31-year-old British citizen from Lancashire, was arrested for encouraging jihadists to attack Prince George at his primary school. He was also accused of calling for attacks on the Jewish community, and on British sports stadiums, in a series of encrypted messages. December 7. Abdourahman Amadeo, a 24-year-old Somali refugee, was sentencedto nine years in prison for his “animalistic” attempt to rape a drunken student. Amadeo, who was born in Somalia, fled to Italy as a refugee. He moved to Britain after obtaining Italian citizenship. December 14. The British government refused to say whether telling people about Christianity could be a hate crime. Lord Pearson of Rannoch said that when he raised a question on the issue in the House of Lords, the government failed to state clearly whether Christians can be prosecuted just for stating their beliefs. Speaking to Premier Christian Radio, Lord Pearson said the refusal to comment was “pretty unique” and “makes one very worried.” He also said there is a double standard in how hate crime laws are applied to Christianity and Islam: “You can say what you like about the Virgin Birth, the miracles and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, but as soon as you say, ‘come on, is Islam really the religion of peace that it claims to be,’ all hell breaks loose.” December 16. Mohamed Qoomaall, a 72-year-old Somalian refugee, was sentencedto 15 months in prison for pocketing £39,000 ($52,000) in welfare benefits after secretly returning to his homeland because he “missed the sunshine.” Qoomaall forged an immigration stamp on his British passport and had pension credit payments sent to him for two-and-a-half years as a friend enjoyed rent-free living in his council-funded home. December 19. Four men were arrested in raids in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire on suspicion of planning an imminent jihadist attack. December 20. Mohammed Awan, the 24-year-old brother of an Islamic State suicide bomber, was sentenced to ten years in prison for terror offenses. December 21. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims, a parliamentary group composed of members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, issued a report, “A Very Merry Muslim Christmas,” aimed at drawing attention to the “humanity” of Muslims during Christmas. December 22. Bradford Councilor Arshad Hussain warned that there were “many areas in this city” where people were afraid to go, depending on their ethnicity. He made the comments after “Asian” youths attacked three pubs in the city. “These were the only white businesses in the area,” he said. “No Asian businesses were attacked. They were targeted because they were white…. There are so many areas in this city where white people are scared to go into…. I think we are heading towards disaster.” December 22. Scotland’s International Development Minister, Alasdair Allan, pledged nearly £400,000 ($535,000) to fund 23 events for ethnic minorities during the winter months. He described them as “key dates in our national calendar” and said the “exciting and diverse” program would help Scots “celebrate everything great about our wonderful country during the winter months.” None of the events, however, had any connection to Christmas. December 23. St. Thomas Werneth, a church in Oldham, announced that it would remove its pews to make room for local Muslim community events. The church serves a “predominantly Muslim” area. Vicar Nick Andrewes said he wanted to “extend a welcome” to a wider flock. December 28. Metropolitan Police (Met Police) Service in London, Britain’s biggest force, has not improved its safeguarding of children at risk of sexual exploitation and rape since a report found systemic failings a year ago. Met Police improperly handled 90% of child protection cases, according to inspection results leaked to The Times. December 29. Vast areas of East, North and South London have been declared“no-go zones” by delivery drivers because of an epidemic of acid attacks. London has more acid attacks per capita than any other city in the world, according to Labour MP Stephen Timms. December 31. Security Minister Ben Wallace accused internet giants, including Facebook, Google and YouTube, of being “ruthless profiteers” that cost the government a fortune by failing to assist the security services in identifying jihadists and stamping out extremism online. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Wallace said the internet had become “an anarchic violence space” which was being leveraged by jihadists and rogue states to threaten the UK: “That’s what keeps me awake at night. We are more vulnerable than at any point in the last 100 years.” Please help our independent journalism by spreading this article!

One of the most striking interventions came from Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who spoke to peers about the Christian lessons to be learnt from atrocity. He said he was struck by three images from yesterday. The first is of a vehicle being driven across Westminster Bridge by someone who had a perverted, nihilistic, despairing view of objectives of what life is about, of what this society is about, that could only be fulfilled by death and destruction. The second is of that same person a few minutes later on a stretcher or on the ground being treated by the very people he had sought to kill. The third is of these two houses, where profound disagreement, bitter disagreement, angry disagreement, is dealt with not with violence, not with despair, not with cruelty, but with discussion, with reason, and with calmness. It seems to me that those three pictures point us to deep values within our own society, deeper even than the ones that have been mentioned in the prime minister’s statement and other statements, which is the sense that comes from a narrative within our society for almost 2,000 years that speaks of, at this time of year as we look forward to Holy Week and Easter, of a God who stands with the suffering and brings justice, and whose resurrection has given to believer and unbeliever the sense that, where we do what is right, where we behave properly, where that generosity and extraordinary sense of duty that leads people to treat a terrorist is shown, where that bravery of someone like PC Keith Palmer is demonstrated, that there is a victory for what is right and good over what is evil, despairing and bad. That was shown yesterday, hat is shown not just in our expression of values but in our practices which define those values and that is the mood that we must show in the future. Attacker 'not among' top 3,000 on MI5 list Ewen MacAskill It has emerged that the attacker – who has still not been named – was not among the 3,000 Britons on MI5’s list of individuals whom they regard as potentially capable of committing an act of domestic terrorism. May told the Commons he had been on the radar of the security services as a “peripheral figure” years ago. About 3,000 Britons, mainly Islamists, are monitored because police suspect they might be capable of an attack. Of them, 500 are the subject of active investigations and only a limited number of those become the targets of physical surveillance. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has been speaking to US news show Morning Joe. He says the attacker was known to police and MI5, as May said earlier this morning. I think what I can say about the individual concerned is that his values, his idea of the world will not prevail. He launched an attack at the heart of our democracy as has happened many times in the last decades. The values of that Palace of Westminster will continue to triumph and whatever he thought he was doing, he will not succeed. Islamic State claims responsibility for Westminster attack Amaq, the news agency used by Isis to broadcast propaganda, says that the group is responsible for the attack. It calls the attacker “a soldier of Islamic State.” This is a claim by them, which obviously cannot be verified at this stage. The wording of the Isis statement suggests he was inspired, rather than directed by them but we have no confirmation on either front. Often what is significant in the Commons is what is not said. As the Guardian’s home affairs editor Alan Travis says, it was striking that this atrocity has not led to calls for a new anti-terror crackdown. The one exception to this was Theresa Villiers suggesting that all police officers guarding “sensitive sites” in London should be routinely armed. (See 11.57am.) But the fact that this was a relatively modest proposal, which Theresa May was happy to sidestep, proves Alan’s point; there is no appetite in the Commons for a fresh wave of authoritarianism. The Metropolitan police has acted fast to step up security at London’s airports, reports the Guardian’s Helena Smith. Within hours of the attack, extra patrols of police armed with automatic weapons were in place at Heathrow’s terminals. By 3.10PM yesterday – exactly 30 minutes after the as-yet-unidentified assailant ploughed the rented SUV into people on Westminster bridge – six heavily armed police were standing outside one entrance to the departures lounge of Terminal Two. In an effort to reassure the public the Met police had announced that extra patrols, armed and unarmed, would be in place, “particularly in crowded places and iconic locations”. Despite the heightened police presence however, there were no other evident restrictions for travellers flying out of Heathrow last night or this morning. Several MPs have called for a permanent memorial to PC Keith Palmer for making “the ultimate sacrifice for our democracy.” Conservative MP Nigel Evans said Palmer was “one of us”. The tribute to Keith and the police are that we are here today and our proceedings are going on. We have the arch that’s been spoken about before, which is a lasting memorial to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our democracy. I do hope that at an appropriate time, with discussion with the family, that we too may be able to look at a lasting memorial to Keith in order that each and every one of us know that there are people putting their lives on the line for our democracy today. Fellow Tory MP Michael Fabricant also called for a memorial in Palmer’s honour and Palmer’s friend, James Cleverly, asked for him to be given a posthumous award for bravery. The prime minister said she was sure the issue would be considered by the parliamentary authorities. In Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon has just started first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament. She says many MSPs have friends and even family members working in Westminster. They were shocked by what happened, she says. She says her thoughts and prayers are with the family of PC Keith Palmer. And she praises the bravery of all those who serve in the police. She says she was updated by Police Scotland yesterday, and again this morning. There is no evidence of a threat to Scotland. But, as a precautionary measure, policing has been increased, she says. She says the only people to blame for acts of terrorism are those who perpetrate them. She says she wants to echo the words of Theresa May: terrorists seek to undermine our values, but they will not succeed, she says. Tobias Ellwood, the junior foreign office minister who went to the aid of PC Keith Palmer, has been listening to tributes in the House. His face was full of emotion. The MP, who performed CPR on the dying officer, did not speak but his bravery was mentioned by many MPs from both parties.

With heads bowed, MPs from different parties stood side-by-side along the green benches to pay their respects ahead of digital, culture, media and sport questions. Five people died, including Pc Keith Palmer, and dozens more were injured when 52-year-old Khalid Masood launched a car and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and the Palace of Westminster before he was shot dead. Tearful members of the public watch on and one grief-stricken man covers his face with his hands The Prime Minister, who was whisked out of Parliament on the day of the attack, pictured today Victims of the Westminster terror attack have been remembered at a special vigil. The ceremony in Westminster Hall was held to mark the first anniversary of the attack and was attended by politicians, senior police officers and people involved in the incident. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, told the gathering in Westminster Hall: 'A year ago, darkness struck across Westminster Bridge and in this palace. It spread across the bridge like a snake, driving to left and right, killing and harming' Khalid Masood (right) launched his sickening attack on March 22, 2017, mowing down and killing four pedestrians before stabbing unarmed Pc Palmer (left) as he stood guard Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said: 'I'm sure the whole House will want to associate ourselves to mark the memory of those who passed away a year ago, as we have just noted in the one minute's silence, and to thank once more the emergency services who keep us safe and, especially on this day, those who put others' safety ahead of their own. 'We remember those who have lost their lives defending democracy. They will not be forgotten.' Labour's Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) said: 'While thinking of the victims of the terrorist outrage last year, I think all of us on the benches hope that the families of those people who were tragically killed have been looked after.' RELATED ARTICLES Share this article Share Sports minister Tracey Crouch, in her reply, said: 'Pc Keith Palmer was an avid Charlton Athletic fan and it was only right that the club actually respected him by turning his usual red seat in The Valley white with his number written on it, so his memory will always live on at the football club.' MP Tobias Ellwood broke down on television today as he recalled the moment he comforted his young son after he had tried in vain to save the life of Pc Palmer in the Palace of Westminster. Mr Ellwood was in Parliament when terrorist Khalid Masood launched his sickening attack, mowing down and killing four pedestrians before stabbing unarmed Pc Palmer as he stood guard. In an emotionally-charged interview one year on, the politician fought back tears as he recounted the conversation he had with his son in the wake of the atrocity. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood pictured at the scene as he desperately tried to save PC Palmer MPs observed a minute's silence in memory of those killed in the 2017 Westminster terror attack in the House of Commons this morning MEMORIALS TO HONOUR OFFICERS AND TERROR VICTIMS Pc Palmer's name will be one of 1,400 inscribed on a new UK Police Memorial commemorating officers killed on duty. Another 4,000 of those who died on duty will be remembered inside the memorial in Staffordshire. Plans have also been revealed for a memorial for victims and survivors of the four terrorist atrocities that took place in the city last year - at Westminster Bridge, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green. Well-wishers will be able to leave messages in a digital book of hope at City Hall from today. Members of the public will be able to send messages to the installation - which will remain open until June - using #LondonUnited on social media, and their words will be projected on to a map of the capital. The phrase #LondonUnited will be projected on to the Houses of Parliament, London Bridge, Finsbury Park Mosque and Parsons Green Tube station on the anniversaries of the attacks. Five innocent people were killed in Masood's rampage - 48-year-old Pc Palmer, US tourist Kurt Cochran, Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, 31, and Britons Aysha Frade, 44, and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes, who were mown down on the bridge. Mr Ellwood told the BBC: 'The other reflection and vivid image I have is returning home after what had happened and finding my son on the top of the stairs. 'He was in tears and he was just on his own. I sat next to him and he just asked 'why'? 'He couldn't understand why I had stepped forward, why someone had been killed, why someone was yielding a knife in a place that he had visited so many times. 'And all I could offer him was that there are some bad people in the world but there are good people and it is the good people who win.' Pc Palmer's friend has also paid tribute, saying he was 'a proud and courageous police officer who did his job and never wanted any fuss.' In a statement released through Scotland Yard, Pc Shaun Cartwright said: 'Keith loved being a police officer, he just wanted to help people and do his best. 'Keith was always happy, always the first to help anyone out, first in to work and the last one out. 'He was a proud and courageous police officer who did his job and never wanted any fuss or to be the centre of attention. Keith was a true and loyal friend, utterly reliable. 'Most of all I will remember him as a family man who idolised his wife, daughter and his family; they're the important ones that I think about a year on from the Westminster attack.' Mr Ellwood, a former Army officer whose brother Jonathan was killed in the 2002 Bali terror atrocity, has paid tribute to the police for their work in a country 'that seems to be getting more dangerous and more volatile'. The Defence Minister said the threats faced by the UK were not going away and involved not just terrorism but 'resurgent nations challenging the world order'. He also recounted the moment of the attack on ITV's Lorraine. This harrowing picture of Mr Ellwood as he and members of the emergency services desperately tried to save Pc Palmer's life became one of the defining images of the attack Pc Palmer (pictured posing for a photo at the Palace of Westminster), was 'a proud and courageous police officer who did his job and never wanted any fuss', his friend has said MET POLICE PAY TRIBUTE TO VICTIMS It read: '22nd March 2017 is a day that remains vivid in many of our minds. Our thoughts are also with all those who died that day or whose lives were turned upside down.' 'Aysha Frade; Keith Palmer; Kurt Cochran; Leslie Rhodes and Andreea Cristea. All of whom remain much loved and missed by their families and loved ones. Today it is only natural for many of us to stop and pause and remember in our own way. 'The horror of that day was marked by acts of astonishing compassion and bravery as those who responded rushed to help the injured; to comfort those in distress and to bring calm to chaos.' 'I know that today we will remember, those taken from us, those who were injured and all those that day has had a lasting impact on. We owe it to them to carry on with courage, professionalism and determination; to do our very best to prevent future attacks and keep people safe.' Mr Ellwood told the host today: 'Huge respect to all police officers, because they don't know how their day is going to unfold and they just go to work and get on with it. 'I saw PC Keith Palmer lying there and could see he had lost a lot of blood and that's when I stepped forward to try and help. 'I just recall how professional the police were in moving into a situation where they were taking control and command of everything up to the silence of what is usually a busy place, until there was no-one around except for police. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with PC Palmer's friends and family. He did what he loved doing. He applied to stay on and do this work and loved every minute of it. 'We know these police officers well. They are part of the fabric of the community, so it is one of ours - it felt. 'But there was this feeling that we will not be cowed by this. We will not let this affect us. Life goes on. The next day, Parliament did sit - we weren't going to stop. 'Likewise, these terrorist activities try to rip us apart but they do they do the opposite. It makes us more determined that we are going to stand up to this.' He added: 'When we go back to when I first became aware of terrorism was the loss of my brother in 2002 (in the Bali bombings). 'Fifteen years ago and today these attacks are still taking place. We are going through a very dangerous and volatile period. 'We are at a pivotal moment and ask 'do we just look after ourselves?' Or do we see where things are going wrong. Al Shabab or Boko Haram or Al Qaeda - all these flourish where there isn't any governance. 'Not only that, the religion of Islam itself is being used - a peaceful religion - these terrorists have scant understanding of it and think they are going to paradise for what they do and that's the work that we need to embark on. 'There is a determination that we will not be defeated. And we walk by that location every day - it's right by the main entrance so all MPs are very conscious. Let's not forget Jo Cox was killed by an extremist too and her plaque is inside the chamber itself which we all look at. 'We live in a very dangerous world and it's up to us to work out the strategy we're going to hold in order to stand up to our values which we've spent decades, millennia, developing. 'That's what we need to remember. We will not be defeated by these terrorist. We will move forward and be positive - and that's the message that I told my son.'

{"originalUrl":"http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/23/police-expect-to-make-more-arrests-in-connection-with-westminster-attack","text":"The authorities say the attacker drove his car into pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer. He was later shot dead. London police say more arrests are expected in connection with the terror attack. The Metropolitan Police Service's Mark Rowley says police had searched addresses in London, Birmingham and other parts of the country in their investigation. He said there was a mix of nationalities among the dead but gave no details. The victims were a policeman who was stabbed and two members of the public, a woman in her mid-40s and a man in his mid-50s. The fourth casualty was the assailant. Police believe they know the identity of the attacker but have not named him. The attack on Wednesday started when the assailant sped across Westminster Bridge in a car, ramming pedestrians along the way. He then ran towards parliament and stabbed the policeman before he was shot. Three French high-school students aged 15 or 16, who were on a school trip to London with fellow students from Brittany, were among the injured. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was expected to arrive in London to visit them at hospital, French media reported. Westminster Bridge remained cordoned off with a strong police presence. The nearby Westminster underground train station, normally a busy hub in the morning rush hour, was not accessible from street level as it was within the cordon. WATCH: Witnesses describe 'horrendous' London attack Prime Minister Theresa May has called the policeman who died in the line of duty a hero. In a televised address, May told the nation that Britain’s resolve will never waiver in the face of terrorism. She also thanked Britain’s friends around the world for standing with her country. Additional police officers have been deployed to step up patrols on the streets of London. Parliament was due to convene later in what May said late on Wednesday was a sign that the attack would not disrupt British democracy or normal life in the capital.","title":"Police make eighth arrest

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/23/westminster-attack-police-arrest-seven-people-in-raids-at-six-addresses","text":"Emergency services outside the Palace of Westminster treat the attacker, who has been named as Khalid Masood. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Detectives are piecing together the history of the Westminster terrorist Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old ex-convict who used a string of aliases and reportedly converted to Islam only in later life. Masood was described by police as a criminal with a 20-year record of offending, who had once been investigated for extremism but was assessed as low risk. Reports have emerged that his birthname was Adrian Russell Ajao. He was earlier named as Adrian Elms. London attack: police investigate terrorist Khalid Masood as death toll rises – live Read more As police search for any evidence of a wider conspiracy, eight people remain in custody after properties across the UK were raided, while a picture emerged of the killer’s apparently nomadic lifestyle. The death toll from his assault on the capital rose to four on Thursday night when a 75-year-old man, named as Leslie Rhodes from Streatham, south London, had his life support withdrawn at King’s College hospital. The police said on Friday morning that two people remained in hospital in critical condition, with one of these considered to have “life-threatening” injuries, after Masood drove his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before running into the parliamentary estate armed with two knives and fatally stabbing PC Keith Palmer before himself being shot dead. Fifty people have been confirmed as injured, with 31 requiring hospital treatment. Two police officers remained in hospital with significant injuries. The vigil in Trafalgar Square, central London, was held to honour the dead and injured, Sadiq Khan said, but also “to send a clear, clear, message – Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism”. Westminster vigil: we will never be cowed by terrorism, says mayor Read more Earlier, prime minister Theresa May told MPs Masood had been previously known to MI5: “Some years ago, he was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture.” Amber Rudd, the home secretary, later added that Masood had spent time in jail, but not for terrorist offences, while the Metropolitan police said “Masood” was in all likelihood not his birth name. The names of two people who died after Masood mowed them down on Westminster Bridge also emerged. They were Kurt Cochran, 54, a US tourist from Utah celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary, and British-born Aysha Frade, 43, who worked at sixth-form college and had been walking over the bridge to pick up her daughters from school. In the frenzied attack on Wednesday, Masood also stabbed to death PC Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old husband and father. The prime minister said Palmer was “every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten”, while a crowdfunding appeal for his family has raised more than £364,000. The attack was stopped when armed officers assigned to protect the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, shot Masood, who is believed to have been intent on entering parliament. Palmer died at New Palace Yard on the edge of the parliamentary estate, near Parliament Square, raising questions about security for legislators. The original incident, in which Masood drove a Hyundai Tucson 4x4 into crowds at one of London’s busiest tourist spots, left 40 people injured, 29 of whom were taken to hospital. In an emergency statement to the Commons, May said people from around the world had been caught up in the attack. “In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks,” she said. London terror attack: what we know so far Read more She also sounded a note of defiance, telling MPs: “Today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism.” May’s spokesman said she had received phone calls from world leaders including Angela Merkel, François Hollande and Donald Trump, offering their condolences and support, and had herself signed a book of condolence in parliament. She later visited the injured in hospital. Police said Masood had been inspired by Islamic State. But he hid his extremism from his neighbours, coming across as a keen gardener and family man. The domestic intelligence service will face questions over why Masood dropped off the radar after being investigated in relation to concerns over violent extremism. An MI5 team has been set up to see what lessons can be learned from the case and to look at the decision to not put him under surveillance. The police and security services monitor an estimated 3,000 Britons, mainly Islamists, regarded as capable of terrorism, but it emerged he was not on this list. Isis claimed responsibilty for the attack, although the claim could not be verified. Amaq, the news agency it uses to broadcast propaganda, issued a statement describing the attacker as a soldier of Islamic State, without naming him. Police revealed that Masood, born in Kent on Christmas Day 1964, had a string of criminal convictions. In a statement, the Met said: “He was known to police and has a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. “His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife.” The investigation is being led by SO15, Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. Police staged raids across Birmingham, including Masood’s recent home in Winson Green, and at properties in London, Carmarthenshire and Brighton. Neighbour Iwona Romek said Masood was a keen gardener, who lived in the modern mews house with his wife and young child. Romek, 45, said her experience of him was of a “nice man”. She said the family had moved out suddenly in December 2016 and added: “I used to see him outside doing his garden. Never any trouble.” It is believed that Masood rented the Hyundai car that he turned into a weapon of terror from the depot of a car hire firm, Enterprise, in Spring Hill, Birmingham. Police still believe the attack was carried out by Masood alone, but are looking into whether others helped him. The eight arrests were all on suspicion of acts of preparation of a terrorist act, a key indication that police are investigating the possibility of a wider conspiracy. A 39-year-old woman was arrested in east London, while two women aged 26 and 21 were detained in Birmingham. Five men aged 23, 26, 27, 28 and 58 were arrested in Birmingham. PC Palmer’s family released a statement paying tribute to the police officer, who had a five-year-old daughter. They said: “Dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will be deeply missed. We love him so much.” As a mark of respect, Palmer’s shoulder number – 4157U – is to be retired and not reissued to any other officer, Scotland Yard said. The Met has put extra officers on the streets and has extended the shifts they work from eight to 12 hours, until further notice. Forces outside London are also increasing their presence on the streets, to provide reassurance and to deter not only any further Islamist attacks but hate crimes against Muslims. The Independent Police Complaints Commission began an investigation into the shooting of the suspect, which is mandated by law.","title":"Police unravel multiple aliases of Westminster terrorist

{"originalUrl":"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/783925/Westminster-attack-PC-Keith-Palmer-honoured-police-memorial","text":"HUNDREDS of people lined up to pay tribute to the Westminster terror attack victims as it emerged that hero police officer Keith Palmer will be honoured at the police memorial grounds. PC Palmer, unarmed but wearing a protective vest, was guarding the Carriage Gates on Wednesday when he was stabbed by Khalid Masood. Masood had stormed the grounds of Parliament after ploughing a grey Hyundai Tucson into dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced last night that PC Palmer, 48, will be commemorated at the UK Police Memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire, which provides “a lasting tribute to the sacrifices that all too many police officers have made”. Related articles Ms Rudd added that the father-of-two had “touched the lives of millions of people in this country and around the world”. She said: “[PC Palmer] gave his life, in the line of duty, in order to keep others safe. “So much has been said and written in tribute to PC Palmer – a husband and father who went to work on Wednesday morning and will never go home. “It is impossible to fully describe the debt of gratitude we owe to him. I want to express my heartfelt condolences to his family, his colleagues and his friends at this incredibly difficult time. I know there is a profound sense of loss, but his actions will never be forgotten.” The police officer acted very bravely and he has the admiration of us all Veteran Bob Filby Ms Rudd also gave her best wishes to the two officers who remain in hospital after being injured in the attack as she praised the police and emergency services’ “remarkable” response to the atrocity. PC Palmer’s sacrifice has reached the hearts of people across the nation. A Just Giving account set up to help his family had raised £700,000 last night, almost tripling its original target of £250,000. A highly decorated old soldier has joined calls for murdered PC Keith Palmer to be given a posthumous medal in recognition of his bravery. Bob Filby, 93, who was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery during heavy fighting in the Second World War, said PC Palmer should be posthumously given the George Cross, a gallantry medal. Bob said: “The police officer acted very bravely and he has the admiration of us all. “I fully support the calls for him to be honoured.” Acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley also paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: “Keith, you put yourself in harm’s way to protect others in the best traditions of the police force.” Yesterday hundreds of people descended on Parliament to pay their respects to the officer as well as the three other victims of Masood. Thousands of bouquets lined the streets where the horror unfolded, while many adorned the railings surrounding the Palace of Westminster. Human rights lawyer Mohamed al Shekhili, 51, said: “I feel so sorry for this policeman who died without reason. He is a hero. “These terrorists are not Christian, Muslim or Jewish – they kill without reason – and I feel ashamed of them. “I came here as a refugee fleeing the war in Iraq and now our blood is united and we must stand together. This beautiful country and it’s beautiful people gave me everything. PA The unarmed 48-year-old was guarding Westminster when he was stabbed by Khalid Masood “I came here today to stand with the police and thank them. They protect our life, they stand here to give us security.” Paul Monk, 55, from Wandsworth, south-west London, said: “We must not let these people win. “Looking around, there is such a sense of unity. The atmosphere is very emotional, it’s very touching to see people come together in the face of something like this. To lose your life just doing your job, in the line of duty, is awful. I came to lay flowers and handed them to a policewoman and offered my condolences.” Colin Pearce, 65, travelled from Slough, Berkshire with his wife to pay tribute. He said: “You don’t realise how close you come to these things, you think because it’s Britain it’s safe but there is a sense of shame that this can happen here. GETTY Memebrs of the public have called the officer to be given a posthumous medal of bravery “There are people from all over the world here today paying tribute. It’s tragic to think that a policeman who stands between us and crime can lose his life. We care about life, and we are fighting people who don’t.” Pat Burke, 77, had travelled to the capital with her husband Len, 81 and grandson Liam, 10. She said: “As soon as we arrived the emotion hit me. I just felt like I needed to come. “People lost their lives because of this person. I’m ashamed that someone who called themselves British could do this sort of thing. Being here really brings home the horror of what happened. “But standing here there is also a sense of unity.

In the most detailed breakdown yet of events on Westminster Bridge and parliament on Wednesday, police said that the entire attack, in which Masood had killed four people before being shot dead, lasted a mere 82 seconds. After four days of intensive inquiries across England and Wales, involving hundreds of officers, the Metropolitan police said they had so far failed to establish the reason for the attack. It is continuing to look at whether Masood was prompted by online propaganda by Islamic State, which has claimed he was a “soldier”, or whether he had some other sense of grievance. But deputy assistant Metropolitan police commissioner Neil Basu said: “We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned.” The security services do not like the term “lone wolf”, feeling that it glamorises an attacker, and instead prefer “lone actor”. Although 11 people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack, nine have since been released, with no further action to be taken. A 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham remained in custody on Saturday while a 32-year-old woman from Manchester has been released on bail. Police are investigating media reports that Masood checked his encrypted messaging service WhatsApp – or even sent a message – just before the attack, which hinted at others being involved. The police statement confirming that he was a lone actor does not appear to support suggestions that he had been in touch with an accomplice. Basu, who is the senior national coordinator for UK counter-terrorism policing, said: “Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts to bring reassurance to Londoners, and to provide answers and closure for the families of those killed and the victims and survivors of this atrocity. “We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this. That understanding may have died with him.” The police, having reconstructed the attack, said it had begun at 14:40:08 when Masood’s hire car mounted the pavement on Westminster Bridge, weaving along the footpath and road until 14:40:38 when he crashed into the perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster. He left the car at 14:40:51 and was shot by a police firearms officer, part of the close protection team of the defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, in the palace courtyard at 14:41:30. At 14:40:59, the first 999 call was made to the Met reporting the incident. Basu said the investigation was continuing and appealed for anyone who had spoken to Masood in recent months, especially in the days leading up to the attack, to contact the police. They are still trying to establish whether he had been “inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice.” He praised the way London and communities throughout the rest of the country had come together and that there had been no backlash. “The way that communities in London, and throughout the UK, have come together in the wake of this attack shows that we will not give in to those who seek to breed discord and fear,” Basu said. “Terrorists have tried to tear this city apart before and they have never succeeded. A very small minority of people have tried to use this as an opportunity to stir up hate, but once again we stand together in calm defiance. We will not allow them to divide us.” As the police and security services piece together Masood’s background, the Saudi Arabian government confirmed that he had worked in the country as an English teacher between 2005 and 2009.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.itv.com/news/border/2017-03-23/cumbrian-shopkeeper-caught-up-in-westminster-terror-alert/","text":"After receiving the award she was enjoying lunch with her husband and daughter and the Copeland MP Trudy Harrison in the Terrace Restaurant when they noticed the blue lights on Westminster Bridge through the glass doors. Within moments security staff and armed police officers came into the restaurant ordering them to run to the central lobby. The family had to remain there with hundreds of others for around five hours while Parliament was in lockdown. Daphne runs the Braithwaite Village Shop which she managed to reopen just six months after being flooded out during Storm Desmond. The shop has been flooded a number of times. Newly elected Copeland MP Trudy Harrison told ITV Border of her sadness for the families of the injured and killed. We looked through the glass door and could see blue lights on the bridge. Within seconds the police rushed through and began urging us to run to the central lobby. My immediate thought was that it was a bomb scare but by the urgent nature of the police, we knew it was very serious. My overwhelming thought is for the families who'll never be the same again and grateful that I'm able to return home to my family today. The Prime Minister's statement last night said that we should not be defeated and work is continuing as normal, but it doesn't stop that feeling of loss and grief for the families

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/parliament-attack-police-officer-four-dead-westminster?CMP=share_btn_tw","text":"Police and security services are investigating the background of the man who killed four people and injured dozens in a terrorist rampage at Westminster as security was visibly stepped up in the capital on Thursday. While the Houses of Parliament prepared to sit as normal, officers were attempting to establish the motivation and any terrorist links of the attacker – who was known to counter-terrorism officials – and look into his connections and associates. A raid was carried out by armed police overnight at a flat above a shop in Birmingham just west of the city centre, with surrounding roads closed for several hours. BBC Newsnight reported late on Wednesday that the vehicle used in the attack – a Hyundai i40 – could have been rented in Birmingham. A direct link between the two events is yet to be established, however, West Midlands police referred enquiries to the Metropolitan police in London, which said it would not be commenting for “operational reasons”. In London, extra officers – armed and unarmed – have been ordered onto the streets and Parliament Square remains closed as the capital wakes up. Westminster Bridge remains closed and the tube station is open but for interchange only. Up to 40 people were injured when a lone terrorist attacked Westminster, stabbing a police officer to death as he tried to storm parliament, and killing three members of the public as he careered through the heart of the capital in a 4x4 vehicle. The attacker was among those killed in the first mass-casualty terrorist attack on Britain in over a decade. The Commons and Lords were locked down for several hours because of fears of further attacks. PC Keith Palmer. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images The policeman who died was named as Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Service. He was married with children and had been a police officer for 15 years. The Met’s head of counter-terrorism, Mark Rowley, said the motivation of the attacker was assumed to be “Islamist related” and he had tried to enter parliament but had been stopped. Rowley said Palmer “was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen”. People fled for their lives as a Hyundai 4x4 driven by the terrorist at about 2.40pm indiscriminately ran into people on Westminster Bridge. The use of the vehicle to attack civilians was a direct copy of an Islamic State tactic used previously with murderous effect in Nice and Berlin. The vehicle then careered off the road on to pavement a few metres away from Big Ben and the attacker tried to storm parliament armed with a knife. Play Video 0:22 People flee parliament as gunshots ring out – video Moments later, a police officer who was guarding parliament was fatally stabbed. The attacker, dressed in black, was shot by another armed officer and died of his injuries. The Guardian understands the initial working theories of the police investigation are the attacker was inspired by Isis and was most likely a “lone actor”. The attacker was already known to counter-terrorism officials. Rowley said investigators were trying to establish the attacker’s associates and his preparations for the attack. Theresa May was rushed out of parliament as the attack unfolded and later chaired an emergency meeting of the government’s crisis committee, Cobra. Shortly before 9pm on Wednesday, her voice cracking with emotion, the prime minister confirmed that what she called the “sick and depraved” attack had been carried out by a single assailant. She also praised the bravery of the police and other emergency services, who “ran towards the danger, even as they encouraged others to move the other way”. The prime minister added that Britain’s threat level would remain at severe, where it has been for some time; but she struck a defiant tone, insisting it would be business as usual for MPs and Londoners on Thursday. “The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech,” she said. Rowley said: “This is a day that we had planned for – that we all hoped would never happen – but sadly it is now a reality.” On Wednesday night, a massive investigation involving Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command and domestic security service MI5 was under way. Police chiefs have ordered extra officers, armed and unarmed, on to the streets of the capital. Keeping the national terrorism threat level at severe means an attack is feared to be highly likely but there is no intelligence a specific plot is imminent. Parliament was filled with MPs at the time – a couple of hours after prime minister’s question time. They were alerted to the incident by the sound of shots being fired. Within minutes, David Lidington, the leader of the Commons, told stunned MPs: “What I am able to say to the house is there has been a serious incident within the estate. It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police.” A visual guide to the Westminster attack Read more Witnesses described how a scene of horror suddenly unfolded at what is one of the UK’s busiest tourist spots. Rob Lyon, 34, from Rugby, was walking along Westminster Bridge with a colleague when he saw a 4x4 vehicle travelling at high speed, hitting pedestrians. He said: “I heard a wheel definitely hit a kerb, quite a loud crunch noise, I looked up and saw a car clearly hitting people as it came towards me. A colleague I was with, James, I heard him sort of shout. I instinctively jumped off the pavement. I could see people being hit. And then the car just carried on up the bridge and I just looked around and was really in shock.” Radosław Sikorski, a former Polish foreign minister, saw at least five people lying on the ground after being “mown down” by a car. “I heard what I thought was just a collision and then I looked through the window of the taxi and saw someone down, obviously in great distress,” he said. Play Video 0:35 Members of the public helping the injured on Westminster Bridge – video Pictures emerged after the incident showing people lying injured on Westminster Bridge, some of them bleeding seriously. A woman was pulled alive from the Thames with serious injuries after having fallen into the water during the attack. The car then sped towards the Palace of Westminster, and came to a halt on the pavement, up against railings to the north of New Palace Yard, the green space adjacent to Big Ben, opposite an entrance to Westminster tube station. A man with a knife was then seen running through the gates of the Palace of Westminster, across New Palace Yard and stabbing a police officer. The attacker continued his rampage, targeting a second officer, according to witnesses. But he was shot by police as he approached, knife in hand. Witness Rick Longley said he saw the car crash into the railings and a man leaping out. He said: “We were just walking up to the station and there was a loud bang and a guy, someone, crashed a car and took some pedestrians out. “They were just laying there and then the whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben. A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman.” UK terror attacks since 11 September 2001 The Bournemouth MP, a former soldier, was pictured with blood on his forehead, helping the police officer in Parliament Square. Ellwood’s brother Jonathan was killed in the 2002 Bali terror attack. Two people could be seen lying within New Palace Yard, immediately outside Westminster Hall. The sitting in the House of Commons was suspended while police officers sealed off the area. Parliamentary staff were told to stay in their offices. Minutes after the incident, an air ambulance landed in Parliament Square, as sirens were heard outside, but the officer could not be saved. Up to 1,000 people were evacuated at various locations, including Westminster Abbey. It took several hours for parliament to be evacuated. The Westminster attack is a tragedy, but it’s not a threat to democracy | Simon Jenkins Read more Hospitals in London were put on alert and of the 20 injured, eight were taken to the major trauma centre at King’s College hospital, with two people in critical condition and six stable. Those at King’s were six men and two women. Two casualties were treated at St Thomas’ hospital, immediately opposite the Houses of Parliament, a man and a woman, both of whom were stable. The ambulance service said eight of those injured were treated at the scene. In a statement the Muslim Council of Britain said: “We condemn this attack and while it is still too early to speculate on the motives, our thoughts and prayers are for the victims and those affected. We pay tribute, too, to the police and emergency services who handled this with bravery. The Palace of Westminster is the centre of our democracy and we must all ensure that it continues to serve our country and its people with safety and security.” London mayor Sadiq Khan said in a video message: “London is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. We always have, and we always will. Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.” The headline of this article was changed on 23 March 2017 after the death toll from the terrorist attack was revised downwards from five to four.","title":"Westminster attack: police hunt for clues after four dead in 'sick and depraved' incident | UK news | The

The scheme chosen for the site is by the architect Sir David Adjaye. Westminster council has begun the planning process and permission for the £50 million monument and learning centre is expected later this year, with work finished by 2021. Residents and environmentalists have warned that Victoria Tower Gardens, one of the smaller royal parks, will be all but obliterated by the project, which features 23 bronze blades. The staircases in between the blades represent the 22 countries where the Nazis destroyed Jewish communities.

Photograph: Handout/Reuters The Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, who battled to save the life of a police officer in the Westminster terror attack, and the security minister, Ben Wallace, have been honoured for their roles in responding to the atrocity. Downing Street announced that the Queen was “pleased” to approve the appointment of Ellwood and Wallace to the privy council. Security chief told MPs they were safe in parliament before attack Read more Ellwood, ran towards gunfire to help PC Keith Palmer, who was stabbed in the attack, while Wallace helped coordinate the government’s response. The pair will now be entitled to be referred to as “right honourable” and receive top-secret national security briefings as members of the privy council. It is mainly composed of senior politicians, but includes some bishops and judges, and has advised the monarch since the Norman era. Theresa May praised the “extraordinary” bravery of Ellwood in her House of Commons statement on Thursday. The former soldier was pictured with blood on his face and clothes as he tried to give Palmer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and stem the blood amid the carnage in New Palace Yard on Wednesday, but the officer died from his injuries. The Bournemouth East MP’s bravery was praised by many colleagues, who had gathered in the Commons chamber to listen and respond to the prime minister’s statement on the terror attack. But Ellwood, whose brother Jonathan was killed in the 2002 Bali terrorist bombing, shook his head as a fellow MP called for him to be recognised in the honours list.","title":"Tobias Ellwood appointed

{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/uk/435922-terror-motive-suspect-westminster/?utm_source=browser&utm_medium=aplication_chrome&utm_campaign=chrome","text":"London Houses of Parliament attack: What do we know so far? Questions remain over the Houses of Parliament attack in London, which left three people injured and a suspect in custody. As Britain remains on high alert for terrorism, here’s what is known about Tuesday’s incident so far. The attack At around 7:40am on Tuesday, a silver Ford Fiesta rammed into a number of pedestrians and cyclists before crashing into steel barriers outside the Houses of Parliament. According to witnesses, the car was soon surrounded by armed police. Footage posted on social media showed the suspect being taken from the vehicle before being handcuffed. “The car drove at speed and towards the barriers. I was walking on the other side [of the road],” said eyewitness Ewalina Ochab. “I heard some noise and someone screamed. “I turned around and I saw a silver car driving very fast close to the railings, maybe even on the pavement. The person driving did not go out of the vehicle.” Three people were treated at the scene, two of whom were then taken to hospital with non-serious injuries. The nearby St. Thomas’ Hospital confirmed that it was treating one patient whose injuries were not life-threatening. The motive In light of several previous attacks – on Westminster Bridge in March 2017 – and a number of suspected attacks that transpired to be accidents, speculation was rife as to whether the incident was an act of terrorism. Scotland Yard’s head of counter-terrorism, Neil Basu, stated: “Given that this appears to be a deliberate attack – the method and this being an iconic site – we are treating it as a terrorist incident.” At the time of publishing, no terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for the attack. Previous attacks on London were quickly claimed by Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). Speculation over the motive is being fueled by questions that remain about the attacker. The suspect Police confirmed that they arrested a man in his late 20s. After armed police surrounded his vehicle, the suspect was removed from the scene and taken to a police station in south London. Officers proceeded to search his vehicle, confirming in a later statement that he had acted alone and that there were no weapons found in the car.

In this case, it was a frequently used gate in New Palace Yard that was left unlocked. Known as Carriage Gates, the entrance is generally monitored by police officers. Could the weakness have led to the attack? Could the attack have been prevented (or minimised) if the gate had been bolted shut? Planned ‘complete security overhaul’ Finger pointing in the wake of such incidents may seem counterproductive, but there is value in assessing any lessons learned. Reports of a planned \"complete security overhaul\" in the wake of the London attack make sense. In any case, the existing security procedures likely minimised the impact of the attack, which could have been even worse and more deadly. As it was, a terrorist drove a vehicle down a Westminster Bridge pavement crowded with pedestrians and into a perimeter fence. Getting out of the car, the man stabbed the first officer he encountered after entering the unlocked gate; the officer later died of his wounds. Five people were killed, including the attacker, who was shot to death. Twenty-nine were wounded, including seven reported in critical condition. The low-tech, rudimentary nature of the attack is another reminder of the changing face of terrorism The changing face of terrorism The low-tech, rudimentary nature of the attack is another reminder of the changing face of terrorism. Previous emphasis on elaborate, carefully planned attacks seems to have given way to a more barebones approach to creating terror: Simply drive a vehicle into a crowd of people. Planning more elaborate attacks tends to involve more people and could leave an electronic trail to enable security and anti-terrorism agencies to uncover plots before they can be carried out. In contrast, driving a vehicle into a crowd is easier, might involve fewer perpetrators and likely needs little advanced planning. Successful detection of more elaborate plots has led terrorism groups to resort to the simpler route. Several terrorist-related web sites have reportedly encouraged followers to use vehicles as weapons of terrorism. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the London attack. The plan was simple and almost undetectable until it happened. Vehicle barriers Vehicle barriers can help prevent such attacks, whether concrete or moveable bollards, steel fencing, crash-rated portable barriers, or other measures. They are currently used all over the world, including government buildings and high-profile locales where pedestrians might gather. The Elysee Palace is fortified by high walls and steel fencesand is restricted from trafficand protected by armed patrols For example, Berlin's Reichstag has fences in front of the building's main entrance and is surrounded by low concrete blocks, although it is largely accessible to the public with no fences on the other sides. The European Parliament headquarters in Brussels is protected by low steel bollards on the roadside, and the French National Assembly's front gates are protected by concrete bollards to prevent high-speed ramming. France's Elysee Palace is fortified by high walls and steel fences, and is restricted from traffic and protected by armed patrols. Vehicle traffic around the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., is restricted; steel railings several feet high, also encircled by steel bollards and chains, protect the perimeter of the White House. Such venues will be the subject of new security evaluations, even as Britons look for answers about how the latest attack could have been prevented. The challenge is that any weak spot could be the point of entry for the next tragedy.

In case you missed it Newly modernised halls with lots of daylight will house hundreds of exhibitions and conference events at the upcoming Security Essen 2018 at Messe Essen, Germany. A new layout and hall numbering system will be unfamiliar to past attendees but promises to simplify the experience as it brings together attendees and exhibitors. European physical security market Security Essen is an international trade fair, but the emphasis is more on German, Austrian and Swiss companies. In all, Security Essen will feature 1,000 exhibitors from 40 nations. The trade fair has more of a continental European “flavour” compared to IFSEC, which focuses more on the U.K market. At the last Security Essen in 2016, organisers reported about 40,000 visitors including conference participants, VIP guests, members of various delegations and journalists. Security Essen 2018 has more of a continental European “flavour” compared to IFSEC, which focuses more on the U.K market “This year, we have sharpened the profile of Security Essen,” says Oliver P. Kuhrt, CEO of Messe Essen, a trade fair, congress and event organiser with its own exhibition grounds. “The trade fair has become considerably more digital, more modern and more interactive. Due to the optimised hall layout, we are offering our exhibitors and visitors the best possible experience with short paths and direct communication.” Newly modernised Messe Essen The newly modernised site of Security Essen will encompass eight halls, newly renumbered and with the subject areas reorganised, too. Visitors will find Services in Hall 1; Access, Mechanatronics, Mechanics and Systems in Halls 2 and 3 and the Galeria; Perimeter Protection in Hall 3; Video in Halls 5 and 7; and Fire, Intrusion and Systems in Halls 6 and 7. A helpful smart phone app, downloadable free from the Google Play Store (Android) or the Apple App Store (iOS), will be available two weeks before the event and include a show floor plan; the exhibitor list with booth numbers and contact information; and an overview of the supporting programme. A separate hall – Hall 8 – will house new Cyber Security and Economic Security categories. Cyber Security Conference At the new Cyber Security Conference, located prominently at the new East Entrance, experts will share their knowledge about the more pressing challenges and potential of cybersecurity. The programme opens and closes on 25 and 28 September with the main topic “Opportunities and Risks of Cyber Security”. On 26 September, discussions and lectures will centre on “Entry, Admission, Access: Identification Options”.A helpful smart phone app, downloadable free will be available two weeks before the event and include a show floor plan On 27 September, the topic will be smart homes and focus on “Connected Building, Security in the Buildings of the Future”. Speakers will include the president of Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security, who will address cybersecurity as a challenge for politics, business and society. The fair organises the conference in cooperation with the BHE Federal Association of Security Technology and the technical support of the Federal Office for Information Security. In Hall 8, a new Public Security Forum will enable visitors to experience digital security technologies for public spaces from the areas of sensors/IoT, cyber security and surveillance. The products and solutions will be installed in four different building scenarios (town hall, school, hospital and library) and it will be possible to test them extensively. The forum, including lectures and discussions, will target municipal decision makers and planners of public spaces. Comprehensive programme A Security Expert Forum in Hall 2 will present a continuous programme with more than 90 presentations during the period of the fair. Visitors will obtain information and solution ideas about all six subject areas covered at the fair, and the programme will begin with a keynote lecture each morning and finish with a live demonstration in the evening. On the first day of the fair (25 September), Security Essen’s Career Forum will introduce retrainees, students, trainees and graduates to companies from the security industry. Targeted and professional communication will be established between companies and job applicants to facilitate making contacts, developing networks, and filling actual vacancies. Thursday (27 September) will be observed as Fire Prevention Day, and a Drone Course will be provided each day in Hall 7. One day admission to Security Essen is €41; a four-day ticket is €105. Advance sale tickets are discounted. There are many aspects to consider when developing a retail security strategy, including loss prevention, physical security, asset protection, risk management, and IT. All these areas could be the responsibility of just a few people working to secure a handful of stores or each of these areas could be entirely separate departments, as is often the case for major retailers with locations throughout the country. Regardless of the size of the retailer, there are many different technologies that can be used within a retail store to improve security and loss prevention, yet none should be used in a silo. There are tremendous benefits to integrating security technologies and communications systems together, including enhancing overall safety and security, reducing shrink, and improving operations. There are many different technologies that can be used within a retail store to improve security and loss prevention As the existing security infrastructure is evaluated and plans for the future are developed, the team responsible should consider some of the following questions. Are there areas of the store that require greater security? Are there notifications or other technologies that could improve the efficiency of personnel and the safety of shoppers? Are there other departments within the organisation that could benefit from the data gathered by the security technology? Understanding current pain points within the stores and how integrated security solutions can address these is the key to implementing the best solution. Here are a few “hot spots” within a typical retail store that easily demonstrate the power of integrated solutions. Point of sale terminals Whether it’s loss through sweet hearting or other fraud, point of sale terminals present a significant shrink risk for retailers. Integrated systems enhance security at these locations. Video recording of HD or megapixel cameras integrated with point of sale data makes it easy to locate video associated with transactions and exception reporting. This allows for visual verification of each transaction when needed.There are tremendous benefits to integrating security technologies and communications systems together Other risks like robbery not only result in loss, but also impact the safety of employees and shoppers alike. Panic buttons or bill trap sensors connected to the intrusion detection system ensure silent alarms are issued when employees are at risk. When the intrusion detection system is integrated with the video system, pressing a panic button or pulling the bill from the sensor can automatically trigger a video snapshot to be sent to the monitoring station to provide verification of the alarm and more information for law enforcement when they are dispatched. Adding audio integration to the intrusion system can also result in a message sent to the store security personnel’s two-way radio when a panic button is pushed, or a bill trap sensor is activated. If no security guard is onsite, video monitoring services can allow the monitoring centre to intervene through audio, alerting the perpetrator that his or her actions are being monitored and that the authorities have been contacted. This may cause the offender to flee the area, helping to mitigate the safety risk as well as the potential for loss. Panic buttons or bill trap sensors connected to the intrusion detection system ensure silent alarms are issued when employees are at risk High value displays Protect high-value or frequently-stolen items such as electronics, using video analytics integrated with audio communication Protect high-value or frequently-stolen items such as electronics, using video analytics integrated with audio communications. For example, a person standing at a display for longer than a pre-defined time or touching items on display can trigger a video snapshot to be sent to the store manager and an audio message to play through a nearby loudspeaker, such as: “Thank you for your interest in our smartphone selection; an associate will be there soon to assist you.” This not only alerts potential offenders that their actions are being watched, it also serves to improve customer service for legitimate shoppers – as a retail floor associate is notified that a customer may need assistance. Cash office An access control reader at the door to the cash office restricts access to only authorised individuals. Integrating video can automatically capture an image of the person requesting access for verifying an employee’s identification prior to granting access or for retrospective analysis in the event of a theft. Exit doors If an employee props open a back door – either for easy re-entry after a break or to allow access to another person with intentions of theft – integration of the intrusion detection system to the video and audio system can significantly reduce risk of loss. For example, the intrusion detection system can monitor doors for abnormal conditions, even when the system is disarmed.Loss can also occur when a cooler or freezer malfunctions or when the door is accidentally left open A door left open for longer than a pre-defined time can cause an alarm on the intrusion panel, which can trigger a nearby camera to send a snapshot of the open door to the store manager and trigger the public address system to play a pre-recorded message through a nearby speaker. This prompts the employee to close the door, reducing risk of theft. Coolers and freezers Loss isn’t just about theft. Loss can also occur when a cooler or freezer malfunctions or when the door of one of these units is accidentally left open. The same concept for monitoring exit doors can also apply to doors for coolers and freezers to prevent spoilage. A cooler or freezer door monitored by the intrusion detection system can trigger an alert or chime to play in the area to remind an employee to close the door or to alert the store manager to the issue. While providing surveillance of the cash register area, the camera's video analytics can be used to trigger an alert in case the queue exceeds the pre-defined threshold Serving a dual purpose Retailers can use the metadata from the cameras to gather business statistics like counts of people entering the store While the technology solutions described above positively impact loss prevention in a retail store, they can also extend beyond security to improve health and safety and enhance customer service as well as customer engagement and sales. For example, while securing a store’s main entrance with IP cameras featuring on-board video analytics, retailers can use the metadata from the cameras to gather business statistics like counts of people entering the store. This data can help them understand peak days and times when making decisions about staffing. Or while providing surveillance of the cash register area, the camera's video analytics can also be used to trigger an alert in case the number of people in a queue exceeds the pre-defined threshold. At this point, the same public address system and loudspeakers used to play background music to enhance the shopping experience could be activated to broadcast a message to request another cash register to be opened, improving store operations. For security and loss prevention purposes, video analytics can also be used to ensure that no one enters or leaves the retail shop using the emergency exit. To address health and safety issues, these same cameras can also trigger an alarm if that emergency exit is blocked by an object – improving the safety of customers and employees. When systems are used to deliver data for purposes beyond security, other departments may be willing to contribute toward the cost Metadata generated by the cameras can also be used to gather information that when processed with sophisticated algorithms in the cloud can show trajectories of the paths that shoppers take as they travel throughout a store as well as heat maps indicating where they walk, stop and dwell – all while protecting the privacy of individual shoppers. This information can be used by merchandisers to evaluate the success of displays and store layouts, which directly impacts customer engagement and sales. When systems are used for and deliver data for purposes beyond security, other departments may be willing to contribute toward the cost of the system. This provides an added benefit by relieving some of the cost burden from security or other operational budgets. Product selection Integration is becoming easier using standards and expanding industry partnerships. However, in some cases, choosing systems from a single vendor that are designed to work together can help to speed and simplify installation, while also reducing system costs for both the integrator and the user. Regardless of the products chosen, it will be important for a retailer with many locations to have consistency in the type of equipment installed at each site. This makes support easier and enables a more uniform response to incidents that happen at various stores. As many retailers already understand, there is no silver bullet to reducing loss. However, a combination of the right technologies working together to prevent shrink and improve investigative capabilities can result in smarter and more effective loss prevention. GSX 2018 is both a new event for the security industry and the continuation of a 63-year tradition. Global Security Exchange (GSX) is the new branding for ASIS International’s annual seminar and exhibits, which have been held since 1955. In recent years, the ASIS event has joined forces with other organisations to expand its scope and to appeal to a broader audience. Partners include ISSA (Information Systems Security Association) and Infragard, a public-private partnership between U.S. businesses and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The expansion is continuing this year with the addition of 30 supporting organisations representing industry verticals and reflecting ASIS’s intent to unite the full spectrum of security. Improving the state of cyber security Held September 23-27 at the Las Vegas convention Center, GSX 2018 seeks to attract more than 20,000 operational and cyber security professionals and 550 exhibitors. The Cyber Security Summit will co-locate with GSX, offering cyber security programming at a time when it is needed the most Other elements will further expand the 2018 event’s scope. The Cyber Security Summit will co-locate with GSX, offering cyber security programming at a time when it is needed the most. Top government, industry and academic thought leaders will engage in a dialogue to improve the state of cyber security. The 2018 Security Cares Program will address school violence prevention and response in a free education program. Topics will include pre-violence indicators, target hardening, and best practices to involve the entire community of school administrators, law enforcement, security professionals and mental health providers. Experts to deliver keynote speeches Keynote speakers including CNN host Fareed Zakaria will bestow celebrity appeal. Air Force Major General Bradley D. Spacy will share details about the new AFWERX innovation and tech hub in Las Vegas and how the U.S. Air Force is collaborating with the private sector to bring new security product ideas to market. Spacy’s keynote on Sept. 26 will kick off Military and Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Also, K.T. McFarland, former Trump Administration Deputy National Security Advisor, will share an insider’s perspective on critical foreign policy and defence industries. Attendees to ASIS International’s annual gathering typically list networking and education as big benefits of the event. Historically, the trade show aspect has existed separately from the educational program, and foot traffic to the exhibits has sometimes suffered from the competition. Beginning last year, and continuing in 2018, ASIS International has pursued innovative approaches to integrate the trade show more closely into the overall attendee experience. “The integration of programming and exhibits is truly seamless,” says one observer of the new approach. Held Sept. 23-27 at the Las Vegas convention Center, GSX 2018 seeks to attract more than 20,000 operational and cyber security professionals and 550 exhibitors X Learning Theatres GSX has sought to transform the exhibit hall into a ‘learning lab environment’ that features thousands of security products, technologies and service solutions (provided by the exhibitors), in addition to ‘immersive learning opportunities to connect the current and emerging threat landscape with solutions available in the marketplace’. There are several ‘X Learning Theatres’, including one (‘X-Stage’) focussed on leading-edge technologies such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, AI, drones, and robotics. There is also an ‘Xcelerated Exchange Stage’ to facilitate discussions among security practitioners and solution providers. The ‘Xperience Stage’ showcases case studies and best practices. Also attracting more attendees to the Exhibit Hall will be ‘Career HQ’, a free career fair and enhanced career centre. ‘D3 Xperience’ (Drones, Droids Defence) will focus on unmanned systems with education and demos. The ‘Innovative Product Awards (IPAs) Showcase’ will highlight winners of an awards program. Focussing on security practices GSX is not as much about sales leads as about making connections and contributing to a larger conversation about how to protect people, facilities and assets ASIS International (now GSX 2018) is often compared to ISC West, the U.S. industry’s largest show held in Las Vegas in the spring. GSX 2018 this year may face even more scrutiny based on the changes, rebranding, and location (also in Las Vegas). However, GSX is a completely different show than ISC West, which focuses on the business of security. In contrast, GSX is much more about the practice of security than business. The international network of ASIS International members attend the yearly conference to make new connections, to learn and to benefit from the experiences of other security professionals around the world. The successful trade show exhibitors are the ones that approach the show with that understanding. GSX is not as much about sales leads as about making connections and contributing to a larger conversation about how to protect people, facilities and assets. ASIS International deserves credit for their efforts to integrate the trade show element into the larger goal of the event. Hopefully their new approach will enhance the overall experience for both attendees and exhibitors – and help to make the world a safer place as a consequence.","title":"London terror attack prompts

{"originalUrl":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4396832/Islamist-head-Muslim-pressure-group.html","text":"Share this article Share 2k shares His Facebook post came after it emerged that Masood had used the messaging service two minutes before he ploughed into at least 50 people with a 4X4 before stabbing PC Palmer to death. Mr Ali has previously lost a libel action against several newspapers that said he was 'a hardline Islamic extremist who supports the killing of British and American soldiers in Iraq by fellow Muslims as justified'. Mr Ali said that Khalid Masood should be considered a 'lone wolf' not a terrorist Mr Ali's lawyers at Carter-Ruck said his comments on the Westminster Bridge attack were 'referring to terrorism in the sense of organised acts co-ordinated by terrorist groups'. His legal teams also said Mr Ali considered it 'a barbarous and cruel act of murder for which there was no possible justification or mitigation'. In 2009 it emerged that Mr Ali, then an IT worker and president of the Civil Service Islamic Society, was suspended on full pay for six months following comments on his blog. In one post Mr Ali quoted an interview with an Islamic militant who said: 'If I saw an American or British man wearing a soldier's uniform inside Iraq I would kill him because that is my obligation. 'If I found the same soldier in Jordan I wouldn't touch him. In Iraq he is a fighter and an occupier, here he is not. I respect this as the main instruction in my religion for jihad.' Sir Gus O'Donnell, then Britain's most senior civil servant and patron of the Civil Service Islamic Society, ordered that Mr Ali be suspended while an investigation was carried out. Six months later the investigation finished and Mr Ali returned to his job. His group Mend works with politicians on all sides, the police and the CPS to enhance the engagement of British Muslims in UK life. Mend relies on donations for funding and online it quotes the Koran saying: 'And whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah's Cause), He will replace it' Today The Times made a number of claims about the organisation. It said that Labour's Yasmin Qureshi, the shadow justice minister, accepted a £5,000 donation from Mend's founder Sufyan Ismail - but failed to name him as the donor. The newspaper also claims that The Charity Commission will speak to three charities over their funding of Mend speaking events. At one an Islamic speaker considered to have extreme views told the audience that killing comes easily to 'the children of Israel'. The Times also claims that Mend targeted the NSPCC and used social media to send them angry messages because the children's charity set up a hotline for families to report children if they feared they were being radicalised. Mend relies on donations for funding and online it quotes the Koran saying: 'And whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah's Cause), He will replace it'.","title":"Islamist becomes head of a Muslim

{"originalUrl":"http://www.businessinsider.de/westminster-terror-attack-suspect-2017-3","text":"He was born in Kent and had previously been investigated by MI5 over concerns relating to violent extremism. It was not known he was planning Wednesday's attack, but police said in a statement he has a range of previous convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm (GBH), possession of offensive weapons, and public order offences. He has not been convicted for any terrorism offences. Earlier on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Masood, who was the unnamed at the time, had a history of extremism, and was known to police and intelligence officials. In a speech in Parliament on Thursday, May acknowledged that the \"whole country\" would want to know the identity of the attacker but said he would not be named while investigations continue. In an update earlier Thursday morning, Metropolitan Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley urged the media to avoid naming the man while the investigation was at a \"sensitive\" stage. Channel 4 names the wrong man The attacker was briefly identified by Channel 4 News on Wednesday evening as a prominent British-born Islamist extremist, but the broadcaster later reversed its report after other journalists disputed it on Twitter. BBC Pakistan correspondent Secunder Kermani said a \"reliable source\" told him the man Channel 4 named was in jail. ABC journalist Rym Momtaz echoed this account, saying she had spoken with the person's solicitor on Wednesday. Channel 4 News later acknowledged the error made in its 7 p.m. bulletin. Editor Ben de Pear said award-winning reporter Simon Israel named the wrong man, but he did not apologise for the mistake. A repeat of Channel 4 News on Channel 4+1 at 8 p.m. was taken off air for about 40 minutes so the mistake did not air twice. A Press Association photographer took images of the suspect in the attack receiving medical assistance outside the Palace of Westminster. Sprawled metres away from the slain police officer, the man died from his gunshot wounds. Moments earlier, a police officer could be seen standing over the man with his firearm. He appeared to be standing on a knife, possibly the one used in the attack.","title":"Who is Westminster terror attack suspect?

{"originalUrl":"http://london-informer.com/300844/fnn-deadly-terror-attack-in-london-people-struck-on-westminster-bridge-full-coverage-london-videos/","text":"FNN: Deadly TERROR Attack in London – People Struck on Westminster Bridge – FULL COVERAGE – London Videos Brought to you by Desert Diamond: http://ddcaz.com LONDON (AP) — A knife-wielding man went on a deadly rampage in the heart of Britain’s seat of power Wednesday, plowing a car into pedestrians on London’s Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer to death inside the gates of Parliament. Four people were killed, including the assailant, and about 20 others were injured in what Prime Minister Theresa May condemned as a “sick and depraved terrorist attack.” Lawmakers, lords, staff and visitors were locked down after the man was shot by police within the perimeter of Parliament, just yards (meters) from entrances to the building itself and in the shadow of the iconic Big Ben clock tower. He died, as did two pedestrians on the bridge, and the police officer. A doctor who treated the wounded from the bridge said some had “catastrophic” injuries. Three police officers, several French teenagers on a school trip and two Romanian tourists were among the casualties. Police said they were treating the attack as terrorism. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Mark Rowley said police believed there was only one attacker, “but it would be foolish to be overconfident early on.” The threat level for international terrorism in the U.K. was already listed at severe, meaning an attack was “highly likely.” Speaking outside 10 Downing St. after chairing a meeting of government’s emergency committee, COBRA, May said that level would not change. She said attempts to defeat British values of democracy and freedom through terrorism would fail. “Tomorrow morning, Parliament will meet as normal,” she said. Londoners and visitors “will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart.” U.S. President Donald Trump was among world leaders offering condolences, and in Paris, the lights of the Eiffel Tower were to be dimmed in solidarity with London. London has been a target for terrorism many times over past decades. Just this weekend, hundreds of armed police took part in an exercise simulating a “marauding” terrorist attack on the River Thames. Wednesday was the anniversary of suicide bombings in the Brussels airport and subway that killed 32 people last year, and the latest events echoed recent vehicle attacks in Berlin and Nice, France. In the House of Commons, legislators were holding a series of votes on pensions when deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced that the sitting was being suspended and told lawmakers not to leave. Parliament was locked down for several hours, and the adjoining Westminster subway station was shuttered. Conservative lawmaker Tobias Ellwood, whose brother was killed in the Bali terror attack in 2002, performed first aid on the wounded police officer, who later died. About 10 yards away lay the assailant. “I tried to stem the flow of blood and give mouth to mouth while waiting for the medics to arrive but I think he had lost too much blood,” Ellwood said. “He had multiple wounds, under the arm and in the back.” The attack began early Wednesday afternoon as a driver in a gray SUV slammed into pedestrians on the bridge linking Parliament to the south bank of the River Thames. Former Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski was in a car crossing the bridge when he heard “something like a car hitting metal sheet” and then saw people lying on the pavement. “I saw one person who gave no signs of life. One man was bleeding from his head. I saw five people who were at least seriously injured,” Sikorski told Poland’s TVN24. Ambulances arrived within minutes to treat people who lay scattered along the length of the bridge. One bloodied woman lay surrounded by a scattering of postcards. Police said one injured woman was pulled from the river. The car crashed into railings on the north side of the bridge, less than 200 yards (meters) from the entrance to Parliament. As people scattered in panic, witnesses saw a man holding a knife run toward the building. “The whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben,” said witness Rick Longley. “A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman. I have never seen anything like that. I just can’t believe what I just saw.” The attacker managed to get past a gate into Parliament’s fenced-in New Palace Yard, a cobbled courtyard in the shadow of the Big Ben clock tower. Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts said a man in black attacked the police officer before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the building. “As this attacker was running towards the entrance two plain-clothed guys with guns shouted at him what sounded like a warning, he ignored it and they shot two or three times and he fell,” Letts told the BBC. & what did the British Parliament \"officials\" say???????? \"TRUMP DOES NOT DESERVE A CEREMONIAL STATE VISIT\" because TRUMP IS A RACIST BASED ON THE TRAVEL VETTING…… well there u go!!!!!!At least OUR PRESIDENT is

{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/uk/382425-terrorism-whatsapp-encryption-westminster/#.WNkNBm0rUqk.twitter","text":"Major General Jonathan Straw says ministers are trying to use the terrorist incident last Wednesday to push for handing security services more powers, despite the weak case for it. His comments come after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it is “completely unacceptable” that authorities cannot look at the encrypted social media messages of attacker Khalid Masood on platforms such as WhatsApp. Masood was on the chat platform just minutes before his fatal assault on the streets surrounding Parliament. Straw says unlocking such data will also allow other parties such as criminals and foreign spies to access it. He told the BBC legislating for such a move would not necessarily make it easier to stop future terrorist attacks. He says if the government does push through laws to decode messages, terrorists would quickly use other secure methods of communicating. “There’s a debate in Parliament about the whole snooper’s charter [Investigatory Powers Act 2016] and the rights of the state and I think what they are trying to do is use this moment to nudge the debate more in their line.” “The power will mutate and move on. We are aiming at a very fluid environment here. We are in real trouble if we apply blunt weapons to this, absolutist solutions,” he added. The European Union’s presidency has also expressed concern about such a move. According to the Associated Press, Maltese Interior Minister Carmelo Abela said people’s privacy must be protected. “There is a fine line here. We need to of course protect the privacy of the people, but we also have to protect the security of the people.” Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Rudd said there must be “no place for terrorists to hide.” “We need to make sure organizations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don’t provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other. “In this situation we need to make sure our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.” She hinted that the government could be prepared to create new laws on the matter, telling Sky News later: “I’m calling time on terrorists using social media as their platform … I’m giving them more than a ticking off.”","title":"UK govt ‘using’ Westminster terrorist attack to snatch more

Why do that if his heart is not still beating? Performing CPR on a gunshot victim? Really? The easiest way to understand islam is to understand muhammad. Muhammad is the perfect example of a muslim, this is understood. Muhammad was a warlord, murderer, rapist, pedophile, salve trader, wife beater and jihadist. He spread islam through violence. This is fact, this is understood. Islam is an evil, satanic cult that promotes violence, hatred and bigotry. Islam has no place in western civilization. Muslim population should stay at no more than 3%, anything more than that will create issue, At least when they're 3% of the total population they demand equality after surpassing 3% they demand your death.You can't reason with them because most of them don't have IQ more than 85, and they think they deserve some kind of recognition, they want to be great but they're lacking competence, and they think Islam ideology is the only thing they have to thrive on, much like North Koreans grabs nuke tight, athletes who addictive to steroids.We used to have lots of Muslim problems, they're incompatible to my civilization, then the cultural revolution happens, red guards tearing down mosques, force Muslims raising pigs in mosque, force them eats porks because if they don't it's seem as anti revolution.

Turnbull said: As prime minister Theresa May said earlier this morning, the values of the British parliament command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. And so they do because they are our values too. We stand, all of us, with the UK. Comforted that we share those values. They’re ours. Freedom of speech, democracy, the rule of law. We will never give in to terror. He said of British MP Tobias Ellwood, who assisted attempts to resuscitate the police officer, PC Keith Palmer, who was fatally stabbed: This act of heroism is just one of the extraordinary stories that are emerging from this tragedy. Shorten paid tribute to Palmer: The murder of the Metropolitan police officer reminds us of the risks our security agencies take on our behalf to keep us safe. And on behalf of all honourable members I want to acknowledge and thank our Australian federal police and the parliamentary security officers for whom this news must strike a particular chord. Thursday’s Guardian editorial calls for solidarity in the wake of the terror attack on Westminster and pays tribute to the officers who intervened: The security forces and police have planned for what they call a “marauding attack” for years. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace. There will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates, but for now, there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job. The Guardian view on the Westminster attack: solidarity against terror | Editorial Donald Trump Jr is facing a backlash for criticising London mayor Sadiq Khan with a scornful tweet sent hours after an attack at the Houses of Parliament left five dead, including a police officer and the attacker. The US president’s eldest son tweeted a link to a September 2016 story in the Independent, which quoted Khan saying terror attacks were “part and parcel of living in a big city … I want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked.” “You have to be kidding me?!” Trump Jr tweeted, quoting only the headline: “Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan”. Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO Donald Trump Jr called 'a disgrace' for tweet goading London mayor The Hyundai driven by the attacker raced over Westminster Bridge, mounting the pavement and mowing down pedestrians. Three members of the public are now believed to have been killed here, and up to 40 injured. The car then veered across a cycle lane and smashed into parliament’s perimeter wall. A man jumped out of the car and rushed through the gates into New Palace Yard where he fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer. The attacker was then shot several times by armed officers. What happened in Westminster was witnessed by a number of parliamentary journalists, whose offices immediately overlook New Palace Yard, the cobbled square through which many MPs and peers drive each day to access parliament’s underground carpark: Quentin Letts, the Daily Mail’s parliamentary sketchwriter, has a desk near the window overlooking the yard; on hearing a loud crash and some screams, he told BBC news, he and his colleagues rushed to see what was happening. “Then I saw a thick-set man dressed in black clothes, he looked I would say about 40 years old, I don’t think he had much hair, running … through the gates. He seemed to have something in his hand, a stick or something like that.” A policeman who tried to challenge the man had fallen over, Letts said, “and the attacker was hitting him, possibly striking him or knifing him”. The weapon was a knife, and the stab wounds inflicted would prove fatal. The victim was later named as PC Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old officer with 15 years’ service who was a husband and father. The attacker then ran towards the entrance of the parliament building that is used by MPs each day. “He got about 15 yards or so when he was shot by two plain-clothes men who had come out of the building, having been summoned by the uniformed police,” said Letts. Before shooting, they shouted something at the man, “and he appeared to ignore them and still ran towards them, and they shot him about three times”. 'All hell was let loose': witnesses on the Westminster attack Australian PM pays tribute to 'mother of parliaments' The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has extended Australia’s “heartfelt sympathy and resolute solidarity” to the people of the UK. The attack in the British parliament is an attack on parliaments, freedom and democracy everywhere. Westminster is rightly known as the mother of parliaments. Almost every element of our parliamentary tradition, here in Australia, is modelled on that of the houses of parliament in London. We send our condolences, especially to the families of the victims, those injured, including a police officer murdered by the terrorist. Turnbull said he had received briefings on the attack from Australia’s counter-terrorism coordinator, Tony Sheehan, and the high commissioner in London, Alexander Downer. He had also spoken to the Australian federal police commissioner and the director general of security, Duncan Lewis. Turnbull added that there would be an increased police presence in Canberra’s Parliament House on Thursday. Australians should be reassured that our agencies are today, as every day, working relentlessly to keep Australians safe. We are very alert to the vulnerabilities of places of mass gathering and the risk of lone attackers, like the terrorist in London. Keeping Australians safe is our highest priority. It is the first duty of my government. The South Korean embassy in London has sent officials to two London hospitals where five South Korean victims are being treated, media in Seoul have reported. All of the injured South Koreans are believed to be aged in their 50s or 60s. A South Korean foreign ministry official said the embassy had entered emergency mode since the terrorist attack, according to KBS World Radio. The report added that South Korean nationals travelling in the UK had been sent text messages alerting them about possible risks. “Three of the four women and a man sustained relatively light injuries but the other woman sustained an injury to her head and underwent surgery at a nearby hospital,” KBS World Radio reported, saying the tourists were hurt when they were caught in a stampede of people fleeing the attack on Westminster Bridge. The Seoul Shinmun, a daily broadsheet, reported that the 67-year-old female victim, who has been identified only as Park, was not directly injured by the vehicle driven deliberately by the attacker into pedestrians on the bridge, but fell to the floor. She is undergoing surgery at St Mary’s hospital, Paddington. Park arrived in London a day earlier together with her husband and was scheduled to leave for Paris later on Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported, citing officials. Of the four other South Koreans injured in the incident, two required surgery due to a clavicle fracture or arm fracture, and the remaining two patients complained of pain, according to the Seoul Shinmum. Edge Hill University, in Ormskirk, Lancashire, has confirmed that some of its students were injured on Westminster Bridge. In a statement, the university said the group – believed to have been 13 students and their lecturer – had been visiting the capital on a field trip. Two students were taken to hospital. Owen Lambert, 18, from Morecambe, Lancashire, needed stitches to a head wound, and Travis Frain from Darwen, who, according to a tweet from a local journalist, had a cracked rib plus hand and arm injuries. His mother, Angela Frain, confirmed he was in hospital: I have spoken to him at 3.20pm and I know he’s OK. He’s at the hospital with a police officer. The police officer just said he was in good spirits. Two other students are believed to have minor injuries but were not hospitalised. All others on the trip were safe and accounted for, the university said. Dr John Cater, vice-chancellor of Edge Hill, told BBC North West Tonight: They had just actually finished their session, were leaving the parliament building and in the Westminster Bridge area where we understand … they were involved in the incident. We understand that two students have been taken to hospital but as walking wounded – one with a head wound and one with a wrist injury. There are two other students who have minor injuries who are with police and acting as witnesses. The good news is that the other nine students are now back in a hostel receiving support and will return to the north-west tomorrow. The details are invariably hazy … Our assumption is that they were either knocked over by other people or struck by the vehicle. Obviously all of them will be somewhat traumatised by what they have seen as well.","title":"Westminster attack: PC Keith Palmer named as police officer killed – live updates | Politics | The

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/23/facebook-safety-check-westminster-attack?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other","text":"Are you safe or not safe? That was the question if you were in London yesterday. Photograph: Facebook/PA This morning, after reading the latest news updates about the terror attack on Westminster, I fired up Facebook. There I was met with an atypical request: a friend who lives an eight-hour flight away in Canada had asked me to mark myself “safe”. Clicking on the notification took me to Facebook’s Safety Check page, which revealed that 31 of my friends were marked as safe, and 249 of my friends were “not marked as safe”. The notion that these London-based friends were somehow in peril from an attack that was neutralised many hours ago seemed absurd to me in London. But it probably doesn’t seem quite so silly to people’s friends in New Zealand or Nigeria, who might not be so up to speed. Safety Check works in a fairly simple way: “If you’re in the affected area, you can tell your friends you’re safe and check to see if they’re safe, too,” the company says. But the inevitable dichotomy this process creates – if you are in London during such a catastrophe, you are presumed unsafe until you have checked in as safe – is hopelessly inadequate in a city where 8.7 million people live. The attack on the Palace of Westminster was grave and tragic, but, as rapidly became apparent, it was also crudely undertaken and successfully contained by the police and emergency services. Four people died during the atrocity, 29 people were injured. The need for a vast network of people to check in as safe when only a small fraction of the city was in peril doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny. The problem is one of scale. On the mobile version of Facebook’s Safety Check page, the “affected area” shows a map encompassing as far north as Watford, Hertfordshire, as far west as Slough, Berkshire and as far east as Basildon, Essex. Such an area is more suited to be “affected” by a thermonuclear weapon than such a crude attack in Westminster. In some ways, of course, it makes sense: since the Victorian railway boom, the south-east’s growing army of commuters have come to rely on London as a place to work but not necessarily live. This is especially the case for places such as Westminster or the City of London, which ebb and flow with the tide of civil servants or bankers each day. But Facebook friends who don’t commute to London at all, only visiting the city and “checking in” to different locations from time to time, had also marked themselves as safe, some after friends had requested them to do so. Their friends were probably compelled to enquire after Facebook chose to turn on Safety Check, the action sowing a seed of doubt. It’s the reason my friend asked me. “London is huge so I thought it was very unlikely but then Facebook freaks you out with those ‘not confirmed safe’ statuses,” he wrote to me on Messenger after I’d got in touch to tell him I was OK. “It’s super manipulative, and I knew it, but felt the need to go through with it anyway.” When it was launched in 2014, Safety Check was intended as a tool to let loved ones know you are safe during a natural disaster. It was inspired by the aftermath of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami in 2011, with Facebook’s Japanese engineers wishing to develop a tool to help people make contact during and after disasters. Facebook first turned Safety Check on for a terror attack after the Paris attacks in November 2015. As much as it was praised for its role in the French capital, it was pilloried for not using the feature for other, non-western attacks. Yet Facebook’s corrective action has sometimes resulted in the spread of fear and falsehoods. In March 2016, Facebook pushed its Safety Check notification following a suicide bombing in Lahore to users as far away as Hawaii, New York and the UK. In Bangkok on Boxing Day 2016, users in the Thailand capital were asked to mark themselves as safe from the “Explosion in Bangkok”. Facebook’s intervention was justified by a link to a BBC news piece about an explosion rocking central Bangkok. But the link was to a video from August 2015. No such event had occurred that day, only a protest reportedly consisting of one man throwing “ping-pong bombs” and firecrackers off the roof of a government building. The problem of how to judge whether an attack is of a large enough scale is a tricky one for Facebook. Algorithmically, turning it on made perfect sense. Yesterday, feeds inevitably filled with people sharing information about their whereabouts and news articles as events unfolded in Westminster. It just wasn’t the large-scale physical event that Safety Check was designed for. There is no doubt that for many Londoners the simple act of checking in that you were safe allayed the fears of far-off loved ones. But it also spread unnecessary worry about people who were simply nowhere near the affected area.

The unarmed Metropolitan Police officer was stabbed to death by Isis supporter Khalid Masood after he rammed his car into pedestrians in Westminster Bridge and ran towards parliament armed with knives. The 48-year-old was jointly awarded the national Police Bravery Award with another officer who fought the London Bridge attackers and was put in a coma by his injuries. Read more Receiving the accolade on PC Palmer’s behalf, PC Shaun Cartwright described his best friend as the “perfect policeman”. “He wouldn't have made a fuss at all – doing his job, that was Keith…it’s a dangerous job but everybody does the job and that’s how Keith would have viewed it,” he told officers and politicians gathered at an award ceremony in London. “It’s a shame that all the accolades that he gets now he’s not here to receive them in person, because he truly deserves them.” PC Palmer, who was married with a young daughter, has also been posthumously awarded the George Medal for gallantry and tens of thousands of people lined the route of his funeral procession. His colleague and best friend PC Cartwright told how he was getting changed ready to take over his guard post at the gates to the Houses of Parliament when the attack took place. He emerged to see PC Palmer gravely injured on the ground as police officers, security guards, politicians and paramedics worked to save his life. Police line London streets in memory of Pc Keith Palmer By confronting Masood, he had bought time for armed officers to shoot the terrorist, and both were pronounced dead at the scene. “If there was somebody that was going to stand in the way it would have been Keith, he was that brave person that would stand his ground and he bought time for everybody else who was inside the building,” PC Cartwright said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said both PC Palmer and PC Charlie Guenigault, who survived the injuries he sustained during the London Bridge attack, had “put their lives on the line to confront armed terrorists”. “We will never forget the terror brought to our shores in 2017 and the extraordinary acts by so many officers and so many other people,” she added. PC Guenigault was on his way home from a drink with friends when the London Bridge attackers ploughed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and started a knife rampage in Borough Market last June. “Suddenly I heard a man saying ‘I’ve been stabbed’,” he recalled. “I looked over and it was one, two, three of them in a row and I saw the knives in their hands…I just went running over and barged into the entire group.” PC Guenigault was stabbed and slashed in the back, head, face and eye, sustaining injuries that left him in a coma for three days and caused his spleen to be removed.

PC Guenigault paid tribute to PC Palmer for making the “ultimate sacrifice”, adding: “It’s nice to be here and be recognised, but at the end of the day I’m alive, I still get to see my friends and my family get to see me. To me that’s the biggest thing.” Wayne Marques, an unarmed British Transport Police officer, also fought the London Bridge attackers and sustained severe injuries.

Sajid Javid, who quipped that he was “still the home secretary as we speak”, told audience members they were “truly the best police service in the world”. “We are deeply indebted and immensely proud of the courageous policemen and women who regularly risk their own safety to protect the people of Britain,” he said. “The last couple of years have put the bravery of all police forces in England and Wales to the test and I would like to pay special tribute to PC Keith Palmer who paid the ultimate price defending our Parliament. “The Police Bravery Awards celebrate the commitment, dedication and resilience of the entire police service – and all officers nominated stand as an example to us all.” Police Bravery Awards nominees in the garden of 10 Downing Street on 12 July 2018 (Police Federation of England and Wales. ) The regional winners were: Northumbria: PCs Gary Sharpe and Victoria Threadgold confronted and disarmed a man waving a 4ft samurai sword at them and later a handgun. Midlands West Mercia: PC Kimberley Morris gave vital first aid to a stabbing victim, while keeping the suspected attacker talking and in view while back up arrived. Eastern Norfolk: A man came at lone officer PC Frances Peters with a sword in each hand. Using her Pava spray and personal safety skills she restrained and handcuffed him until other officers arrived. South East Thames Valley: Off duty officer Sergeant Mark Allmond and PC Alex Quigley followed and detained a man who had killed a stranger in Poundland. The man was walking the streets still clutching the knife and making threats when the officers intervened. South West Wiltshire: Inspector Ian Stevenson pulled a vulnerable woman off a railway track just as a train was approaching. The train missed them by a couple of feet in a scene his colleague described as “like something out of a movie”. Wales North Wales: PCs David Hall and Rhys Rushby were attacked by a wanted murder suspect with a claw hammer.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/03/23/theresa-may-islamist-westminster-attack/","text":"Theresa May says ‘Islamist’ Westminster Attack ‘Not Islamic’ The Prime Minister has said the “Islamist” attack on Parliament was not “Islamic” and Islam is a “great faith”. Taking on the role of a theologian, Theresa May insisted: “It is wrong to describe this as Islamic terrorism. It is Islamist terrorism. It is a perversion of a great faith.” Speaking in Parliament, she also said the attack showed “the importance of all of our faiths working together, and recognising the values that we share”. Adding: “This act of terror was not an act of faith. It was a perversion; a warped ideology, which leads to an act of terrorism like that and it will not prevail.” Islamism is generally defined as a political interpretation of Islam. Some critics argue Islam is intrinsically political – as the Quran mandates a religious state and law – and say the term is irrelevant. MPs almost unanimously agreed with the Prime Minister, lining up to warn against “demonising” and “stigmatising” Muslims, and to condemn “Islamophobia” and “racial and religious” discrimination. Khalid Mahmood, the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said the attacker or attackers “pretend to be of a particular religion”. “If they were of a religion they would not be carrying out acts like this,” he added. Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, added: “People who commit acts of terrorism in the name of Islam do not speak for the majority of Muslims in this country.” UKIP leader Paul Nuttall, meanwhile, did not shy away from describing the attack as “Islamic”. “We have a cancer within a particular community and it needs to be cut out,” he told Sky News outside Westminster Palace. “The Muslim community I believe needs to do more about this. “We have the problem that we have 800 British citizens out fighting in Syria and Iraq for Islamic State. “I don’t believe they should be

Relatives of those killed in Khalid Masood’s car and knife rampage said they could not understand why radical material was still freely available online, or why web giants needed to offer encrypted messaging services. Gareth Patterson QC, representing the families, called for the coroner to examine the problems that are highlighted in \"terrorist trial after terrorist trial\" at the Old Bailey. Khalid Masood, 52, was shot dead by police after he drove a rental car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge then fatally stabbed Pc Keith Palmer, 48, as he stood guard at the Palace of Westminster. A pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey on Monday heard there was “a high public interest in a comprehensive public investigation”. Mr Patterson said problems repeatedly highlighted in terrorist trials included \"the internet, end to end encryption, and radicalisation in prison and failure to get to grips with these problems which occur again and again\". Calling on the coroner to shed light on these problems, he said: \"Terrorist trial after terrorist trial shows the same problems featuring in the evidence.\" He went on: \"Why is it that radical material continues to be freely available on the internet, we do not understand.\" The attack wounded dozens of peopleCredit: Simon Dawson/ Bloomberg Mr Patterson said he also wanted the inquest to shed light on “how it was this attacker was able to get through those gates and how it was Pc Palmer was apparently stationed alone and unarmed with, it seems, inadequate body protection. \"We would positively encourage further investigation into those areas.\" An inquest into the deaths of the victims will be heard before Coroner Lucraft at the Old Bailey from September 10 and last up to four weeks. A separate jury inquest would follow immediately afterwards into the death of Masood, the court heard. Mr Lucraft began proceedings offering his condolences to the families of the dead. He said the events of March 22, 2017 had been “less than two minutes of high and terrible drama”. Lawyers representing the Home Office said the issue of end-to-end encryption is too broad for an inquest and is a matter of 'legislation and social policy'. The court heard the inquest would examine Masood's history and his movements before the attack. A \"psychological autopsy\" would provide a mental profile of him. A further pre-inquest hearing is likely to be heard in June, ahead of the full inquest in the autumn.","title":"Westminster Bridge terror attack relatives demand answers on UK failure to tackle web

The fund had surpassed £9,000 at the time of publication and was continuing to rise rapidly. Muddassar Ahmed said he started the fund after witnessing the attack, having entered Portcullis House just 10 minutes before terror struck and being barricaded inside for four hours. Sadiq Khan on the Westminster attack: \"Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism\" “I was shocked to see the injuries and loss of life outside my window,” he wrote. “I reflected on what it means to be a born-and-bred Londoner and found myself proud of how security and medical services responded, how ordinary passers-by offered first aid, and what our Parliament means to me, an institution that is the oldest of its kind in the world and how, regardless of our critiques of government policies or political parties, remains an institution that reflects how the will of the people can be expressed with civility and dignity.” The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) commended the Metropolitan Police, emergency services, Prime Minister and Mayor of London for their response to Wednesday’s atrocity, which has been claimed by Isis. Two members of the public – British mother Aysha Frade and American tourist Kurt Cochran – were killed as the attacker ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before crashing it into railings guarding the Houses of Parliament. He ran to one of the entrances and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer before being shot dead by an armed officer. Mr Khan, who will be joining a memorial for the victims to be half in Trafalgar Square, hailed Mr Palmer’s bravery and thanked the police and emergency services.

The MCB is the UK’s largest Muslim umbrella organisation and represents more than 500 national and local groups, mosques, charities and schools. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, urged Muslims to be “vigilant” against the dangers of Islamist ideology and hate preachers. He urged people to ensure young people know “true Islam” from online propaganda to help them combat the risk of grooming and radicalistation. “Terrorists want to attack London is because they hate the fact that we don’t just tolerate each other – whether you’re a Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, member of an organised faith or not, we respect, embrace and celebrate each other and

It also called on the UK government to enact policies that will bring an end to the “global cycles of violence”. Dr Adnan Siddiqui, its director, said: We express our deepest sympathies to all those who have lost their lives in this incident and to those many injured. While we accept that the security services and the police play a crucial role in keeping the public safe, such attacks which require very little planning cannot be thwarted by ever more securitisation and policing of communities. Reactionary policies in the UK have a global ramification and it is important that the government leads with policies that seek to end the global cycles of violence rather than further them. World leaders have condemned the attack in Westminster. The US president, Donald Trump, offered his condolences during a call to the prime minister, Theresa May, the White House said. He also pledged the “full cooperation and support of the United States government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice”. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, also condemned the attack: I was shocked and saddened to learn of the innocent people who were killed and injured as a result of this cowardly attack. Canada and the UK are the closest of friends and allies. Our friendship is based on shared values and history – indeed, Canada’s parliament is a descendant of the chamber targeted this morning. Today’s attack on the UK parliament is an attack on democracies around the world. The Canadian parliament withstood a similar attack not so long ago by those who sought to instil fear and divide Canadians against themselves. Instead, Canadians came together. I am confident the British people will do the same, and will emerge from their grief stronger and more united than ever before. On behalf of all Canadians, I offer our full support to prime minister May and to the people of the United Kingdom. We stand ready to offer all possible assistance to the British government, to do what we can to bring to justice those responsible for this heinous act. Canadians stand united with the British people in the fight against terrorism. We will continue to work together with the UK and all our allies to show the world that freedom and democracy will always triumph. The leader of the Democrats in the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, also released a statement: Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, survivors, and people of the United Kingdom. The American people share in the outrage and horror at this brutal terrorist attack in London. The special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States has been critical to securing peace around the world. Together, we will remain strong and smart as we confront terrorists and defeat the threats to our nations. The United Kingdom will always have a friend and partner in the American people. Some clarification from the Met police. Acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley said earlier that the officer who was killed was armed. “It has now been confirmed that he was not armed,” Scotland Yard says. Prime minister's statement on today's attack I have just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee, Cobra, following the sick and depraved terrorist attack on the streets of our capital this afternoon. The full details of exactly what happened are still emerging. But, having been updated by police and security officials, I can confirm that this appalling incident began when a single attacker drove his vehicle into pedestrians walking across Westminster bridge, killing two people and injuring many more, including three police officers. This attacker, who was armed with a knife, then ran towards Parliament, where he was confronted by the police officers who keep us and our democratic institutions safe. Tragically, one officer was killed. The terrorist was also shot dead. The United Kingdom’s threat level has been set at severe for some time and this will not change. Acting deputy commissioner Rowley will give a further operational update later this evening. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all who have been affected; to the victims themselves and their family and friends who waved their loved ones off, but will not now be welcoming them home. For those of us who were in Parliament at the time of this attack, these events provide a particular reminder of the exceptional bravery of our police and security services who risk their lives to keep us safe. Once again today, these exceptional men and women ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way. On behalf of the whole country, I want to pay tribute to them and to all our emergency services for the work they have been doing to reassure the public and bring security back to the streets of our capital city. That they have lost one of their own in today’s attack only makes their calmness and professionalism under pressure all the more remarkable. The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city, where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech. These streets of Westminster – home to the world’s oldest parliament – are engrained with a spirit of freedom that echoes in some of the furthest corners of the globe. And the values our parliament represents – democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law – command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. That is why it is a target for those who reject those values. But let me make it clear today, as I have had cause to do before: any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to failure. Tomorrow morning, Parliament will meet as normal. We will come together as normal. And Londoners - and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great city - will get up and go about their day as normal. They will board their trains, they will leave their hotels, they will walk these streets, they will live their lives. And we will all move forward together. Never giving in to terror. And never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart. May says it is no accident that the attacker chose parliament which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law. She said that was why it is a target for those who reject those values, adding that any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to fail. Parliament will be open as normal tomorrow.

The page owner is responsible for the distribution of funds raised. Story Money doesn't replace lives, but can help towards funeral costs, medical costs(even in the future). Being from London I know the impact today has had not only on our beautiful city but also in solidarity around the world as we remember loved ones taken too soon by acts of terrorism. There is nothing we can do other than send our love to the victims and try to provide a supportive cushion of what we know is going to be a very long and harrowing process. This fund will be split between the families of the victims. It's our way of showing support and standing together against those who try to tear us down. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39359158 Share this story Updates 11 1 year ago Steve Woody 1 year ago Another update. I'm just reached out to JustGiving again as I've heard nothing back since they told me they were looking into the best way to distribute the funds. I've shared my concern that the right people get the donations so the money is divided fairly. I'll keep you updated. Share this update to help us raise more 1 year ago Steve Woody 1 year ago Just an update. I can't distripute any of the funds right now as Just Giving are holding all funds relating to all westminster accounts whilst they try to establish the best way to ensure that everything is distributed in the right way. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to say where it goes or if they are taking it over so I'll keep you updated when I know more. Share this update to help us raise more 1 year ago Steve Woody 1 year ago Just to make sure everyone is kept upto date. I've received details from MPS regarding PC Palmer. As stated previously I think other funding options were very successful and well over 750.000 was raised for this appeal so I will be dividing the money between the additional families.","title":"Crowdfunding to Support the families of the lives lost during the March 22nd Attack on London. on

{"originalUrl":"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/how-the-right-framed-the-westminster-attacks/","text":"How the Right framed the Westminster attacks The Westminster attacks provided the occasion for anti-immigration, anti-refugee politicians the world over to vindicate their positions in the public narrative. It was not just Britain First and the English Defence League which tried to make political capital out of the deadly attacks in Westminster on 22 March. UK-based politicians and international figures were not slow to add their very unhelpful pennyworths to the supposed analysis of what had gone wrong. At first politicians were blaming migration, as well as asylum policies. When it emerged that the perpetrator, Khalid Masood, was British, politicians shifted their attack to failed multiculturalism. Just hours after the Westminster attacks, Donald Trump Jr. implied in a tweet that London Mayor Sadiq Khan was weak on terrorism. The US president’s eldest son in fact tweeted a link to a two-year-old 2015 story quoting Khan saying terror attacks were ‘part and parcel of living in a big city’. Nothing at all to do with what had happened at Westminster that day. This sleight of hand angered Wes Streeting, MP for Ilford North so much that he tweeted back, ‘You use a terrorist attack on our city to attack London’s Mayor for your own political gain. You’re a disgrace.’ UKIP’s Nigel Farage on Fox News and in other US TV appearances used the event to claim the attacks showed that Trump’s ‘hardline immigration and anti-Muslim policies were correct’. Multiculturalism in the UK had led to ‘divided communities’ and there was now a ‘fifth column living inside … European countries’. Farage also claimed that under Tony Blair’s New Labour, the government had boasted of sending ‘out search parties to find immigrants from all over the world to come to Britain’. While Farage went for Blair, it’s former political donor Arron Banks went for Tory May. He tweeted that ‘over a million illegals’ came into the UK when May was home secretary and ‘we have a huge Islamic problem courtesy of mass immigration’. In its first tweet, Leave.EU too, responded to the attack by linking it to the actions of the prime minister who had allowed ‘unprecedented levels of immigration’ and failed to ‘secure borders’. As it emerged that Khalid Masood was British, it responded by tweeting that ‘British-born means nothing, if he lived in a segregated community and hated the British way of life’. And Katie Hopkins (famous for being Katie Hopkins and nasty) had already told US TV viewers that Great Britain was ‘a nation of ghettoes’. Foreign politicians were quick to seize on the event to justify repressive policies at home. FN leader, Marine Le Pen, speaking on French radio, said that the attack showed that ‘we must control our borders’. For Poland’s extreme-right prime minister Beata Szydlo, it was impossible ‘not to connect’ Europe’s ‘migration policy with terrorism’ and [that] the attacks vindicated Warsaw’s refusal to take in refugees under the EU’s quota system. And Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, held that the attack showed that Australia’s decision to reject 500 asylum seekers over security fears was certainly ‘prudent’. It does not seem to matter that the perpetrator of the Westminster attacks was neither an asylum seeker nor an immigrant, or that he was found not to be connected to any terrorist group. The event had provided the occasion for rightists the world over to vindicate their positions in the public narrative. Comments The left and right are both cheeks of the same arse. The Tories, UKIP and right wing parties discriminate and create a growth in economic inequality, and the middle class dominated ‘left’ handwring, criticise, but don’t actually do anything to stop the

{"originalUrl":"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/783758/Westminster-terror-attack-Parliament-security","text":"Despite this, Scotland Yard's anti-terror chief has insisted that current arrangements are \"proportionate\". IG The last photograph of PC Keith Palmer, 45 minutes before his tragic death Our current arrangements have been developed with Parliament over many years and are designed to provide access to the seat of our government balanced with security that is proportionate but not overly intrusive Mark Rowley Mark Rowley said that procedures for keeping Parliament safe had been designed so they were not \"overly intrusive\". He said: \"Our current arrangements have been developed with Parliament over many years and are designed to provide access to the seat of our government balanced with security that is proportionate but not overly intrusive.\" Parliament's main entrance has two sets of large metal gates which allow vehicles to enter and exit the estate. A pair of smaller gates were introduced recently with two police officers at each to check passes and allow cyclists, cars and delivery drivers to come in. There are usually armed police present just inside the entrance gate. More armed police are also present after the final checkpoint. AP The latest revelation has raised fresh questions that the terror carnage would have been even worse She said: \"The one weak spot on our estate is those Carriage Gates. We have four police officers there. Two on the gate going in, two on the gate going out. \"We see them every day, we’re friends with lots of them. I think we will need to look at security at the Palace in the wake of this incident but this is a plan for another day. It’s a terrible, terrible day for Parliament.” \"It’s a terrible, terrible day for Parliament.\" Former Met firearms officer Roger Gay said Britain may now need to move away from the idea of unarmed policeman in important locations. He told Sky News: \"In my opinion, I would have all of them in that location, I think, should be armed. What you have there, and I hate to use the term, is perhaps a sacrificial pawn. \"But one wonders if he had a sidearm, would he have been able to react that quickly and, if he had been carrying a carbine then he would be less of the traditional policeman.

{"originalUrl":"http://theramblinginfidel.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/some-notes-on-westminister-attack.html","text":"Thursday, 23 March 2017 Notes on Westminister Attack Tragedy strikes Europe. Yesterday afternoon, on the anniversary of the Brussels attacks from last year, London was on the end of a terrorist assault. According to the BBC, Three people have died and at least 40 have been injured after an attacker drove a car along a pavement in Westminster, stabbed a policeman and was shot dead by police in the grounds of Parliament. The dead police officer - who was unarmed as the attacker charged over and stabbed him - is known as PC Keith Palmer, aged 48, a husband and a father. His former colleague in the Royal Artillery and Conservative MP James Cleverly, paid tribute to him by describing him as a \"lovely man\". Another victim has been named as 43 year old, mother of two and Spanish language teacher, Aysha Frade. Aysha was mowed down by a the grey Hyundai 4x4 as she walked over Westminster Bridge to collect her two daughters, aged 8 and 11. The third victim was American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was on the final day holiday with his wife celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary when he was killed. At least 40 people are known to have been injured. Among them twelve Britons, four South Koreans, three French youngsters on a school trip, two Romanians, two Greeks, one German, one Polish national, one Irish citizen, one American citizen, one Chinese and one Italian. This attack was an act of Islamist terrorism, ISIS recently claimed responsibility, praising the attacker - a British born jihadist named Khalid Masood- as a \"soldier of the Islamic state\". However, it remains to be seen whether the attack was directed by ISIS , or inspired by them. It seems more likely that it was the latter, not the former. As usual, after every one of these tragedies, we subject ourselves to the same rituals we always go through. It really is tiring and immensely frustrating to see one side act as if there is no problem, or if they do they severely simplify and misdiagnose the problem, while the other side will exploit what is a legitimate issue in order to spread bigotry, hatred and unneccessary, irrational fear. I write this first and foremost as a human being, who has a sense of empathy, compassion and solidarity with my fellow creatures. In the aftermath of every terrorist attack, All of my thoughts and condolences are with the victims and their families, before anything else. They are the ones whose lives have been taken from them, unable to ever embrace their parents, wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, children and friends again. Just imagine being the children of Aysha Frade, eagerly waiting for their mother at school, looking forward to going home to spend time with the family, only to realise that someone had taken her life. Imagine being the wife of PC Palmer, who everyday says goodbye to her husband as he goes off to work always expecting he will return home from his shift safely, but this time, on this day, he doesn't. Nothing is worse than that and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Many have described yesterday's assault as an \"attack on democracy\", or as Theresa May put it, \"a shot against our values of ‘democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law\". True, this Jihadist scumbag and his ideological ilk do hate these values and their universality because it is in direct opposition to everything they stand for: one set of values sets the conditions for human flourishing, happiness and emancipation, while the other set can only bring death, misery and enslavement. However, let us have some perspective. No individual, no matter how well armed they are, no matter how determined, no matter how committed he is to his cause, can overthrow democracy or enslave a free people. These hard won rights and liberties that previous generations have struggled for are too robust, too vigarous, too steeped in the consciousness of all generations, to be overthrown by a twisted zealot with a weaponised vehicle, a knife, and a perverse belief in a reward of 72 virgins in a celestial orgy for killing 'the kuffar'. The only way the terrorist would have any impact on democracy and freedom is if we give him an enourmous helping hand. It will be our response as a society to this act of barbarity that will decide whether democracy is under attack or not. You can rest assured vile bigots and Muslimaphobic chauvanists who desire to stigmatise and demonise an entire community, are talking this attack up as an act of war, the latest blow by an Islamic army slowly, stealthily conquering Europe. These merchants of racism from the far-right have no other purpose but to spread irrational fear and hatred. They claimed Britain was \"cowed\" by the crime and London was \"shut down\" and under \"lockdown\" as a result of the attack. This is of course a total falsehood, London carried on as normal and people were not cowed and went about their business as usual. All these people desire is the power to subjugate and stigmatise muslims, and they seek to undermine the idea that peoples of different faiths can coexist with each other and build a society. Meanwhile those often labelled \"the regressive left\" will indulge themselves in a toxic mix of victim blaming, masochism and a self hatred before the blood of the victims is even allowed to dry, desperately peddling 'grievance' and 'root cause' narratives of how 'we' brought this horror on ourselves; of how these are the deserved punishements for our numerous crimes and iniquities; of why we somehow triggered this poor guy to slam a car into a pedestrians and slit a man's throat. I have said it before and I will say it again: do not give me this crap that jihadist atrocities are a response (or shall we say 'blowback') to western imperialism. ISIS are not anti-imperialists, or some strange Islamic version of liberation theology. They are pro-imperialism, they seek to revive a lost empire: their imagined caliphate. This is what their Islamic state project is all about, imposing a purritanical, theocratic fascist empire, first in the muslim world, then across the whole world. Obviously, this project is so utopian and so irrational that it could never be fully established, but let us be clear on their intentions and the character of their ideology. In response to these two pathologies, we cannot surrender ourselves to the culture of fear and the politics of suspicion because it will potentially lead to us down the barren road of petty authoritarianism, the security state and foul assaults on the liberties which supposedly needed to be defended from the Islamist threat. While it is understandable and proper that we focus on the tragic nature of this attack and the challenges around other potential attack it provokes. Let us not forget the bravery, heroism and humanity that was on display in the midst of such savagery and the international solidarity and sympathy. We may have seen the worst of humanity, but we also saw the best of it. Our response to yesterday's assault should be to demand more freedom and democracy, not less. It should be to never allow hatred and fear to colonise our hearts. It should be to remember the victims, their memory and humanise them, as opposed to the manner the terrorist dehumanised them. Ultimately, it is to do everything within our power to make sure that while this bloody, savage act may have succeeded in impacting awfully on scores of innocent people, it will have no impact on our values, our political life, our daily lives, and our sense of security. This, of course, on its own won't solve the challenges the global threat we all face from the Jihadist internationale, but it is neccessary step to even begin dealing with the challenge. We must resist terrorism not complete it. 1 comment: I am in my early 40s and have never had a happy relationships or marriages because of the terrible mistake I made in my youthful age (15 years ago), though I have been married for 3times now. This story is ugly but I must share it to clear my conscience and pave the way for a new beginning in life. I broke two homes; their marriage did not mean anything to me as much as I gets what I want. It was fun until I got married, then karma started. My first husband was a cheating machine with both women and men, the second was nothing to write home about. I visited a therapist immediately the second left, to make sure I do not have broken home again, but the third which I have married for a year and two months took in another girl and demanded I leave his house. I did not see that one coming. To cut it shot; dr. wakina via (dr.wakinalovetemple@gmail.com) showed me mercy by rewriting history with a special love spell. Asked me to first go and plead for forgiveness from the homes I broke before the spell can take effect, it was not an easy task, in fact it was a suicide mission but was success. The spell took effect immediately I forgave myself, something strange began to happen, I saw shadows running off my body that morning, my husband who despised me so much did not only call but came to pick me from work to a romantic dinner. Over a year now, my husband has remained a loving and romantic man. I learnt my lesson. Thank you doctor wakina.","title":"The Rambling Infidel: Notes on Westminister

{"originalUrl":"https://wayback.archive.org/web/20170322220009/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39359158","text":"Four people, including a police officer and the lone attacker, have died in a terror attack near the Houses of Parliament in London. Two of those killed were among more than 20 pedestrians hit by a car on Westminster Bridge, before it crashed. The man stabbed the officer outside Parliament before being shot dead. PM Theresa May said it was a \"sick and depraved\" attack on the heart of the capital and attempts to defeat UK values were \"doomed to failure\". Speaking in Downing Street after chairing a meeting of the government's Cobra emergencies committee, Mrs May paid tribute to the \"exceptional men and women\" of the police force who responded to the attack. \"We will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart,\" she said. The prime minister added: \"The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.\" Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said a major investigation was under way into the \"marauding terrorist attack\". He said emergency services were called at 14.40 GMT after the car was driven over Westminster Bridge, hitting and injuring a number of members of the public and three police officers, who were on their way back from a commendation ceremony. After the car crashed into the railings of the Houses of Parliament, a man armed with a knife \"continued the attack\" and tried to enter the building. Eyewitnesses said police fired three or four gunshots as the knifeman lunged towards a second officer. 13 students from Edge Hill University in Lancashire were also caught up in the incident - two were taken to hospital and described as walking wounded; two others had minor injuries There are two police casualty bureau numbers: 0800 056 0944 and 0207 158 0010 for people worried about family and friends, or eyewitnesses Kings College Hospital says eight patients are being treated there - six male, and two female. Two are critical and two are stable St Thomas' Hospital said two patients had been admitted - both are stable The Port of London Authority said a woman was pulled alive from the River Thames near the bridge and was being treated for serious injuries Analysis Image copyrightAPImage caption A man believed to be the suspect received medical treatment By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent The incident outside Westminster is exactly the kind of scenario that security chiefs have been planning for. It looks like the type of attack jihadis have wanted to carry out in Britain - namely attacking people with a vehicle and taking on the security forces with knives. In the security services' jargon this is known as a \"marauding attack\" and is the hardest type of terrorist incident to predict and defend against. That means casualties, as we have seen in Nice and elsewhere, are inevitable. But what matters just as much is how the police then respond. Armed police at Parliament were able to stop the attacker. Within minutes, Westminster was flooded with more armed officers, including counter-terrorism specialists. Inside Scotland Yard, teams of detectives began working on the next critical phase - establishing the suspect's movements, whether he acted alone and, in tandem with their colleagues on the street, making sure London is as secure as it can be in light of these awful events. Westminster remains locked down and it will remain so until Scotland Yard is certain the threat has been contained.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2017/03/british-mps-return-westminster-attack/","text":"New arrests as British police release photo of parliament attacker March 25, 2017 4:41 am By AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE, London, United Kingdom, Mar 23 – British police said Friday they had made further “significant” arrests over the Islamist-inspired terror attack on parliament, as they released the first picture of the homegrown killer who left four people dead. Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old Briton with a history of violent offences but no terrorist convictions, was shot by police on Wednesday after a rampage through Westminster. Two other suspects are in custody following searches at 21 locations, mostly around London, in the central city of Birmingham and in the northwestern city of Manchester. The Islamic State group claimed that Britain’s deadliest terror attack in 12 years was conducted by one of its “soldiers” acting on a call to target countries in the US-led coalition fighting the jihadists. Police said there was no further threat, but counter-terrorism commander Mark Rowley said they were trying to establish whether Masood acted alone “or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him”. Released by police, the passport-style photo of Masood, who also used the names Adrian Elms and Adrian Russell Ajao among other aliases, shows a mixed race man with a shaved head and a beard. Prime Minister Theresa May has said he was known to intelligence services as a “peripheral” figure some years ago but there was no warning of his plans to stage an attack. At least 50 people from 12 different countries were injured when Masood ploughed his rented car into crowds of people walking along the pavement on Westminster Bridge, before crashing the vehicle into the fence outside parliament. Three people on the bridge died after being hit by the speeding car, then the attacker leapt out and fatally stabbed a police officer just inside the gates of the Houses of Parliament before being shot dead. Rowley described the overnight arrests of two men aged 27 and 35 in Birmingham and Manchester as “significant”. – Numerous aliases – The death toll rose late Thursday after life support was withdrawn from a 75-year-old man injured in the attack, whom police named as Leslie Rhodes from south London. The other victims were 48-year-old policeman Keith Palmer and, on the bridge, 43-year-old Briton Aysha Frade, who was on her way to pick up her two daughters, and an American citizen in his 50s, Kurt Cochran. Born into a middle-class family in Kent in southeast England, Masood was described by schoolmates as a popular, “happy-go-lucky” student who excelled academically and at sport. They told the Daily Mail that he later began drinking and using drugs and slipped into criminal behaviour, receiving convictions for assault and possession of offensive weapons between 1983 and 2003. A report dating back to November 2000 shows he was sentenced to two years in prison for slashing the face of a cafe owner in a village in southern England where he lived with his family. According to The Sun tabloid, he married a Muslim woman in 2004 and moved the following year to Saudi Arabia to teach English, returning in 2009, but officials could not confirm this. The Saudi embassy in London on Friday issued a statement saying that Masood was not known to their security services “and does not have a criminal record in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” Police chief Rowley said police were “looking at his history” and appealed to the public to come forward with any information about him. “Our investigation focuses on understanding his motivation, preparation and associates,” he said. A total of 11 people have been arrested over the attack, their ages ranging from 21 to 58, all on suspicion of preparation of terrorist attacks. All four women have since been released, one on bail, while five of the men were also released, according to police. – Peaceful future – Faith leaders including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the chief rabbi and the chief imam of London’s central mosque on Friday gathered near the attack site to remember the victims. “In standing here, we represent the three Abrahamic faith communities, all equally committed to a peaceful future,” Welby said after observing a minute’s silence outside Westminster Abbey. Lawmakers returned to work as normal on Thursday morning, even as forensic officers worked at the scene, but a review of parliamentary security is now under way. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, whose attempts to save police officer Palmer were widely praised, was on Friday appointed to the Privy Council, a prestigious role usually reserved for senior ministers, as a reward for his efforts. The IS group said it was responsible for Masood’s actions without naming him, according to the Amaq propaganda agency — its first claim for an attack on British soil. It was the deadliest in Britain since four homegrown suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city’s transport system in July 2005. The attack had echoes of the atrocities in Nice and Berlin when trucks ploughed into crowds of people, killing 86 people in the French Riviera city in July and 12 at a market in the German capital just days before Christmas.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/782783/London-terror-attack-westminster-hilary-benn-chris-bryant-houses-of-parlia","text":"POLITICIANS have revealed they were \"expecting\" an attack on Westminster following the horrific terror strike which left five dead and 40 injured. Former Labour frontbencher Hilary Benn said he was “expecting something like this” to happen, while Chris Bryant MP said the iconic Houses of Parliament were always going to be a target for would-be terrorists. Mr Benn was coming out of the division lobbies in Parliament when the attack had occurred and remained trapped inside the Westminster Palace for a number of hours as police attempted to bring the situation under control. Related articles I think we have all been expecting something like this to happen at some time in some part of our country Hilary Benn The Leeds Central MP told the Express.co.uk: “Honestly, I think we have all been expecting something like this to happen at some time in some part of our country. “It’s why the police and intelligence services consistently have said consistently and rightly that an attack was highly likely. “They have been absolutely honest with the public in saying we are working day in, day out to protect us and they do an extraordinary job. GETTY Officials look for evidence on Westminster Bridge “But they were also being truthful that it is not possible to stop every attack. “Therefore I suppose I felt at some point, something like this would happen. “But it doesn’t lessen the shock and the pain and sense of grief for, above all, for the families of those who have lost their lives will feel tonight as they realise the loved one they waved off this morning isn’t coming home.” Fellow Labour MP Mr Bryant, who was in the tea room waiting for the second vote in the House of Commons at the time of the attack, also expected a similar horrific event to strike Britain. He said: “I’ve been involved in all these discussions in the House of Commons for quite some time, I was always saying an MP would one day be killed, probably in their constituency, and that happened last summer. He added: “We have always known that building is a target, that’s just a fact. Sometimes its disturbed individuals… but we are a democracy, and the most important thing is that we sit tomorrow… no one will destroy the sprit of the British people.” GETTY Police are continuing their search The Rhondda MP added a member of his staff may have seen some of the carnage which ensued outside Parliament. Mr Bryant said: “My first thought was whether my staff were OK. My office looks straight down onto the area where everything took place. “We could not get very much information but I think my member of staff may have seen some of what might have happened so I’m

{"originalUrl":"https://www.rt.com/uk/382544-cage-westminster-attack-terrorism/#.WNrJNPdvr74.twitter","text":"War on Terror & neo-con agenda to blame for Westminster attack, says rights group The West’s violent policies at home and abroad were major factors in bringing about the Westminster attack, but British authorities are in denial, according to the advocacy NGO Cage. Four people were killed and up to 50 wounded on March 15 when British-born Khalid Masood ploughed a car into a crowded area on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer. Masood was also shot dead at the scene. Cage, a human rights organization that examines the impact of measures taken in the War on Terror, warned that, though the attack is being widely blamed on a violent ideology, no attention has been paid to where that ideology actually came from. The charity insists that the violent ideas motivating the deadly assault stemmed from flaws in Britain’s own defense and security policies. “We must acknowledge that the global ‘War on Terror’ has unleashed an endless cycle of violence and murder that has caused immeasurable grief and pain, and will only continue to do so if we do not seek constructive ways to end it,” Cage said in a statement. “We must have the courage and honesty to accept that if the inspiration for the Westminster incident and others like it, are groups and individuals in war torn areas, as many are claiming, then the circumstances which led to the war may also be part of the problem,” it added. The charity warned that the nation’s domestic policy concerning Muslims also played a role in the attack. “The relationship between foreign wars and domestic consequences is denied by Western governments,” it said. Cage insists a “counter-terrorism industry functions around this denial.” “At each incident, this industry of counter-terrorism experts, which usually work for institutions funded by pro-war lobbies or governments, provide a shallow, naive explanation that fails to address the real causes of violence and only ever serves the neo-conservative agenda,” the NGO argued. Responding to criticism of their comments on Monday, Cage told the Times: “Our point is simply an atrocious act has occurred, and it would be wise to refrain from knee-jerk measures towards communities already affected by draconian and discriminatory policies.”","title":"War on Terror & neo-con agenda to blame for Westminster attack, says rights group  — RT UK

Images of Mrs Cochran, 46, recovering in a London hospital were posted on a GoFundMe page today set up to raise money for her and her children. In one, she stands on crutches, with her leg sheathed in a brace and a gash visible on her forehead. In another she can be seen smiling surrounded by her parents Dimmon and Sandra Payne and brother Clint Payne as she lies in bed speaking to relatives by phone. Clint said: “Her health is steadily improving and she has been strengthened by the presence of her family. She is so grateful for the outpouring of love and generosity.” Kurt Cochran, of Utah, who was killed in the Westminster terror attack, pictured with his wife Melissa. The couple, who were visiting London from the US to celebrate 25 years of marriage, were enjoying the final day of a trip of a lifetime when they were caught up in the atrocity. Mrs Cochran was left with a broken leg and rib and a badly cut head. She was comforted on the pavement in one of the defining images of the attack. Clint said: “The most difficult part of all of this is that Kurt is no longer with us, and we miss him terribly. He was an amazing individual who loved everyone and tried to make the world a better place.” The GoFundMe appeal has raised more than £56,000 since the attack on Wednesday last week. Road to recovery: Melissa Cochran in hospital Masood, who stabbed unarmed Pc Keith Palmer, 48, to death in Parliament’s New Palace Yard before being killed, is understood to have been shot dead by one of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon’s close protection team, which was waiting for the minister outside Parliament. Today, Sir Michael signalled that a security clampdown could result in new restrictions on the public accessing parts of the parliamentary estate. He made clear a review would probe whether more armed officers are needed to protect Westminster and whether public access needed to be cut back to ensure MPs’ safety.

Two reviews of security at Westminster are under way following the attack. The first, an external independent review, will examine the perimeter security of the parliamentary estate, including out-buildings. The second will focus on how Parliament responded to the incident. Armed police have this week been visibly deployed at the Carriage Gates, through which Masood ran. Victim of Westminster attack returns to the scene for vigil The body of Pc Palmer will lie in rest at Westminster’s St Mary Undercroft chapel ahead of his funeral — an honour normally reserved for heads of state. The father of one will be the first person to lie at the 13th-century chapel since Margaret Thatcher in 2013. His funeral will be held at Southwark Cathedral on April 10. A 30-year-old man arrested in Birmingham last week on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts was still being questioned in London today.","title":"First picture of Westminster terror survivor in
