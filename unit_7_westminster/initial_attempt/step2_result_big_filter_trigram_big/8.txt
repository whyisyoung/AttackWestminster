"The only people to blame for acts of terrorism are the individuals who plan and perpetrate them." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson expressed her "deep shock" at the events in London, but went on to warn would-be attackers: "We will not be silenced, and we will not be cowed."

Robertson also paid tribute to police,and the bravery of the Conservative minister who went to the aid of the stabbed officer: "'We are all hugely grateful to all the police, security staff and first responders who ran towards danger without concern to their safety, and I include in that our colleague the Right Honourable and gallant member for Bournemouth East Tobias Ellwood." Parliament is to review its security procedures in an emergency meeting later today in the wake of yesterday's terror attack.
"As acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley has made clear, we are stepping up policing to protect communities across the country and to reassure the public." May praised the security and emergency forces for their swift and calm response to the attack, made more remarkable after they had "lost one of their own".

Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott.
While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal.

Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, the prime minister confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”.
He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39355108 Great and genuine sympathy to all those who may have been killed or injured in this attack.

Fore knowledge is a very good indicator of responsibility.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/video_previews/z/0/z0m2lnyte64srj85kksess2tlpazzzl-small.jpgTHE ATTACKER"Abu Izzadeen named as suspect in London terrorist attack."

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39351280 The following appears to be a still from CCTV showing two groups of emergency workers tending the two injured parties - the assailant in the background (note policeman pointing automatic rifle) and what we must assume is the injured policeman in the foreground, there being no others.
Do we assume from this that he was actually heading back out when he was shot?http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/60/02/25/12592485/3/1024x1024.jpgIn this next image it is clear that the assailant who later died, has been removed whilst the Policeman, now deceased remains in situ.

The CCTV referred to above relating to actual moment of the crash, would clarify precisely what happened and in particular what the driver did immediately after he left the SUV and confirm that the man shot in Palace Yard, was in fact the same man that drove the vehicle.
Identical moment.http://media.graytvinc.com/images/690*388/London+Attack+4+-+MGN.jpgAgain it is reasonable to ask where is the evidence of damage to pillar or railings from what must have been a collision at speed sufficient to cause the damage to car indicated?
He (the attacker) tried to enter Parliament and was stopped at the gate.” Some might think this raises more questions than answers them.THE HERO (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Ellwood) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39351280 On 22 March 2017, during an attack on Parliament, Ellwood gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR to a stabbed police officer even though there were plenty of healthcare professionals around the victim.[11] The police officer was subsequently reported to have died.[12]Ellwood was called a "hero" by those at Westminster and the press, as photos surfaced of him with blood on his face while he crouched over the body of the dying police officer.[13]Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Opposition, was among the first to pay tribute.[14]John Crace, satirical political sketch writer for The Guardian, wrote that he had seen a man run out from the Parliament buildings to help, immediately after the attack; he didn't recognise him at first, but later found out that it was Ellwood, whom he knew.[15] This does raise the question as to what he was doing in that immediately vicinity at that time.
Who took the images of the vehicle crossing Westminster Bridge and was it just coincidental they did so in that tiny window of time?
Previous incidents both here and abroad have followed such stereotypical paths as regards the event and the way it is responded to, not to mention consistent proof of involvement by the State of Israel and/or its agents, that it would be naive to think these can be taken wholly at face value.
to the questions I raised above, the BBC has just revealed that the assailant was not shot by a policeman but by a "bodyguard"!

The attacks were seen as the deadliest act of terrorism to occur in the UK between the Second World War and the 2005 London bombings.
US Embassy bombing, Beirut The United States embassy bombing was a suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 63 people, mostly embassy staff members, several soldiers and one Marine.
A pro-Iranian group calling itself the Islamic Jihad Organization took responsibility for the bombing in a telephone call to a news office immediately after the blast.
We shall keep striking at any crusader presence in Lebanon, including the international forces.” Beirut barracks bombing In 1982, Israel invaded its neighbour Lebanon because the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) was using it as a base for its terrorist attacks.
The bomb was understood to have detonated killing three police officers as they approached it.
The bombing killed 21 people and injured 45.
A total of 15 Israeli civilians were killed and 34 wounded in the attack, which took place in Afula on April 6, at the end of the forty-day mourning period for Goldstein's victims.

They added: "My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he's acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint." Metropolitan police Khalid Masood The Metropolitan police said in a statement: "Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack.” Masood’s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife.
Northiam resident Adrian Baker, who said he had lived in the village for the past 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday: “I do remember a fracas involving a guy called Piers Mott.
While Masood is believed to have lived in a string of addresses in the south of England, London, and Luton – the latter with a 39-year-old woman understood to have been arrested in east London this week – it’s believed he most recently lived in a block of new flats on Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham near the canal.

He was in the rugby team.” Two days earlier, Masood began his attack by mounting the pavement on Westminster Bridge and driving into pedestrians, killing 51-year-old American tourist Kurt Cochran, who was celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary; 43-year-old Spanish teacher Aysha Frade, who was travelling to pick up her two young daughters from school; and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who had been visiting someone in hospital.Police and security services are investigating the background of the man who killed four people and injured dozens in a terrorist rampage at Westminster as security was visibly stepped up in the capital on Thursday.
While the Houses of Parliament prepared to sit as normal, officers were attempting to establish the motivation and any terrorist links of the attacker – who was known to counter-terrorism officials – and look into his connections and associates.
In London, extra officers – armed and unarmed – have been ordered onto the streets and Parliament Square remains closed as the capital wakes up.
