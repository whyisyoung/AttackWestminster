Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail.
"We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned," said deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing.
If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice." Appealing for members of the public to help the investigation into the killings, Basu said: "If you knew Khalid Masood and had spoken to him in the months, weeks or days leading up to this attack please come forward." —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:18 AM Family of murdered PC "overwhelmed" by support Metropolitan police The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer have said they are "overwhelmed by the love and support" they have received since the 48-year-old was killed.

—Jason Wells Posted at Mar. 27, 2017, at 16:13 PM No evidence Masood had any direct connections to ISIS or al-Qaeda, Met police say More information has emerged about the actions of the man who killed four people – including a police officer – outside the houses of parliament before being shot dead.
The Metropolitan police said the man was arrested on Sunday at an address in the city on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts.
"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other." —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:26 AM Police: Khalid Masood acted alone Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images The Metropolitan police have said they believe Westminster attacker Khalid Masood acted alone, and warned that we may never know why he acted as he did.
Masood was shot by police 82 seconds after his murderous attack began and later died, and while 11 arrests were made in the days after the attack, only one man remains in custody and one woman is out on bail.
"We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned," said deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing.
If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice." Appealing for members of the public to help the investigation into the killings, Basu said: "If you knew Khalid Masood and had spoken to him in the months, weeks or days leading up to this attack please come forward." —Matthew Champion Posted at Mar. 26, 2017, at 07:18 AM Family of murdered PC "overwhelmed" by support Metropolitan police The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer have said they are "overwhelmed by the love and support" they have received since the 48-year-old was killed.
—Salvador Hernandez Posted at Mar. 25, 2017, at 17:40 PM Only one person remains in custody over Wednesday's attack On Saturday evening police revealed that one of the two people still in custody in connection with the attack in Westminster had been released.
Seven other people have also been released and one woman remains out on bail, meaning only one person remains in custody over Khalid Masood's attack –&nbsp;a 58-year-old man who was arrested on Thursday morning at an address in Birmingham, who is being detained under anti-terror laws.
One other woman remains on police bail: a 39-year-old arrested at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts.
While police believe Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British man with a history of violent crimes, carried out the attack on Westminster Bridge and outside parliament alone, they are investigating what help he may have received and whether he had any accomplices.
Khalid Masood – born Adrian Elms – has been named as the man who killed four people and injured 50 others in an attack on Westminster on Wednesday.
Earlier, acting deputy Met police commissioner Mark Rowley said they believed Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao.
Met police release more information about Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's birth name has been stated as Adrian Russell Ajao, acting deputy police commissioner Mark Rowley has said in a briefing outside New Scotland Yard this morning.
Details around the attacker, named by the Metropolitan police as 52-year-old Khalid Masood, continue to emerge on Friday morning.
Social media was awash with people who challenged him to retract the statement after the prime minister told the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the attacker was born in Britain and had been investigated at some point by security services.
—Rose Troup Buchanan Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 13:20 PM Security services could have dropped monitoring attacker because of resources or the closure of an investigation Stressing they did not know the identity of the attacker, a former British intelligence officer told BuzzFeed News that "peripheral figure" would indicate an individual that MI5 would have looked into, and possibly monitored, for reasons of behaviour, background, or connections.
Updating parliament on the ongoing investigation into Wednesday's attack, the prime minister confirmed that the attacker, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, was born in the UK and was known to the police and intelligence services.
"The only people to blame for acts of terrorism are the individuals who plan and perpetrate them." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson expressed her "deep shock" at the events in London, but went on to warn would-be attackers: "We will not be silenced, and we will not be cowed." Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale described Westminster as a "beacon of democracy", and went on to say that "this cannot and must not turn into a war on any one community".
It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred." The Scottish National Party's leader in the House of Commons Angus Robertson echoed May and Corbyn's sentiments, saying: "Today of all days we are reminded that notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none." Robertson also paid tribute to police,and the bravery of the Conservative minister who went to the aid of the stabbed officer: "'We are all hugely grateful to all the police, security staff and first responders who ran towards danger without concern to their safety, and I include in that our colleague the Right Honourable and gallant member for Bournemouth East Tobias Ellwood." Parliament is to review its security procedures in an emergency meeting later today in the wake of yesterday's terror attack.
"As acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley has made clear, we are stepping up policing to protect communities across the country and to reassure the public." May praised the security and emergency forces for their swift and calm response to the attack, made more remarkable after they had "lost one of their own".
Posted at Mar. 23, 2017, at 09:47 AM Minute's silence held for those killed in Westminster attack The streets around parliament remained closed on Thursday morning.
Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two, was one of those killed in Wednesday's attack on Westminster, her place of work confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Thursday morning.
Met police revise death toll to four, including attacker Four people, including the attacker, died in the attack on Westminster yesterday, the Metropolitan police confirmed to BuzzFeed News this morning following Commissioner Mark Rowley's earlier statement.
Previous statements from New Scotland Yard had said that five people – including the attacker –&nbsp;had been killed in the assault outside the British parliament.
"I do want to reassure you that the police and the security services are doing everything possible to make sure that people can go about their daily life as safely as possible." The Metropolitan police confirm seven arrests made last night Mark Rowley, the national lead for counterterrorism policing and the acting deputy commissioner, confirmed that seven arrests had been made, following raids on six properties across the country.
Among the dead were a "mix of nationalities", Rowley said, declining to name any of those killed other than 48-year-old police officer Keith Palmer.
Meanwhile, he said London will see an increased police presence, as at least 60 officers continue working on a "large and complicated crime scene" outside Westminster.
The BBC subsequently said it had been told police confirmed the raids were linked to the attack outside Westminster on Wednesday afternoon.
The officer, 48-year-old Keith Palmer, was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic command, said Mark Rowley, the acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police.
The identify of the attacker had not been released, but Rowley said police believe he was inspired by international terrorism.

"The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions, and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy, and freedom of speech." The single attacker first drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, May said, killing two people and injuring others – including three police officers.
The prime minister praised police and emergency responders, and said parliament would return to its business as normal on Thursday, as would other Londoners.

"We obviously condemn today's attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism, and we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation," he said.
"The attack started when a car was driven over Westminster Bridge hitting and injuring a number of members of the public, including three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony," Rowley said.
He added that police "we're satisfied at this stage that there looks to be only one attacker but it would be foolish to be over-confident so early on."

"I shall endeavour to do the very best I can, both at the despatch box and by communicating with my opposite numbers in other political parties to ensure that members are kept aware of what is happening, but at the moment, the very clear advice from the police and the director of security in the house is that we should remain under suspension and that the chamber should remain in lockdown until we receive advice that it is safe to go back to normal procedures." —Marie Le Conte Posted at Mar. 22, 2017, at 15:10 PM This is the scene outside parliament shortly after the incident Phil Han / BuzzFeed News Parliament Square is being closed and cleared, with an emergency helicopter parked in the middle of the area.Westminster attack: Everything we know so far A 52-year-old ex-convict from Birmingham was named on Thursday as the man who carried out the terrorist attack on Westminster in which he and four other people died, while eight others were arrested as police hunted for evidence of a wider conspiracy.Khalid Masood, a man who had used a string of aliases, was described by police as a criminal with a 20-year record of offending, who had once been investigated for extremism but was assessed as posing a low risk.It was being reported that Masood’s birth name was Adrian Elms and that he had converted to Islam.Theresa May told MPs Masood had been previously known to MI5: “Some years ago, he was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism.
The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture.”Amber Rudd, the home secretary, later added that Masood had spent time in jail, but not for terrorist offences, while the Metropolitan police said “Masood” was in all likelihood not his birth name.Live London terror attack: 75-year-old man becomes fourth victim – live updatesPolice name Khalid Masood, 52, born in Kent as man responsible for attack in which three victims have died and seven more are critically injuredRead moreThe names of two people who died after Masood mowed them down on Westminster Bridge also emerged.They were Kurt Cochran, 54, a US tourist from Utah celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary, and British-born Aysha Frade, 43, who worked at sixth-form college and had been walking over the bridge to pick up her daughters from school.In the frenzied attack on Wednesday, Masood also stabbed to death PC Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old husband and father.Police said on Thursday night that a 75-year-old male victim had died in hospital.

A police officer who was nearby because of an earlier gas leak was on the scene in a minute and shot and killed the attacker.The FBI and other agencies joined the investigation.Authorities say nine people were hurt, one of them critically."THE ATTACKhttp://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/2017/newsspec_16174/img/westminster_shooting_v03_976.pngA question arises how the following still from a video was possible and by whom given the fact that the incident began only seconds before with no advance warning?
Fore knowledge is a very good indicator of responsibility.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/video_previews/z/0/z0m2lnyte64srj85kksess2tlpazzzl-small.jpgTHE ATTACKER"Abu Izzadeen named as suspect in London terrorist attack."

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39351280 The following appears to be a still from CCTV showing two groups of emergency workers tending the two injured parties - the assailant in the background (note policeman pointing automatic rifle) and what we must assume is the injured policeman in the foreground, there being no others.
Do we assume from this that he was actually heading back out when he was shot?http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/60/02/25/12592485/3/1024x1024.jpgIn this next image it is clear that the assailant who later died, has been removed whilst the Policeman, now deceased remains in situ.
What is rather strange is that the whole crime scene appears to have been totally deserted by police and other emergency services.http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2017/03/body-covered-with-sheet-UK-Houses-of-Parliament-22-March-2017-620x356.jpgA wider view, now flooded with heavily armed policemen (after the horse has bolted some might say) but before the one above.
Where and why the use of blue surgical gloves by non-medics?http://en.trend.az/world/other/2734320.htmlTHE ATTACK VEHICLEhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39351280Undoubtedly, as evidenced by this still, there will be CCT coverage of the moment the vehicle crashed into the railings (if it did) In fact given the location and its high security status there are sure multiple versions available to the police.
The CCTV referred to above relating to actual moment of the crash, would clarify precisely what happened and in particular what the driver did immediately after he left the SUV and confirm that the man shot in Palace Yard, was in fact the same man that drove the vehicle.
Identical moment.http://media.graytvinc.com/images/690*388/London+Attack+4+-+MGN.jpgAgain it is reasonable to ask where is the evidence of damage to pillar or railings from what must have been a collision at speed sufficient to cause the damage to car indicated?
He (the attacker) tried to enter Parliament and was stopped at the gate.” Some might think this raises more questions than answers them.THE HERO (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Ellwood) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39351280 On 22 March 2017, during an attack on Parliament, Ellwood gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR to a stabbed police officer even though there were plenty of healthcare professionals around the victim.[11] The police officer was subsequently reported to have died.[12]Ellwood was called a "hero" by those at Westminster and the press, as photos surfaced of him with blood on his face while he crouched over the body of the dying police officer.[13]Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Opposition, was among the first to pay tribute.[14]John Crace, satirical political sketch writer for The Guardian, wrote that he had seen a man run out from the Parliament buildings to help, immediately after the attack; he didn't recognise him at first, but later found out that it was Ellwood, whom he knew.[15] This does raise the question as to what he was doing in that immediately vicinity at that time.
Who took the images of the vehicle crossing Westminster Bridge and was it just coincidental they did so in that tiny window of time?
Previous incidents both here and abroad have followed such stereotypical paths as regards the event and the way it is responded to, not to mention consistent proof of involvement by the State of Israel and/or its agents, that it would be naive to think these can be taken wholly at face value.
to the questions I raised above, the BBC has just revealed that the assailant was not shot by a policeman but by a "bodyguard"!
(See: http://www.reubenbrothers.com/millbank-tower/) It is also the location of the firm highlighted by Ole Dammegard: "CRISIS SOLUTIONS" (See: http://www.crisis-solutions.com/) This firm is also located there: https://www.altitudelondon.com/about-us/whats-new-at-altitude/ As far as I am aware, no one has come forward to accept responsibility for that film, nor for that matter how the vehicle on a bridge dense with slow moving traffic, was able to get back in the traffic lane and at speed crash into the masonry pillar and railings without doing any damage to them or any cyclists that would have been using the dedicated lane.Pedestrians were also hit by a vehicle on the nearby Westminster Bridge.Published OnMarch 22, 2017CreditCreditImage by Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times LONDON — A knife-wielding assailant driving a sport utility vehicle mowed down panicked pedestrians and stabbed a police officer outside Parliament on Wednesday in a deadly assault, prompting the hasty evacuation of the prime minister and punctuating the threat of terrorism in Europe.
