Who took the images of the vehicle crossing Westminster Bridge and was it just coincidental they did so in that tiny window of time?
Previous incidents both here and abroad have followed such stereotypical paths as regards the event and the way it is responded to, not to mention consistent proof of involvement by the State of Israel and/or its agents, that it would be naive to think these can be taken wholly at face value.

According to multiple witnesses, however, shortly after 2.30pm a car travelled at speed across Westminster Bridge in the direction of parliament, mounting the pavement and careering into pedestrians.
Having careered to the eastern end of the bridge, immediately beneath Big Ben, the car, a dark grey Hyundai i40, sharply crossed the cycle lane and mounted the pavement again, before crashing into the black railings that enclose the parliament complex, striking at least one other person.
Alan Parry, of Sky Sports News, was just outside Westminster underground station, immediately opposite the scene, when he heard “an almighty crash” and saw the crashed car.
She did not see what happened to the driver of the vehicle, but police later confirmed that it was this man – not, as was initially feared, an accomplice – who seconds later dashed on foot through the gates of the parliamentary complex.

This is our daily news that we feel is important & we want to tell people about the truth behind the story " #AceSecurityNews – Thursday’s Westminster London attack and Khalid Masood using WhatsApp to send a message has reopened privacy debate Theresa May wants Google, Apple and Facebook to allow release of private date on their smartphones to authorities – @AceNewsServices #AceNewsReport – Mar.27: British officials have demanded tech firms do much more to give #police access to smartphone communications following last week’s Westminster attack, just months after new laws gave security services broader powers.
A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday she wanted tech firms such as Facebook, Apple and Google to find ways to give security services access to messages on phones, but was leaving it up to companies to sort out how.
On Sunday Home Secretary (interior minister) Amber Rudd called for the tech companies to give security services access to encrypted messaging systems, then later qualified her stronger statements, saying she supported user privacy.
Later, when speaking to Sky News, she appeared to pull back on calling on tech firms to undermine encryption protections and focused instead on demanding lawful access to phones.
